## How to use

Type `gl` and then the name of a project (2 chars min).

Confirm a result to open it on your default browser.

## Troubleshooting

Use `.glc` command (no arguments) to clear all the result caches.

Use this if there are new projects that do not appear in results, or user/group scoping has changed.

## Requirements

- Needs a
  [GitLab personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
  to work
- Needs [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) to be installed
