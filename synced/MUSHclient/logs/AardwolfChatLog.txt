@w[14 Sep 03:04:24] @GAreia Tech@w: @CKumo: Easiest way probably would be to turn roomname tags on. You could make a trigger that matches ^\{rname\}The Grand City of Aylor \(G\)$  or whatever room name you wanted. You'd have to do a tiny bit of extra work to hide the {rname} tags if you wanted to do that. Otherwise, the MUD sends room data through GMCP. That option's a little more complicated if you're not familiar with GMCP, but you can get more info that way.

@w[26 Sep 22:56:28] @MRhavage gametalks@w: @YSo the key to the question is that the numbers announced were the numbers drawn from the night before. The number 56 means that the next four number HAD to be 57, 58, 59, and 60

@w[26 Sep 22:57:58] @MVettir gametalks@w: @YSince lottery numbers are usually read in order, the only way to know it was a win under the constraints from number 1 is if it was the last 5 numbers.

@w[28 Sep 11:27:34] @cGorsk tells you 'you should be using your mage spells'
@w[28 Sep 11:28:31] @cGorsk tells you 'so from now on, put everything into int'
@w[28 Sep 11:29:29] @cYou tell Gorsk 'yeah, i will'
@w[28 Sep 11:29:53] @cGorsk tells you 'what're your stats right now?'
@w[28 Sep 11:30:41] @cYou tell Gorsk 'Str    Int    Wis    Dex    Con    Luck   Total'

@w[28 Sep 11:31:11] @GCLAN: Spublofe falls out to take some much needed R & R.
@w[28 Sep 11:31:43] @cYou tell Gorsk 'i kinda maxed them out by the order in help newbie-stats every few levels so i guess i didn't have a lot to go off the track'
@w[28 Sep 11:32:19] @cYou tell Gorsk 'mostly that con was maxed before int/wis'
@w[28 Sep 11:32:38] @cYou tell Gorsk 'but i still some into these '
@w[28 Sep 11:32:40] @cGorsk tells you 'you have a primary class and remort classes. your primary class is your main and all the others are there for passives and spellups'
@w[28 Sep 11:33:16] @cGorsk tells you 'and utility abilites too for others'
@w[28 Sep 11:33:34] @cYou tell Gorsk 'So that makes tiering the real "re-class", that kinda makes more sense'
@w[28 Sep 11:33:57] @cGorsk tells you 'yes, tiering lets you change your primary class'
@w[28 Sep 11:34:03] @cGorsk tells you 'but so does classchange'
@w[28 Sep 11:34:22] @GCLAN: At-ten-tion! Spublofe is here to get some training done!
@w[28 Sep 11:34:47] @cYou tell Gorsk 'i probably won't class change until i know what i'm doing (which is clearly not yet)'
@w[28 Sep 11:34:51] @cGorsk tells you 'you have 2 categories of classes. casting classes and martial classes'
@w[28 Sep 11:35:03] @cGorsk tells you 'casting classes are psi, cleric and mage'
@w[28 Sep 11:35:15] @cGorsk tells you 'martial classes are warrior, thief, ranger and paladin'
@w[28 Sep 11:35:33] @RINFO: All hail Bloodedge! Champion of Kimr's Farm!@w
@w[28 Sep 11:35:44] @cGorsk tells you 'if your primary is a casting class, you want your 2nd class to be a martial one'
@w[28 Sep 11:36:12] @cGorsk tells you 'normally, warrior is preferred cause it has some skills that other martial classes don't'
@w[28 Sep 11:36:38] @cGorsk tells you 'if your primary class is a martial, you want your next 3 to be psi, cle and mage. normally, in that order'
@w[28 Sep 11:37:03] @cGorsk tells you 'though, not always depending on skill overlaps'
@w[28 Sep 11:37:34] @cGorsk tells you 'for example, if your primary class is paladin, you have alot of overlap with cleric so you might want to do psi, mage, cleric'
@w[28 Sep 11:37:53] @cGorsk tells you 'but generally it's psi, cleric, mage'
@w[28 Sep 11:38:21] @cGorsk tells you 'even as a primary caster, you want to get the other 2 casting classes'
@w[28 Sep 11:38:38] @cGorsk tells you 'but after your martial classs (which you have)'
@w[28 Sep 11:38:57] @cGorsk tells you 'so your next class should probably be psi and the one after that should be cleric'
@w[28 Sep 11:39:26] @cGorsk tells you 'psi is the first class on that list cause many of its spellups are self-only'
@w[28 Sep 11:39:38] @cGorsk tells you 'whereas mage and cleric spells can be cast on you by others'
@w[28 Sep 11:40:05] @cGorsk tells you 'cleric goes before mage cause of the utility spells it has such as cure blindness and herbal remedy'
@w[28 Sep 11:42:02] @cGorsk tells you 'so that's a brief explanation of classes and their order'
@w[28 Sep 11:43:22] @cYou tell Gorsk 'thanks!'

@w[29 Sep 02:10:34] @GSelitos Tech@w: @Ckeep in mind Weaponguy that the plugin does not nessassrily wear the highestest lvl item it wears the items that will best max your pclass stats
@w[29 Sep 02:12:21] @GWeaponGuy Tech@w: @CI understand that. But I'm pretty sure a level 100 aard dagger with no added stats is always better than a level 80 aard dagger with no added stats.
@w[29 Sep 02:13:05] @GSelitos Tech@w: @Ctheoretically yes, unoless the plugin doesn't know the stats of the 100 dagger
@w[29 Sep 02:13:34] @GBreathe Tech@w: @CI have the same issue - dinv doesn't wear the better aard daggers for me.  But I don't refresh enough, so maybe that is why and I temper my weapons 
@w[29 Sep 02:13:45] @GWeaponGuy Tech@w: @CIt should by now, as it's been inventoried dozens of times.
@w[29 Sep 02:13:53] @GEvl Tech@w: @Cyeah gotta refresh after every temper
@w[29 Sep 02:14:10] @GSelitos Tech@w: @Cyes if you temper the item the plugin assume it no longer knows the satats on the item and ignores it
@w[29 Sep 02:14:36] @GEvl Tech@w: @Cwhen i get time im gonna fix that and make it default to the known stats

@w[01 Oct 10:12:52] @GDar Tech@w: @Cif you haven't visited the room and added it to your mapper, of course it wouldn't know how to get there

@w[02 Oct 16:03:41] @YZoth (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'It levels with you, but then it stays at 201 when you remort'
@w[02 Oct 16:03:46] @YZoth (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'So you can get it whenever you like'
@w[02 Oct 16:03:54] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'ah, and its better than shop bags?'

@w[02 Oct 16:04:43] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'for the resistances?'
@w[02 Oct 16:04:45] @YZoth (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'It's 80% weight reduction bag and it does some negative weight just having it also'

@w[02 Oct 16:07:25] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'ah right'
@w[02 Oct 16:07:33] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'probably going thief or warrior'
@w[02 Oct 16:08:31] @YWinger (@GSoldier@Y) tells the CLAN: 'do thief last'

@w[02 Oct 16:10:17] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'One thing to consider re: weight - once you've hit SH, do a bit of pupping (not TOO much, but some) and train up some strength/dex.'
@w[02 Oct 16:10:35] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: '"help capacity" - your str/dex at SH actually helps your carry capacity *after* you remort.'
@w[02 Oct 16:11:26] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Also, I see nobody mentioned "help newbie-aard" :V'
@w[02 Oct 16:11:37] @YFlynnt (@GSoldier@Y) tells the CLAN: 'most people tend to find that after a few morts/tiers they struggle more with # of items than actual weight, per what Epsilon is pointing you toward'

@w[02 Oct 16:12:34] @GCLAN: At-ten-tion! Anssett is here to get some training done!
@w[02 Oct 16:12:34] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'By the way, the theory behind "buy at level 1" is that it'll allow you to get maximum use out of the items. Basically all of them have some effect besides their baseline item type that's potentially useful.'
@w[02 Oct 16:12:54] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'So yes, a breastplate has +100 to all magic damage type resists, which you are NOT finding on any other item.'
@w[02 Oct 16:13:10] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Aura of Sanctuary has permanent sanctuary, helm of truesight has detects, etc. etc.'

@w[02 Oct 16:14:42] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Aura/BP are your pro level 1 buys.'
@w[02 Oct 16:14:43] @Y(@GSpecial Ops@Y) CLAN: Anssett nods at Epsilon.
@w[02 Oct 16:14:45] @Y(@GSoldier@Y) CLAN: Winger blinks innocently at Anssett.
@w[02 Oct 16:14:50] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'I don't think anyone's going to disagree with that one.'
@w[02 Oct 16:14:50] @YZoth (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: '4500 of that should go to level 1 aura and bp'
@w[02 Oct 16:15:00] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Beyond that, it's kind of up to you.'
@w[02 Oct 16:15:06] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'i mean i'm tempted to just to annoy you eps'

@w[02 Oct 16:15:20] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'bitch i will punch you right in the sauna'
@w[02 Oct 16:15:28] @Y(@GSpecial Ops@Y) CLAN: Epsilon leans comfortably against Anssett.
@w[02 Oct 16:15:45] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'joke's on you, i don't like hot and humid. that's why i live in the ... us southeast ... :('

@w[02 Oct 16:15:55] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'You don't even have to buy all the Aard gear - I've skipped the bracers and boots, for example. Disarm doesn't bother me, and I get haste early.'
@w[02 Oct 16:15:59] @Y(@GSoldier@Y) CLAN: Winger fires an arrow at Zensch, hitting him right between the eyes.
@w[02 Oct 16:16:07] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'And the only reason I have gloves is because I picked them up on rauc for hella cheap.'
@w[02 Oct 16:16:28] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'iirc the stats are the primary reason to grab the lev 1 aardgear outside of the affects'
@w[02 Oct 16:16:32] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'nice stats for that level range'
@w[02 Oct 16:16:40] @Y(@GSpecial Ops@Y) CLAN: Epsilon nods.
@w[02 Oct 16:16:42] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'after level 1 you have to do math to see if it's worth'

@w[02 Oct 16:17:58] @YWinger (@GSoldier@Y) tells the CLAN: 'something else to consider though, the quest items are easier to find at level, whereas you may need to hunt or scour auction waiting for a better onlevel bloot item'

@w[02 Oct 16:19:12] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'if you're not one-shotting mobs below lev 50-80, you should be looking to beef up a bit imo :p'
@w[02 Oct 16:19:15] @YWinger (@GSoldier@Y) tells the CLAN: 'i know, that's what i'm saying, I'm level 100, i can find a nice quest item, vs having to hunt or hope for a good item on auction'
@w[02 Oct 16:19:47] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'other resource: 1s clan recall, talbor'

@w[07 Oct 00:24:11] @GTrachx Tech@w: @CI think they (hp) just try cut costs too much
@w[07 Oct 00:25:35] @GTrachx Tech@w: @CI would pick dell, but that is just because at work we mostly use dells

@w[07 Oct 00:27:54] @GPapawolf Tech@w: @Cyeah I have a dell from work that is pretty lousy construction, (though really good specs), and a dell tower desktop I like okay, the I have only ever played with a couple of lenovo's and I liked their construction quality better

@w[07 Oct 18:27:47] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'question guys'
@w[07 Oct 18:27:58] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'is it considered "botting" if i'm using potion quaffer plugin?'
@w[07 Oct 18:28:02] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'to heal mana or heal hp?'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:01] @YKitrana (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'why would it matter either way?'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:17] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Cuz if its illegal I gotta stop using the plugin'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:21] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'only if you go afk'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:27] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'in an aggy room'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:33] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'ahh okay, cool'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:35] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'if you can answer right away you are good'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:38] @GWeaponGuy questions 'Any idea why I can't see in dark rooms when I have a light?'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:40] @YKitrana (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'oh i thought someone else had asked about mana or hp'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:51] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'copy, good enuf then'
@w[07 Oct 18:29:59] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'does this apply to re-casting attack spell too?'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:00] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'but do understand if you accidently stop in an aggy room and are autoquaffing to stay alive, you will get in trouble'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:01] @GFlaw answers 'its really dark, need night vision'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:01] @YKitrana (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'where does one get these glorious plugins?'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:07] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'yes'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:20] @GWeaponGuy questions 'Okay. Thanks.'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:27] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'So as long as not afk, auto-quaff, auto-recast is ok'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:38] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'autocast is alil more iffy, but again, never have it on if you have to leave for anything'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:45] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'yeah'
@w[07 Oct 18:30:53] @GCLAN: At-ten-tion! Anssett is here to get some training done!
@w[07 Oct 18:30:55] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'they wont even give warnings'
@w[07 Oct 18:31:13] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'I have a autorecaster, but it only fires if i manually cast the spell first'
@w[07 Oct 18:32:03] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'But I dont wanna break any rules, seems like there are many. Thanks for clarifying.'
@w[07 Oct 18:32:13] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'np'
@w[07 Oct 18:32:39] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'i don't use a lot of the autocaster type things bc i don't like the idea of em'
@w[07 Oct 18:32:47] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'and for me they're too close to the bot side of things'
@w[07 Oct 18:32:54] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'its an iffy thing'
@w[07 Oct 18:32:57] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'but that's personal perspective, not a rule i've been directed toward'
@w[07 Oct 18:33:01] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'nod'
@w[07 Oct 18:33:23] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'its a close line and very easy to get caught if something happens and you have to afk in an aggy area'
@w[07 Oct 18:33:26] @Y(@GSpecial Ops@Y) CLAN: Anssett nods.
@w[07 Oct 18:33:54] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'I'm assuming afking in an aggy area regardless is an offense right?'
@w[07 Oct 18:34:07] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'whether u are attacking or not, u can't afk in aggy area from what I understand'
@w[07 Oct 18:34:14] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'yeah but tens times worse if autoquaffing and casting :P'
@w[07 Oct 18:34:21] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'haha true'
@w[07 Oct 18:34:27] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'you most likely will just die in an aggy area'
@w[07 Oct 18:34:31] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'it's a good rule of thumb. technically ify ou don't win the fights, it won't matter so eh? but if you don't die to the aggies then yeah. that's effectively botting lol'
@w[07 Oct 18:34:34] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'noone gonna blink at that'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:05] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'So what's the best approach? Just stack estimated # of attacks you think it'd take to kill the mob you're fighting?'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:06] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'I feel like we've had this conversation before...'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:10] @Y(@GSpecial Ops@Y) CLAN: Epsilon peers intently at Dejavu.
@w[07 Oct 18:35:21] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'best approach to what'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:25] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'killing baddies?'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:26] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'to casting'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:27] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'yeah'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:29] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'don't afk'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:29] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Stay stacked 1-2 deep, which allows you to respond to damage by quaffing.'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:30] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'rofl'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:31] @YMadrox (@GGeneral@Y) tells the CLAN: 'probably the safe bet'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:37] @Y(@GSpecial Ops@Y) CLAN: Epsilon rapidly nods twice at Anssett, in complete agreement.
@w[07 Oct 18:35:39] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'no need to stack realy'
@w[07 Oct 18:35:56] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'or pick enemies that won't eat your face if you stack 10 spells'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:05] @YKitrana (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'how do i find a good potion bag?'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:09] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'eh, I like staying stacked at least 1 spell deep, but I imagine if you're killing stuff in 2-3 rounds anyway...'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:14] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: '"help newbie-container"'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:15] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'uh'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:17] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'yeah'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:19] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'or buy an aardbag'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:21] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'For the "potion bag"'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:29] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Cool I gotcha..appreciate the advise :)'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:33] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'as far as i know there aren't any bags that are optimized for potions'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:39] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'whatever that would lookl ike lol'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:43] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Oh yeah, Aard bag is good, but you should probably stick with clan bags 'til you've got your Aard gear.'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:44] @YKitrana (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'i don't have qp for an aard bag'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:48] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'aard bag is optimized for everything haha'
@w[07 Oct 18:36:59] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'then yeah newbie-container willg et you in your best direction for the moment'
@w[07 Oct 18:37:03] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'High numbers, high reduction, low (13) weight per item probably. :P'
@w[07 Oct 18:37:06] @YDejavu (@GRecruit@Y) tells the CLAN: 'just get clan backpack, Kitrana.'

@w[07 Oct 18:37:48] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'Actually, I guess middling numbers would be fine since you can't *really* carry around more than 200-300 potions typically.'
@w[07 Oct 18:38:03] @YEpsilon (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'I mean, you can load up entirely, but you're going to have a baseline of "random crap" you always carry with you. :p'
@w[07 Oct 18:38:10] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'yup'

@w[07 Oct 18:53:25] @Y(@GSpecial Ops@Y) CLAN: Hmm. You could swear Epsilon has been here just a second ago. You wonder where he went ...

@w[09 Oct 00:27:19] @YAnssett (@GSpecial Ops@Y) tells the CLAN: 'but planes also has the problem of 2 areas in similar ranges with the same design, so if you want to avoid planes you have to consume 2 bypass slots'

@w[10 Oct 18:13:08] @GKulton Tech@w: @Cah, ok. sounds too complicate for me.  :)
@w[10 Oct 18:13:48] @GCrowley Tech@w: @CCreate a Lua table to act as the array, though.

@w[10 Oct 18:17:51] @GKulton Tech@w: @Csounds very useful. alright, I will get it.

@w[10 Oct 18:29:00] @GSelitos Tech@w: @Cdinv gives you the cmd to use the portal, to add it to the mapper is is just mapper portal <dinv> cmd
@w[10 Oct 18:29:04] @GCrowley Tech@w: @CBut first things first, use an alias like 'port *'

@w[10 Oct 18:30:54] @GAnssett Tech@w: @Cofc i also don't like using non permanent portals so it's not a use case i would need anyway heh

@w[10 Oct 20:30:11] @GYuna Tech@w: @CDoes anyone know what the Stop command actually does? Because it does more than just invalidates anything you've sent to the MUD already. With the conwin plugin, it acts the same as if you disconnect and reconnect, requiring a restart to work. With SnD, if you killed a target mob and hadn't yet cleared it from your SnD list, it will temporarily break SnD until you do a campaign info (and possibly quest info?). So clearly it's doing something client-side as well.

@w[10 Oct 20:54:51] @GSath Tech@w: @CI mean, it's obviously an intentional feature to prevent you from entering a speedwalk while a speedwalk is currently executing

@w[10 Oct 20:55:23] @GSath Tech@w: @Cso you lose a quarter second per mapper goto

@w[10 Oct 20:55:30] @GCrowley Tech@w: @CI believe it also assists when determining that you haven't actually left the room or reached your destination room (prison rooms, for example).

@w[10 Oct 21:01:00] @GStormwind Tech@w: @Cyou have the timing it takes to grab the portal, equip it, enter it, remove it, put it back, then run to the mob.  If I manually type run 234234 it ends up being quicker in a lot of instances I've run into when I'm in the same area.
@w[10 Oct 21:01:05] @GDixon Tech@w: @Ctheir right tho, mapper thinks a portal usage == 1 room of movement, where it should be higher
@w[10 Oct 21:01:26] @GCLAN: At-ten-tion! Zensch is here to get some training done!
@w[10 Oct 21:01:41] @GDixon Tech@w: @Cportal usage should have a weight that can be set by the user, but it should probably be somewhere closer to 6 or so rooms
@w[10 Oct 21:01:43] @GPorcius Tech@w: @Ctrue dat
@w[10 Oct 21:01:55] @GStormwind Tech@w: @CFiendish explained it that it calculates based on movements.  10 rooms away is 10 movements, where as using a portal is 1 movement, and 8 rooms away.  it will chose the portal because it's less movements even if running directly from a-b within the same area is technically quicker.
@w[10 Oct 21:02:07] @GSath Tech@w: @Cgotcha, you were just exaggerating
@w[10 Oct 21:02:27] @GStormwind Tech@w: @CI tend to do that yes.
@w[10 Oct 21:02:33] @GSath Tech@w: @CFWIW, you can drop it down as low as 2 commands if you just don't bag your portals :)

@w[10 Oct 21:03:46] @GDixon Tech@w: @Calso should have a higher weight
@w[10 Oct 21:04:15] @GSath Tech@w: @Cthat one is impossible with the way the mapper is designed, since you can't see those rooms until you get there

@w[10 Oct 21:13:39] @GSath Tech@w: @Cso it sends all the commands before you have any information about aggro mobs except for a couple adjacent rooms
