@w[14 Sep 03:04:24] @GAreia Tech@w: @CKumo: Easiest way probably would be to turn roomname tags on. You could make a trigger that matches ^\{rname\}The Grand City of Aylor \(G\)$  or whatever room name you wanted. You'd have to do a tiny bit of extra work to hide the {rname} tags if you wanted to do that. Otherwise, the MUD sends room data through GMCP. That option's a little more complicated if you're not familiar with GMCP, but you can get more info that way.

@w[26 Sep 22:55:08] @MFeast gametalks@w: @YWell, you're driving to work, so we can assume it is neither Saturday or Sunday. 
@w[26 Sep 22:55:19] @MRhavage gametalks@w: @YLottery numbers are drawn randomly. But they're *reported* in consecutive order. 
@w[26 Sep 22:55:22] @MAnssett gametalks@w: @Ybecause nobody works on weekends *nod

@w[26 Sep 22:56:28] @MRhavage gametalks@w: @YSo the key to the question is that the numbers announced were the numbers drawn from the night before. The number 56 means that the next four number HAD to be 57, 58, 59, and 60

@w[26 Sep 22:57:58] @MVettir gametalks@w: @YSince lottery numbers are usually read in order, the only way to know it was a win under the constraints from number 1 is if it was the last 5 numbers.

@w[28 Sep 11:27:04] @cGorsk tells you 'lol'
@w[28 Sep 11:27:34] @cGorsk tells you 'you should be using your mage spells'
@w[28 Sep 11:28:31] @cGorsk tells you 'so from now on, put everything into int'
@w[28 Sep 11:29:29] @cYou tell Gorsk 'yeah, i will'
@w[28 Sep 11:29:53] @cGorsk tells you 'what're your stats right now?'
@w[28 Sep 11:30:41] @cYou tell Gorsk 'Str    Int    Wis    Dex    Con    Luck   Total'
@w[28 Sep 11:30:43] @cYou tell Gorsk 'Natural       :   74     57     76     63     88      45    403'

@w[28 Sep 11:31:11] @GCLAN: Spublofe falls out to take some much needed R & R.
@w[28 Sep 11:31:43] @cYou tell Gorsk 'i kinda maxed them out by the order in help newbie-stats every few levels so i guess i didn't have a lot to go off the track'
@w[28 Sep 11:32:19] @cYou tell Gorsk 'mostly that con was maxed before int/wis'
@w[28 Sep 11:32:38] @cYou tell Gorsk 'but i still some into these '
@w[28 Sep 11:32:40] @cGorsk tells you 'you have a primary class and remort classes. your primary class is your main and all the others are there for passives and spellups'
@w[28 Sep 11:33:16] @cGorsk tells you 'and utility abilites too for others'
@w[28 Sep 11:33:34] @cYou tell Gorsk 'So that makes tiering the real "re-class", that kinda makes more sense'
@w[28 Sep 11:33:57] @cGorsk tells you 'yes, tiering lets you change your primary class'
@w[28 Sep 11:34:03] @cGorsk tells you 'but so does classchange'
@w[28 Sep 11:34:22] @GCLAN: At-ten-tion! Spublofe is here to get some training done!
@w[28 Sep 11:34:47] @cYou tell Gorsk 'i probably won't class change until i know what i'm doing (which is clearly not yet)'
@w[28 Sep 11:34:51] @cGorsk tells you 'you have 2 categories of classes. casting classes and martial classes'
@w[28 Sep 11:35:03] @cGorsk tells you 'casting classes are psi, cleric and mage'
@w[28 Sep 11:35:15] @cGorsk tells you 'martial classes are warrior, thief, ranger and paladin'
@w[28 Sep 11:35:33] @RINFO: All hail Bloodedge! Champion of Kimr's Farm!@w
@w[28 Sep 11:35:44] @cGorsk tells you 'if your primary is a casting class, you want your 2nd class to be a martial one'
@w[28 Sep 11:36:12] @cGorsk tells you 'normally, warrior is preferred cause it has some skills that other martial classes don't'
@w[28 Sep 11:36:38] @cGorsk tells you 'if your primary class is a martial, you want your next 3 to be psi, cle and mage. normally, in that order'
@w[28 Sep 11:37:03] @cGorsk tells you 'though, not always depending on skill overlaps'
@w[28 Sep 11:37:34] @cGorsk tells you 'for example, if your primary class is paladin, you have alot of overlap with cleric so you might want to do psi, mage, cleric'
@w[28 Sep 11:37:53] @cGorsk tells you 'but generally it's psi, cleric, mage'
@w[28 Sep 11:38:21] @cGorsk tells you 'even as a primary caster, you want to get the other 2 casting classes'
@w[28 Sep 11:38:38] @cGorsk tells you 'but after your martial classs (which you have)'
@w[28 Sep 11:38:57] @cGorsk tells you 'so your next class should probably be psi and the one after that should be cleric'
@w[28 Sep 11:39:26] @cGorsk tells you 'psi is the first class on that list cause many of its spellups are self-only'
@w[28 Sep 11:39:38] @cGorsk tells you 'whereas mage and cleric spells can be cast on you by others'
@w[28 Sep 11:40:05] @cGorsk tells you 'cleric goes before mage cause of the utility spells it has such as cure blindness and herbal remedy'
@w[28 Sep 11:42:02] @cGorsk tells you 'so that's a brief explanation of classes and their order'
@w[28 Sep 11:43:22] @cYou tell Gorsk 'thanks!'

@w[29 Sep 02:10:34] @GSelitos Tech@w: @Ckeep in mind Weaponguy that the plugin does not nessassrily wear the highestest lvl item it wears the items that will best max your pclass stats
@w[29 Sep 02:12:21] @GWeaponGuy Tech@w: @CI understand that. But I'm pretty sure a level 100 aard dagger with no added stats is always better than a level 80 aard dagger with no added stats.
@w[29 Sep 02:13:05] @GSelitos Tech@w: @Ctheoretically yes, unoless the plugin doesn't know the stats of the 100 dagger
@w[29 Sep 02:13:34] @GBreathe Tech@w: @CI have the same issue - dinv doesn't wear the better aard daggers for me.  But I don't refresh enough, so maybe that is why and I temper my weapons 
@w[29 Sep 02:13:45] @GWeaponGuy Tech@w: @CIt should by now, as it's been inventoried dozens of times.
@w[29 Sep 02:13:53] @GEvl Tech@w: @Cyeah gotta refresh after every temper
@w[29 Sep 02:14:10] @GSelitos Tech@w: @Cyes if you temper the item the plugin assume it no longer knows the satats on the item and ignores it
@w[29 Sep 02:14:36] @GEvl Tech@w: @Cwhen i get time im gonna fix that and make it default to the known stats

@w[01 Oct 10:12:52] @GDar Tech@w: @Cif you haven't visited the room and added it to your mapper, of course it wouldn't know how to get there

@w[01 Oct 10:14:13] @GYtrams Tech@w: @Clet me repeat :) I just had 2 GQs in a row. One with Areas and one with Rooms. Areas - all fine. Rooms - all lines in SD are red and none of them works.
