Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
CLAN: At-ten-tion! KumoGami is here to get some training done!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.
There are 208 players on, the most on this reboot was 254.
There are 206 players using compression.

Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
CLAN: At-ten-tion! KumoGami is here to get some training done!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  This is a gloomy sort of intersection where the ground and the air both hold 
a grey shade. There is little to see on the corner of GreyAsh Alley and 
Silvermist Road other than a large manor covered by a large, white tent.
Three massive cannons defend the front lawn, and a stable of warhorses sits 
off to the side. Funny, you think, how, with the grey of ash and the silver 
of mist, a war scene seems fitting. A massive chain dangles above you.

A room with a view! (Atop the platform)
  You made it, and the view is worth the effort! Peering into the distance you 
see mountain ranges, villages, and the green carpet of vast forests. The 
thrumming of enormous power vibrates through the platform, and apparently it 
keeps the platform and the entire prison above the clouds. The massive chain 
leads down, and a metal door leads up into the prison fortress. The only sign
of dragons here, despite the rumors, is the dragon scale anchoring the chain 
leading down.

Dark and forgotten
  
You drop lightly onto possibly the most filthy floor you've ever seen. The 
only illumination comes from your own light source, but it clearly outlines 
the many bones littering the tiny room. Surveying the room carefully, you 
notice that there is no ceiling above, and the only other exit besides the 
one you entered through is through a greasy trapdoor above.

The Magenta stripe on the wall glows faintly and you notice a little Magenta Sign.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Syntax: cast 'barkskin' <target>
Spell Number: 139

Drawing upon their affinity to nature, the ranger is able to imbue the skin
of a target with the strength and durability of bark, thus improving
physical resistances for the duration of the spell.

Syntax: cast 'earth maw' <victim>
Damage: earth
Spell Number: 380

One of the first ways in which a Ranger can call upon nature to aid him,
the Earth Maw invocation imbues the living rock with a primitive, aggressive
sentience, causing a maw filled with sharp spikes to strike forcefully at
the foe.  This spell can only be used against one opponent at a time.

This skill is automatic.

The camouflage skill allows a ranger to blend in with local surroundings
and confuse an opponent into missing completely. 

Only primary-class rangers are taught the best ways of using camouflage,
and are then able to use it to full ability through their entire tier.
Characters which remort into ranger class from another will see less benefit
from this skill.

A field of mulberry trees
  Rows after rows of mulberry trees grow in this field. The trees are nearly
thirty feet tall. A special ladder which Murray probably uses to pick the berries
is stored near the field.  The ripe berries on most of the trees are 
mostly black. You see a few trees with either red or white berries. If you 
moved the leaves in the closest tree you might be able to climb it. A few 
patches in the front corners of the field yield various other crops, probably
for Murray's own use.

  Some goats and chickens mill around in the fenced-in farm yard. The chickens 
carefully avoid you, but the goats don't seem to be fearful. Assorted farm 
machinery and tools are stored around the edges of the yard. A couple of

illegal. That law was struck down after the former Captain's death in the 
earthquake. No one has rushed to start up the parlor again although it was 
rebuilt in Anastasia's bar and restaurant. The town has been too busy getting
re-established for such a frivolous task. It is dusty and full of cobwebs and
rodents.

A tall tree
  A tall hickory tree grows in this corner of the park. Its lower branches 
droop close to the ground making a cool, shady place to escape the heat of 
summer. You see a few squirrels and many birds in the upper branches of the 
tree. The squirrels likely hoard all the hickory nuts they can get their paws
on. This tree is probably a blessing for the farmers for keeping squirrels 
away from them.

occasional squirrel scrambling up the trunk waving its tail at you. To the

Old Gambling Parlor
  This used to be a very popular and busy gambling parlor. But the previous 
Captain of the Guard lost big here once and thereafter declared gambling 
illegal. That law was struck down after the former Captain's death in the 
earthquake. No one has rushed to start up the parlor again although it was 
rebuilt in Anastasia's bar and restaurant. The town has been too busy getting
re-established for such a frivolous task. It is dusty and full of cobwebs and
rodents.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

progress more difficult. The path actually sinks into the ground as if the

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  You have stumbled upon a gaping sulfur pit.  Strangely, it is a sweetish
sulfur, almost like candy.  You feel a curious mixture of revulsion and
appetite.  This strengthens your sense that these catacombs are drenched in
strange spells that have rendered once innocent materials of Andolar most
unusual.  

[ Exits: south ]
Mottled patches of pink and green crawl toward you.
A ghoulish zombie pup tries to act cute and loveable.

Fork
  You have come to yet another fork in the catacombs.  The path west looks
more promising.  Although it is very dark here, you occasionally catch sight
of strange blue or green luminous shapes.  You also catch the scent of
unusual gasses.  Is this why the dwarves have abandoned this place?

Another Turn
  The soft glow of the rock here allows you to discern a passage north. 
You are increasingly convinced that some clan of dwarves once worked these
catacombs, as evidence of their craftsmanship accumulates.  Still, they seem
long gone from these parts and their tunnels are crumbling.

  You find yourself on a ledge cut into the blue rock of the chasm.  The
quality of the cut suggests dwarven craftsmanship.  Did the dwarves, in
their endless tunneling for treasure, inadvertently rupture one of the chasm
walls?  Were they cursed, even doomed, for such importunity?  In any case,
they seem to have tried to conceal their transgression with a slick and
subtle dwarven door.  Stairs lead downward and you feel a desire to explore.

Fantasizing
  Closing your eyes, you feel yourself being transported into a new world,
one of fantasies both good and bad.  The Fantasy Fields stretch in many
directions, encompassing visions of delight and horror.  Where you stand,
the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

your imagination.  After all, it was your own imagination that created this
place, wasn't it?  You hear scratching from under your bed.  On second

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  This is a small stand off of the road.  There is no longer anything for
sale here, just a loose structure that was once a thriving shop.  Now the
occasional bum stops here for a rest out of the weather.  

  The faint sounds of music echo everywhere within this stall.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Many travelers in Aardwolf find themselves fatigued, trapped between two
distant points on our world. To speed recovery, a caster may use the
'refresh' spell to restore move points and continue the journey.

If there is no target specified, the spell will be directed at the caster.

Syntax: cast dissolve <target>
Spell Number: 238

The dissolve spell is used as a cure for the restricted movement effect
of web.

The amount removed is based on the stats of the caster vs the strength of
the web spell. If a dissolve spell fails it still lowers the overall 
strength of the web affect, making subsequent casts more likely to succeed.

Note: Dissolve is less effective when used from a potion or other item.

This skill is automatic.

The camouflage skill allows a ranger to blend in with local surroundings
and confuse an opponent into missing completely. 

Only primary-class rangers are taught the best ways of using camouflage,
and are then able to use it to full ability through their entire tier.
Characters which remort into ranger class from another will see less benefit
from this skill.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Hallway in the Temple (G) (691)

Before a Black Ebony Door
  Sticking out like a sore thumb, a black ebony door stands in contrast
against the white marble walls of the church.  The door has no window and no
indication as to where it leads.  There is a bright, polished silver handle
on the right side that seems to pull outward.  Glancing about for a moment,
you do not see any restrictive signs suggesting that you cannot or should
not enter.

Entrance to the Garden Commune (691)

Corner of the Garden Commune (691)

Behind the Grassy Knoll (G)
  On the back side of a large, grassy hill there is a great, wooden door. 
The door seems to have no handle, no bell, and it is obvious from the hinges
that the door swings outward.  You find the idea of an unopenable door in
Ivar's Temple strangely alluring and mysterious.  How does one go about
entering into the doorway?  Perhaps there is someone waiting on the other
side?

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Approaching a Ruined Town
  The trail leads you to a long abandoned town -at least it was abandoned
before the wood elves moved in to occupy it.  Ancient structures stand built
with wood and stone, designed to last hundreds, if not thousands, of years. 
They're a testament to the greatness of their engineers.  As you look up,
however, you notice that the wood elves do not live in the stone houses
primarily.  Most find their homes up in the treetops.  Attuned with nature,
the wood elves feel at home here, their village comprised almost entirely
out of the trees and plants of the forest.

Castle Grounds
  The castle grounds are well taken care of.  Flowers in various stages of
bloom, and bushes hiding the cracked and damaged walls of the castle, are
all but a few of the features of this garden.  Large shrubberies are cut
into various shapes; elven runes and other symbols of power and immortality.
Several gardeners are present, putting in the many hours a garden of this
stature requires for its upkeep.

  As you approach the back of the gardens you come up to a large wooden
door, allowing you access into the castle.  The door is partly open allowing
various aromas of cooking meat, soups, and sauces to enter your nasal
passages.  Suddenly a cook comes out of the door and pours a pot of water on
the plants, ruining them.  One of the gardeners notices the act and gives
the chef a good talking too.  I doubt he'll do that again.

  All the sights and sounds that are associated with cooking are present
here in the castle kitchen.  Elven chefs move with unbelievable speed, a
speed that can only come through hundreds of years of practice with a knife
and food.  The heat is quite intense here, but you can see that each of the
elves wears a small blue charm around their necks, which cools the air
around their heads.  These elves have adapted magic for almost every use!

A fisherman says 'Care for a bit of fishing?  It's quite fun.  :D'

A fisherman says 'Of course, you'll have to buy some of my fishing cakes.  They are guaranteed to

An Old Town Road
  As the old road approaches the castle, you come across the two last stone
buildings in the village.  Unlike other parts of the town you hear a series
of loud cheers, cries, and laughter all at once.  Suddenly, a halfling
quickly runs out from the west shouting, "More gold for the bar!"  But
weaving as he does so.  He continues to the east, slamming into the bar's
wall.  Looks like he's had enough already.

  It appears that this section of road was made to be the center of the
marketplace for this town.  The road becomes very wide, almost circular to
allow vendors' carts to have access to the flow of people.  To the west you
see a fairly small stone home, with a large staff hanging over the door.  To
the east is a large blacksmith's shop, with many suits of armor hanging on
the stone supports.

An Old Town Road
  At first glance, the road in this part of the town seems to not have any
sort of buildings to lead you to.  You can just make out a path used by the
wood elves to the west and east of the road.  The forest stays undisturbed
as the elves pass; it seems to bend to make the way easier for its partners.
As you peer down each path large buildings become visible, and many elves
can be seen entering and leaving.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.
