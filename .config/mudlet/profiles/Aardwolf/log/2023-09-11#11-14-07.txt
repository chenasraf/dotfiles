WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  This used to be a completely normal place.  The city was a bustling
commerce point with many tourists visiting every day.  Then one day the
magic came and the world changed forever.  Now nothing is the same as it
used to be.  There's just something not right about the region now.  The
locals have a new nickname for the region now; they call it 'A Magical
Hodgepodge'.

Approaching the Camp
  To the northeast, the snow-shrouded bulk of the long dormant volcano
dominates the horizon.  Even at this distance, the fearsome winds of the
upper slopes are made visible through the wisps of snow streaming from the
peak.  There are two constants in this frozen wasteland - the terrible cold,
so intense it easily penetrates clothing, flesh, sinew and bone, and the
wintry landscape, a pallid white as far as the eye can see.  Here and there
a skeletal tree, branches encased in ice, provides some small respite from
the dreary continuity.  A wide swath of snow has been tramped down by the
passing of dozens of booted feet.  It leads off to the east where a camp of
some sort can be seen, a trickle of rising smoke giving evidence of
habitation.

The Human Refugee Camp (678)

At the Foot of the Volcano
  Here at the foot of the looming volcano, no wind blows, no animal calls
out and an eerie quiet abides.  Scraggly bushes, half buried in the deep
snow, provide shelter for the snowshoe rabbits which frequent this area.  A
small snare rests nearby, presently empty and unsprung.  A trail of boot
prints enters from the camp to the south and then turns east toward the
volcano's slopes.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

Dark and forgotten
  
You drop lightly onto possibly the most filthy floor you've ever seen. The 
only illumination comes from your own light source, but it clearly outlines 
the many bones littering the tiny room. Surveying the room carefully, you 
notice that there is no ceiling above, and the only other exit besides the 
one you entered through is through a greasy trapdoor above.

The Magenta stripe on the wall glows faintly and you notice a little Magenta Sign.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the

The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

  You find yourself at the western end of the boardwalk, where a large
brick wall directs you either north or south.  Looking south, you see the
area known as Pristine Beach, a gorgeous setting that is the pride of

  Stepping through a small opening in the woodline, you find yourself
standing on the outer edge of what looks like a huge battlefield.  Your
mouth drops and you stare at the scene before you.  Chairs, tables, brooms,
and various other household items are fighting against animals!  How can
this be, though?  Furniture does not move and it certainly does not fight,
and even stranger is that the animals seem to be working together and using
makeshift weapons!

On the battlefield
  This section of the field is a scene of carnage, strewn with animal
corpses, body parts, and gore.  The furniture seems to be raging over the
poor soft-fleshed creatures of the woodlands.  To the west, however, you can
see a large buildup of animals massing for a counter attack.

On the battlefield
  The ground here is completely torn up.  Whatever happened must have been
a very destructive force to move this amount of earth, probably caused by
magic from one of the wizards.  You can plainly see a laid stone foundation
under the dirt here, and it appears to extend off in all directions under
the dirt.  Maybe this whole area used to be some other building.  You will
have to ponder this strange stone floor later, however; right now you need
to avoid being injured by the nearby combatants.

feet in width. Smooth rocks protrude up from the earth in many spots, making 
progress more difficult. The path actually sinks into the ground as if the 
dirt had simply been worn away. A few trees dot the horizon to the east and 
west. To the north, you see a series of tents.

Armor Tent
  As you enter this tent, you notice pieces of leather everywhere. Upon closer 
inspection, it is apparent that the shop is bursting with a large assortment 
of armor that has been adorned with a variety of crests and symbols. Every 
item sold in this establishment conforms with the basic standards of quality 
and performance required by the instructors at this camp. Each piece of armor
has been arranged meticulously. The northern wall of the tent has a rack of 
breastplates; the southern wall has helmets of all shapes, sizes, and styles.
Other armor pieces such as shields, bracers, and gauntlets are aligned on 
tables throughout the tent. The eastern wall sports anatomical diagrams for 
most races, indicating suggested body locations for the optimal use of armor.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  A brightly colored sign magically flashes on and off, proclaiming BIG
BUCKS!  BIG BUCKS!   and casting a dingy yellow haze through the
smoke-filled room.  Looking about, you see citizens from throughout the
realm tightly clutching small scraps of precious paper.  Or so they hope. 
Glancing around the room, you see discarded losing lottery tickets covering
the floor and tossed haphazardly on tabletops. 
 
Suddenly a *shriek* of pleasure fills the air as yet another winner matches 
numbers and strikes it rich!  You wonder how you can take part in this!  
From out of nowhere, a gentle voice whispers, "Read 'Help Lottery'."

The Aardwolf lottery is a bi-weekly drawing in which players can buy
tickets at a chance for large gold prizes, much like a state or national
lottery you might have in real life.

Each ticket has three numbers, each ranged from 1 to 50.  Each ticket
costs 10,000 gold, and you cannot buy more than 100 tickets per draw.  
There is a game maximum of 40,000 tickets sold for each drawing, so the 
limit per person ensures that each player gets a chance.

To buy a lottery ticket, go to the lottery store in Aylor, which is located
on the far east end of Grandmarket Boulevard.  When in that store, you can
buy a ticket via the following options:

  buy ticket <num1> <num2> <num3>  : Buys a ticket with specific numbers.
  buy ticket random                : Buys 1 ticket with random numbers.
  buy ticket all                   : Buys up to limit of random tickets.

When you buy tickets, you do not actually receive ticket items.  Tickets
are saved on your player file and carry with you across renames, remorts,
tiers, etc. (but not recreates/deletions).  There is no extra step required
to 'enter' them into the drawing; this happens automatically.  Tickets are
not transferable.

If you have purchased tickets for the current drawing, typing 'lottery 
tickets' will display a list of your ticket numbers, up until the time of
the drawing.


Prizes

The prize funds are based on the number of tickets sold.  The minimum a
jackpot can be worth is 20,000,000 gold, with a secondary prize fund of at
least 8,000,000 gold.  If there are no jackpot winners in a draw, the 
prize fund will be added to the next draw for a massive 'rollover' 
jackpot.  The total prize fund will always be 90% of the income received 
from tickets, with the remaining 10% going to various charities that will 
generally involve things like a nice new mansion for Ivar or his sister 
Ravi.

Prizes for the next drawing (plus the time of that drawing) are always
viewable by typing 'lottery prizes'.


Drawings

Drawings occur twice a week, at 6 p.m. Eastern ('real life') Time on
Wednesdays and Saturdays.  You do not need to be online at the time of the
drawing.

Anyone with all three numbers the same (in any order) wins a share of the
jackpot pool.  Anyone with two of the three numbers the same will win a
share of the secondary prize pool.  (Because the tickets only check for the
numbers, not the order, there may be more than one jackpot winner and many
people sharing the secondary prize pool.)  The winning numbers and players
will be posted on the Lottery board.  Winners will also be notified at the
time of the drawing, or upon next login if they are offline.

Use 'lottery collect' to collect any winnings.  You will see the date of
the drawing, the numbers you had, the winning numbers, and your winnings,
per ticket and total (if more than one ticket won a prize).

Winners have 30 days to collect their prizes.

There are also two videos which shows lottery help on Aardwolf:

Rocky Cliff (G) (739)

Southern Path
  The trail has changed to mostly dirt and sod, now bordered by large, leafy 
trees. The woods on the western side have grown close together, giving a dark
atmosphere. The path meanders on its way to a charming little lake, both 
partially shaded. The water is a clear blue, the surface reflecting milky 
white clouds and blue skies. To the east, the ground is raised and very 
rocky, looking to be a hard climb.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

A Hallway in the Temple (G) (743)

Before a Black Ebony Door
  Sticking out like a sore thumb, a black ebony door stands in contrast
against the white marble walls of the church.  The door has no window and no
indication as to where it leads.  There is a bright, polished silver handle
on the right side that seems to pull outward.  Glancing about for a moment,
you do not see any restrictive signs suggesting that you cannot or should
not enter.

Corner of the Garden Commune (743)

Behind the Grassy Knoll (G)
  On the back side of a large, grassy hill there is a great, wooden door. 
The door seems to have no handle, no bell, and it is obvious from the hinges
that the door swings outward.  You find the idea of an unopenable door in
Ivar's Temple strangely alluring and mysterious.  How does one go about
entering into the doorway?  Perhaps there is someone waiting on the other
side?

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.

  This is a gloomy sort of intersection where the ground and the air both hold

Silvermist Road other than a large manor covered by a large, white tent.
Three massive cannons defend the front lawn, and a stable of warhorses sits 
off to the side. Funny, you think, how, with the grey of ash and the silver 
of mist, a war scene seems fitting. A massive chain dangles above you.

To the South the corridor continues past the Elevator, and to the North you 
see more of the corridor. There is the buzzing of distant conversation coming
from further South, while nothing catches your attention to the North.
Interestingly, the entire prison seems to be built around the elevator to the 
South with equidistant focal points North and South of it.

The elevator room
  
You can't help but notice the ornate elevator doors here. Encrusted with 
precious gems and gilded with purest gold, nothing could be more out of place
in a prison. A glowing magenta button winks steadily beside the doors. The 
Captain of the Guard divides his time between staring at the elevator doors, 
passing prisoners, and you. Obviously what ever is beyond those doors is 
important enough to keep an important official posted here as a precaution.

The captain of the guard watches the elevator button closely.
The captain of the guard says, "Hold on buster!  You can look around all
 you like down here, but don't even THINK about going upstairs. It's creepy
 up there, and the prisoners are much too dangerous to mingle with innocent
 pups like you."

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the

The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

Glancing around the room, you see discarded losing lottery tickets covering
the floor and tossed haphazardly on tabletops. 
 
Suddenly a *shriek* of pleasure fills the air as yet another winner matches 
numbers and strikes it rich!  You wonder how you can take part in this!  
From out of nowhere, a gentle voice whispers, "Read 'Help Lottery'."

in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door

is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

Slaver's Route, Before the Brothel
  The Slaver's Route, almost everyone in the Underdark has walked along
these famous stones.  It was along this road that the city was made. 
Without the slave trade, the city would not have expanded as fast as it did
when the city was first built.  The Underdark has since become a trade
centre where those who dwell beneath the ground and those above can
interact in relative safety.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

On the outskirts of a battlefield
  Stepping through a small opening in the woodline, you find yourself
standing on the outer edge of what looks like a huge battlefield.  Your
mouth drops and you stare at the scene before you.  Chairs, tables, brooms,
and various other household items are fighting against animals!  How can
this be, though?  Furniture does not move and it certainly does not fight,
and even stranger is that the animals seem to be working together and using
makeshift weapons!

a sigh of relief.  This place is as bad as Virgil's.  Both towers are on the
verge of collapse after so many months of constant battle.  You notice some
stairs here that seem to go both up and down, as well as collapsing hallways
leading off in all directions.  Unsure of which way to go, you place your
hand on the railing of the stairs and immediately draw it back.  Bird poop
covers this place, along with droppings of every other kind of animal that
has been in the immediate vicinity.

A destroyed hallway
  This section of hallway is less used than the others.  It extends farther
north but there is not much activity there, and there are no cracks or holes
here to allow light to filter in as with the other passages.  Probably the
lack of light discourages the animals from using it as much.  Either that or
the stench.  By the gods, this place is filthy!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  The smoothness of the tunnel walls has been destroyed.  Peering through
the inky blackness, one may detect an opening to the west, and a mound of
freshly dug earth to either side of it.  Mud bricks have been baked to
flinty hardness and laid to support the hole in the wall, preventing
collapse.  As one nears the opening, a little light can be glimpsed.

A Guard Outpost
  A rough tunnel has been burrowed through the dark brown earth, large
enough for even giants to pass through easily.  It'd be a lot easier if
there weren't a new iron-banded wooden gate in the way though.  The pair of
giant... holy cow, those are rabbits!  Six feet tall when they sit on their
haunches, they're also armed to the teeth.  And they're glaring at you.

with any army, the one preparing to invade the upper world encourages an
economy all its own, and the civilians make their living in support roles

  Market burrows line the tunnel. Although the area is well-lit, thieves and 
pickpockets thrive in this section of Terramire. Shoppers glance over their 
shoulders constantly, checking their shadows. There is a narrow ally to the 
east, but common sense tells one to avoid it. One cannot tell if a murderer 
or cut-throat lurks in such a place.

An Underground Market
  It's fairly busy in this part of the warrens, as rabbits come and go
about their daily business.  Young rabbits scamper along laughing and
playing tag, those a bit older swagger toward their favorite taverns, and
matrons bustle as they shop for groceries.  In addition to the lichen that
lights most of the fort, posts topped with torches have been added, lighting
the marketplace brilliantly.  There is almost no dark shadow for thieves and
pickpockets to abscond to with their ill-gotten gains.

The East Tunnel
  Here it is, the heart of the civilian portion of Fort Terramire.  As
with any army, the one preparing to invade the upper world encourages an
economy all its own, and the civilians make their living in support roles
and engaging in business with the military here.  The burrows are well-lit,
phosphorous lichen carefully cultivated along the paths.  They have to be
replaced now and then, for young rabbits love playing with them.

A Dark and Foreboding Corridor
  There is plenty of the glowing lichen lining the walls of this tunnel,
yet one might almost swear that less light exists here.  The peaceful babble
of the civilians to the east is starting to die out, overcome by the sounds
of clashing metal and shouting rabbits to the west.  Even the air seems to
be tinged with less pleasant odors- foul, metallic, acrid.

A Guarded Gate (G)
  The tunnel widens abruptly into a large cavern, but the cave has been
bisected by a wall of stone that stretches from north to south, the masonry
letting not even a mouse through.  Rabbit soldiers are stationed every few
yards along the grey barricade, as if a stone wall three feet thick weren't
enough to delay an invading force.  There is one point of entry- a narrow
wooden gate is placed right in the center of the wall, guarded by more elite
soldiers.  They dip their heads to listen to everyone who wishes to pass
between the military and civilian portions of the fort.

where the cavern had to be shored up with wooden columns.  The rabbit
cavalry works around these obstacles with a smooth synchronization that's a

Military Headquarters
  There must be some source of fresh air here, for the sour smells below
seem to quickly fade now.  The wood-bound walls are whitewashed, reflecting
the light from a series of lanterns hanging on sconces.  No earth floor for
the army command, oh, certainly not- a functional but soft carpet of dark
brown lines the floor, absorbing dirt, blood, and sound.  All in all, tis
the epitome of a professional military headquarters.

The Slave Pens

well as the south, however, to the east is the office in which you go to rent
slaves by the day. Even the civilians are allowed in this part of the 
military compound, however, this is the ONLY part they are allowed in. When a
civilian does enter, they are escorted to the slave pens, and are escorted 
out as well. With the slave pens being underground, it is rather dark and

Rent-A-Slave
  The large office is well lit by an orb that is suspended in the center of the
room about a foot below the ceiling. This room is very cold, being 
underground does not help that any. There is a tariff hanging on the wall 
listing the prices of renting the slaves. There are a few potted plants, but 
they look as fake as the smile Barnum wears when he is trying to talk his 
customers in renting more than one slave. There is a large desk that is 
cluttered with papers and it seems it would be impossible to find anything on
the desk. Behind the desk is a rather comfortable looking chair, one that 
definitely cost a pretty gold coin. There are no pictures on the wall, just 
the tariff hangs on the otherwise bare walls. Along the east wall is a filing
cabinet. Let's just hope it is in better order than Barnum's desk.

The Military Encampment
  From here, the military encampment of the rabbits sprawls across the
underground landscape.  Tunnels lead to both the officers' and enlisted
living areas, as well as to the supply compound.  Though this part of the
camp is perhaps not as obsessively kept up as the square to the south, it's
still policed daily to get rid of litter, and those rabbits caught
carelessly tossing aside debris face censure, fines, and, worst of all,
kitchen patrol.

A Clean Kitchen
  This is a fairly well-appointed kitchen.  Burnished pots and pans line
the earthen walls, alongside racks of ladles and butcher knives.  Fancy
foodstuffs are strewn along the countertops, and the chefs rush back and
forth between separate meals as they hurry to produce the meals demanded by
a half dozen officers or more all at once.

The Officers' Mess
  Less than half the size of the enlisted mess hall, this burrow has been 
fancied up for fine dining. There are actual tables here, in long rows and 
covered by pristine white and red checkered tablecloths. A spray of flowers 
at the center of each table is color-coordinated, providing a pleasant scent 
and eye candy at the same time. Kitchen workers in pressed uniforms take 
the officers' orders and silently deliver steaming, tasty dishes.

Fort Terramire Officer Quarters
  This is the Officer's part of the encampment. They each have burrows down the
hallway to the south. To the north lies the eating area and kitchen. A large 
desk sits in the middle of the room occupied by a pudgy female rabbit. There 
are large paintings on the walls and a few potted plants grow near the 
doorways.

The Military Encampment
  From here, the military encampment of the rabbits sprawls across the
underground landscape.  Tunnels lead to both the officers' and enlisted
living areas, as well as to the supply compound.  Though this part of the
camp is perhaps not as obsessively kept up as the square to the south, it's
still policed daily to get rid of litter, and those rabbits caught
carelessly tossing aside debris face censure, fines, and, worst of all,
kitchen patrol.

The Mess Cavern
  The babble in here is surprisingly quiet; mess halls tend to be rather
noisy.  But the prevalent sound here is crunching and chewing.  A buffet
table covered in various choices of grain- corn, wheat, rye- provides plenty
of fodder for the soldiers to choose from, and water has been hauled in from
the Fort's underground stream.  The rich aroma of grain combined with the
comfortable air of companionability makes for a relaxing dining spot.

To judge from the size of the pyramid of droppings that dominates the pit,
the fort has been in business for a long time.  Of course, the floor is
slimy, and the smell is just awful, but that helps ensure that soldiers on a

Soldier's Sleeping Quarters
  Depressions line the ground instead of beds. The soldiers line each 
depression with blankets in hopes to keep warm and have a softer place to 
sleep. Like drones, the soldiers are pushed too far and they tend to be on 
their last leg of sanity. Right where the army wants them. New recruits dream
of home and wish very much that they wouldn't have joined the army with an 
impending war. A soft sob rings through the room, although no rabbit speaks, 
each recruit knows how the other feels.

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  On top of this mountain you find a large, translucent crystal.  Any light

The Center of the Inner Sea
  You see a gigantic, translucent crystal rising from the water towards
the unseen ceiling far above you.  The crystal vibrates, and an inner
light makes the air and the water glow in faint rainbow colors.  A low
hum echoes over the black water, as the colors swirl within, forming an
odd pattern.
