Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

  You stand in a training field with wet and muddy grounds.
As you continue down the fields,you realize that 
this was once a battlefield of the worthy and ruthless
but it has now been swept and turned into a training
ground.
Apart from the worn paths and unpleasant pools of mud,
this field is still be used as a training center, and
an older man in a brown uniform who is as tough as
nails.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Military Surplus Store (G)
  You have entered a warehouse filled with military gear. Heaps of battered 
helmets and other miscellanea lay scattered randomly around the warehouse.
Dust covers much of it, tickling your nostrils, and making you want to 
sneeze. As you make your way down the ragtag aisles you finally stumble upon
the front desk. An old man with one eye stares at you. Better make it quick 
he doesn't seem to have much patience. Type list to view its wares.

help classchange
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Classchange.
Help Category : Utility.
Related Helps : Primary Class, Rebuild, Subclass.
Last Updated  : 2023-07-15 12:05:01.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:

  classchange <password> <subclass> <race>
  classchange <password> <subclass> <race> [options] 
  classchange check
  classchange cancel

Options:
 
  noinstinct: Don't reset instinct.
  nomastery : Don't reset mastery.
  sameclass : Confirm when using classchange to rebuild instinct/mastery.

Summary:

This command is used to change your primary class, rebuild instinct and
rebuild masteries. It can be used free of charge every 7 days or at any
time at a cost of 1000QPs.

There is an FAQ at the end of this help file for how to do specific 
things such as change masteries or your main class only.

Type 'classchange check' to check the cost of a classchange.
Type 'classchange cancel' to back-out of the class changing process.

Detail:

Below are some important extra details about classchanges

* If your password contains a space, you will need to put single 
  quotes around it when using the classchange command: 
    classchange '<password>' <subclass> <race>.

* If you want to rebuild mastery or instinct only, classchange into 
  the same class. 

* If you choose a class that you have not yet remorted into, your 
  old primary class is completely removed and you will no longer have 
  access to those skills/ spells until you remort back into your former 
  class. If you already have the changed class, they simply swap. The
  game will return some practices based on the skills you lose during the
  classchange.

* The first class change on your character is free; subsequent class 
  changes are free every 7 days or at a cost of 1000QP if you don't want
  to wait.

You must type the classchange command twice to confirm the changes. If 
you change your mind or make a mistake, you can use 'classchange 
cancel' to back out.

Automatic rebuild:

Because of the emphasis on different stats in each class, when changing to
a new primary class, your character will automatically have stats reset as 
if you had used the rebuild command. Stats will need to be re-trained, and 
any tier/wish stats will need to be set again. This works the same way as a 
regular rebuild and does count as your first rebuild in the game.

Practiced amount in skills is not reset except for when you are losing 
access to a skill because it is class/subclass only. The game will 
return some practices when this is the case.

Frequently Asked Questions:
---------------------------

* How do I classchange only, leaving instinct and mastery in place?

   Example: classchange [password] avenger elf nomastery noinstinct

* How do I rebuild only masteries or only instinct?

    classchange [password] [current class] [currentrace] sameclass

  If you only want to do instinct *or* mastery, add 'noinstinct' or 
  'nomastery' option to exclude the other.

  You may also use the old mastery and instinct commands at a cost of 
  500qp. Refer to those helpfiles for more details.

* How can I change subclass only?

  Keep all other options other than subclass the same as they already are 
  and add the 'sameclass' option. For example, if you are an elf paladin-
  avenger and want to become an elf paladin-guardian:

    classchange [password] guardian elf sameclass

  Remember to add noinstinct and nomastery if you really want to change
  *only* subclass.

* How can I use this to change race only?

  Keep all options other than race the same as they already are and add
  the 'sameclass' option. For example, if you are an elf paladin-avenger 
  and want to become a vampire paladin-avenger:

    classchange [password] avenger vampire sameclass

  Remember to add noinstinct and nomastery if you really want to change
  *only* race.

help solidify

Help Keywords : Solidify.
Help Category : Equipment.
Related Helps : Detect invis, Illuminate, Resonate, Disenchant.
Last Updated  : 2015-12-19 17:53:22.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax: cast 'solidify' <item>

High level mages and psionicists are able to manipulate the molecular
structure of items they are carrying to make them more compact. The result
of this spell is that items previously invisible can now be seen by the
average eye.

An extremely lucky caster has a small chance of adding hitroll or damroll
to the item they solidify.  Once this happens, the solidified flag is added
to the item and it is not possible to cast solidify upon it again.  Items
must be wearable in a specific position (e.g., 'take hold', 'take waist')
in order to receive stats from this spell.  Items with only 'Wearable:
take' will not receive stats from this spell.

Primary stat: Intelligence, Wisdom.
Affected by : Luck.

Last Updated  : 2017-06-20 18:48:14.

Syntax: cast illuminate <object>

Clerics and Paladins have the power to channel their peaceful thoughts and
good will into an object, causing it to give off a radiant glow.  This
allows it to cut through darkness with ease.  

An extremely lucky caster has a small chance of adding some of his/her
wisdom directly to the item they illuminate.  Once this happens, the
illuminated flag is added to the item and it is not possible to cast
illuminate upon it again.  Items must be wearable in a specific position
(e.g., 'take hold', 'take waist') in order to receive stats from this
spell.  Items with only 'Wearable: take' will not receive stats from this
spell.

Primary stat: Wisdom

Last Updated  : 2017-06-20 18:49:04.

Syntax: cast resonate <object>

Through the use of this Discipline, the psionicist is able to cause the
molecules within an object of his choice to vibrate. The resultant resonant
field makes the object easily detectable, even by touch alone.  This comes
in handy for those who have lost their sight.

An extremely lucky caster has a small chance of adding bonus luck to the
item they resonate.  Once this happens, the resonated flag is added to the
item and it is not possible to cast resonate upon it again.  Items must be
wearable in a specific position (e.g., 'take hold', 'take waist') in order
to receive stats from this spell.  Items with only 'Wearable: take' will
not receive stats from this spell.

help lore
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Lore.
Help Category : Equipment.
Related Helps : Identify, ObjectId.
Last Updated  : 2013-03-31 16:39:36.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax: lore <object>          : Gives info about target carried object.
        lore <wear-slot>       : Gives info about object worn on that
                                 location.
        lore <wear-slot> worn  : Used if wear slot name is the same as
                                 the keyword of a carried object e.g.
                                 'back' and 'backpack'.

Calling upon the power of your knowledge, the Lore skill will enable a 
character to discover many interesting things about an item.  Due to the 
resources required, the Lore skill can only be performed successfully in a
city, and costs a small amount of movement points to use.  Lore will reveal
many salient facts regarding the item, but there is also Hester in Aylor
who can perform a similar function, for a price- see 'help identify'.

Lore is not as effective as identify with weapons, but a person skilled in
lore can also determine the part of the realm an item came from.  You can
specify a wear slot (use 'wearable' to see a list of terms), to gather
information on the item worn in that slot.  For example, 'lore lwrist' will
show details of the item currently worn on your left wrist.

See 'help objectid' for more information on the Id field and see 'help
compare' for more information on the Score value shown in lore.

There is also a video which shows how to use the lore skill on Aardwolf:

  The room about you is tall, looming, and gives the impression of serious
and ponderous dignity...well, almost.  The trio of robins on the windowsill
gossiping about the Queen and her latest love...errr...tennis instructor,
and the pink, fuzzy bunny slippers peeking out from under a chair ruin the 
overall effect.  You wouldn't want to mention that to the guards, though,
dour-faced men ill at ease in the tabards the Queen designed (lavender with
silver ribbons).

  You've entered a garden unlike any you have ever seen.  Tropical flowers
nestle close to arctic roses, and all around fruit trees bloom, while
bearing ripe fruit on the same limb.  Small nooks hide marble fountains, and
beautiful statuary, mostly of handsome young men, adorn the walkways.  The
walkways themselves are lined with cool, white marble.

floor is bare except for a couple of small rugs.  A window looks out into
the forest, and the walls are covered with a brown cloth.  There are three

the walls and casting back a riot of color... green, red, white, yellow, purple,

  You stand before a small white cottage, obviously well-kept.  The roof
and window frames are painted a cheerful blue, and the walls are freshly
whitewashed.  Flowers bloom all around the house- roses, azaleas, irises and
daisies, creating a riot of color that dazzles the eye.  A fresh spring
breeze blows through the room.

In The Forest
{coords}0,42,34
{rdesc}
  The forest you walk through is not very well tended.  The trees, though
not very close together, are buried in underbrush, and the path is blocked
in places by branches.  The sky overhead is hidden by the leaves of the
trees that line the path.  Mysterious sounds come from the forest, as if
something evil were hidden there.

On the fringes of the Great Desert
  The lush plains of Hathzor spread all around you, but their verdant hues do 
nothing to soften the brutal truth that lies north. Rumours of the Great 
Desert have oft been heard, but nothing can compare to experiencing it: the 
northern border of the plain is in shadow, cloaked by a relentless storm of 
heat and sand. It has been said that only the desert ogres can travel that 
way and not risk death, but their ways are not your ways, certainly.


      A signpost of petrified sand is stuck in the ground.

Buried in the Great Desert's unrelenting dunes
  Pain was expected, but your unending days of travel through this barren hell 
are teaching you that you did not know pain before. Perpetual winds choke you
with sand and the air is always opaque with dust, but somehow the sun's heat 
pounds through. Although you had feared meeting the people of this Desert, 
any company would be a welcome respite from the searing monotony of the 
dunes. Slowly they spread, flowing, drifting.

  Pain was expected, but your unending days of travel through this barren hell 
are teaching you that you did not know pain before. Perpetual winds choke you
with sand and the air is always opaque with dust, but somehow the sun's heat 
pounds through. Although you had feared meeting the people of this Desert, 
any company would be a welcome respite from the searing monotony of the 
dunes. Slowly they spread, flowing, drifting.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered

On the fringes of the Great Desert
  The lush plains of Hathzor spread all around you, but their verdant hues do 
nothing to soften the brutal truth that lies north. Rumours of the Great 
Desert have oft been heard, but nothing can compare to experiencing it: the 
northern border of the plain is in shadow, cloaked by a relentless storm of 
heat and sand. It has been said that only the desert ogres can travel that 
way and not risk death, but their ways are not your ways, certainly.

  Pain was expected, but your unending days of travel through this barren hell 
are teaching you that you did not know pain before. Perpetual winds choke you
with sand and the air is always opaque with dust, but somehow the sun's heat 
pounds through. Although you had feared meeting the people of this Desert, 
any company would be a welcome respite from the searing monotony of the 
dunes. Slowly they spread, flowing, drifting.

On the fringes of the Great Desert
  The lush plains of Hathzor spread all around you, but their verdant hues do 
nothing to soften the brutal truth that lies north. Rumours of the Great 
Desert have oft been heard, but nothing can compare to experiencing it: the 
northern border of the plain is in shadow, cloaked by a relentless storm of 
heat and sand. It has been said that only the desert ogres can travel that 
way and not risk death, but their ways are not your ways, certainly.


      A signpost of petrified sand is stuck in the ground.

Entering an ogre village
  Finally the drought of the desert ends as you emerge on the far northwestern 
edge, finding yourself on the outskirts of an ogre trading settlement. As you
scan the village you notice an uneasy movement of the peoples, and closer 
examination reveals why: Sarcoph's conquering armies have already reached 
this remote place, gathering slaves and taxing trade. Strategically this 
provides little advantage, and surely the trade isn't that good. Why are they
here at all?

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.
