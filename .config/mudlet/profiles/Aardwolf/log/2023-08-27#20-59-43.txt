Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

East of the Aylorian Church Altar
  You stand on the east side of the altar in the grand Aylorian Church.  To
the north is a large wooden door that leads out to the Templar's Road of
Andolar.  To the east is a small nook with golden curtains cascading from
ceiling to floor.  A large mithril throne stands in the middle of the room
on which sits a man dressed head to toe in leather armor.  Women to his left
and right fawn over him, cooing and giggling like school girls.  

[ Exits: north east west ]
     Golden candlesticks holding several blood-red pillar candles trim the doorway.

  The road you have been walking on has become clouded up ahead. A thick 
choking fog has descended and envelops it and you as well. The air is 
choking heavy with the moisture and a sickeningly sweet smell. You can't 
quite place your finger on it. As you turn your head to look about, you find 
that the way back has become obscured. The only things you can make out 
clearly are the road under your feet and the soft glow of the light above
you...

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You are standing before a large building to the north. It appears to have 
been carefully constructed with large bricks and steel on the corners.
Perhaps the builders had in mind that this establishment must withstand some 
significant weather events. Occasionally, people rush by, heading towards the
building. The exits west, east and south head back to the continent of

paint. A beam above your head grabs your attention, due to a single nail 
sticking out about four inches. There are exits to the north and south.

  You have come upon one of the corners of this seemingly large clinic attic.
A couple of windows on the walls let a good amount of light in, illuminating 
the entire attic and making it very easy to navigate. The floor creaks

An intersection of hallways
  Two different hallways come to an intersection here. Due to the sufficient 
lighting, you can see nearly to the end of each hallway. A janitor or a 
doctor occasionally passes by, on their way to an unknown destination. The 
noises here are loud, since the intersection funnels them to this single 
point. The hallways continue in all directions. There is a small door in the 
floor beneath your feet, and a stairwell that leads upwards to the second 
floor of the clinic.

The administration area
  The administration area is where the staff handles the clerical duties of the
clinic. On the southern and western walls, you see two chalkboards hanging.
On them is a bunch of writing but none of it makes any sense to you. Some of 
it has been half-erased. An artificial plant also stands against the western 
wall. This area continues east and north.

Northeastern clinic basement
  Here is another corner of the basement. The lack of light around here makes 
it nearly impossible to see anything around the room. Occasionally, you feel 
something brush up against you, although you can't see what the being is. Is 
it possible the basement is actually haunted, or is that just your 
imagination running wild? Better find a light source and figure out what is 
going on. The clinic administration should be down here investigating.

  It is becoming obvious what or whoever created that portal never intended for
anyone to step through it. Perhaps it was created by accident, or for some 
beings to be able to easily enter the clinic. The owners of the clinic should
probably be notified of this event so they can attempt to close the portal.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Above the small bed to the north is a medium-sized window. It is fairly high 
off the ground, so looking out it would require one to stand on the bed. The 
window was obviously added just to let natural light in and not for patients 
to be able to look outside. The only exit is to the south.

their tools while not in use. There are mops, buckets and toolbelts thrown 
across the room, and countless boxes that have not been labled are stacked

ventured their way into this closet. The only exit is through the doorway to 
the west.

  The foyer of this patient room is a bit darker than the others. Perhaps the 
patients staying here are asleep, or maybe they just prefer the lighting to 
be dimmed. There is, however, enough light provided to see your way around 
the room. The patient room lies to the south, and the doorway to the north

Patient Room 4
  Upon entering the room, the smell of something foul hits you smack in the 
face. You're not sure of the source of this odor, nor are you intent on 
investigating. Perhaps it is time to notify the personnel of the clinic this 
room needs some attention. The only exit is to the north.

Syntax: fill <container> (<drink source>)
        pour <container> 

By itself, 'fill <container>' will refill a drink container with the first
in-room liquid source available (a fountain, barrel, pitcher, etc.).  If
the drink container in your inventory is not completely empty, you can
create a cocktail mix by filling it with a different liquid type. You may
also use 'fill <container> <source>' to fill from a specific source when
there is more than one in the room.

To empty a container, either 'pour <container>' or 'empty <container>'.

There is also a video which shows how to manipulate drink containers on 
Aardwolf:

patients here must like to draw to pass the time, and hang them up for others
to see. It provides a happier feeling to the room, and takes their mind off

Entering the second level
  You have entered the second level of the clinic. This level houses the 
patients who are recovering and need a place to stay while their medications 
take affect and their wounds heal. You see the occasional nurse walk by, 
checking on them to make sure they don't need anything. A hallway stretches 
east and west and two doors lie to the north and south. The doors have a 
small sign labeled "Restrooms". There's also a stairwell here leading down to

sound waves bounce through the halls. There's an intersection of hallways to 
the east, and this hallway continues to the west.

>>    An intersection of hallways
  Two different hallways come to an intersection here. Due to the sufficient 
lighting, you can see nearly to the end of each hallway. A janitor or a 
doctor occasionally passes by, on their way to an unknown destination. The 
noises here are loud, since the intersection funnels them to this single 
point. The hallways continue in all directions. There is a small door in the 
floor beneath your feet, and a stairwell that leads upwards to the second 
floor of the clinic.

[ Exits: north east south west up (down) ]
     (Magic) A first floor directory has been posted on the wall.

A bright hallway
  This bright hallway continues north and south. The lighting here seems even 
brighter than in the rest of the clinic hallways. You assume it is kept so 
well lit here to enable the janitors to spot unclean areas and for easy 
access to the various rooms of the clinic. To the north is an intersection 
and this hallway continues to the south.

  The bright hallway that runs north and south comes to an end here. Against 
the southern wall stands some sort of machine. You are unsure of its 
function, but your conscience tells you it probably shouldn't be messed with.

small sign stating "Private".

>>    The janitor's closet
  This is a very cramped closet that the janitors of the clinic use to store 
their tools while not in use. There are mops, buckets and toolbelts thrown 
across the room, and countless boxes that have not been labled are stacked 
against the wall. The janitors would likely be upset if they knew someone 
ventured their way into this closet. The only exit is through the doorway to 
the west.

A hidden lab
  You cringe in terror and anger at the sight of what you see in this room.
There are four cages in the room, each holding a different animal. They are 
chained inside of the cages to ensure they will never escape. You notice some
have a few abnormalities from being experimented on. It is now apparent the 
clinic uses this area to conduct experiments on animals before using them on 
patients.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Syntax: goals                         : List all non-hidden goals.
        goals <goal/search text>      : Lists information for given goal.

Many areas have goals.  These goals are made up of several steps, or tasks;
these tasks can vary from simply giving a response to
finding a particular item to killing multiple enemies of the task-giver.
Often times, goals include small rewards as you progress as well as special
bonuses for completing the entire goal.

Type 'goals' by itself to see a list of all goals.  'goals <goal name>' will
give more information on the specific goal, and 'goals here' will give goal
information on the current area.  'goals <search text>' lists all goals
with the given search text in the goal name or description.

Several other options can also be combined with 'goals' searches:

  <level range> : Lists all goals from minimum level to optional max level.
  new           : Lists goals you have not started.
  open          : Lists all goals you have started.
  notdone       : Lists goals that you have not completed.
  completed     : Lists all goals you have completed.
  byname        : Sorts goal output alphabetically rather than by level.
  byrating      : Sorts goals by difficulty rating instead of level.

These options may be combined, e.g., 'goals 15 50 new hero' or 'goals 150
open byrating'.

'goals stats' displays how many players have started and completed each
listed goal.  You may use the sort options 'bytaken' and 'bydone' (as well
as normal sort options) to change how these results are displayed.

Immortals may see a player's goal listing by typing 'goals <playername>'.


Goals generally have several tasks as part of their completion progress.
See 'help tasks' for more information on how to see these tasks. See 'help
goal solving' for general advice on solving goals, and 'help <goal name>'
for some additional information on the area and its task.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  You stand on the east side of the altar in the grand Aylorian Church.  To

Andolar.  To the east is a small nook with golden curtains cascading from
ceiling to floor.  A large mithril throne stands in the middle of the room
on which sits a man dressed head to toe in leather armor.  Women to his left

Misty Border
  The road you have been walking on has become clouded up ahead. A thick 
choking fog has descended and envelops it and you as well. The air is 
choking heavy with the moisture and a sickeningly sweet smell. You can't 
quite place your finger on it. As you turn your head to look about, you find 
that the way back has become obscured. The only things you can make out 
clearly are the road under your feet and the soft glow of the light above
you...

Fork in the Path
  The mist has begun to lift, letting you see how far you have travelled.
Either you are wearing seven league boots, or you have been in a daze, 
because the countryside that you can see through the mist does not appear the
same as that which you left. It is growing cold. You had best seek shelter 
soon. To the east, a country road appears to meander through farmers' fields.
To the north, the path rises gently upwards.

A Road through the Fields
  The road passes through fertile farmlands to the north and south. The route 
itself is in good repair, but for some minor ruts caused by heavily laden 
wagons heading towards the populated parts of the region. Once in a while you
pass other travelers, who, for the most part, are heading east.

A Road through the Forest
  The wheat fields are mostly behind you, and ahead, the road continues.
Overhead, crows caw with delight - they appear to be anxious to attack the 
wheat for the seeds. Scarecrows are needed, but none are seen. It is rather 
surprising that not a soul can be seen in the fields, monitoring the growth 
and shooing the crows away.

wood, cleverly linked at the corners by a sort of key- lock arrangement. The 
roofs are made of shiny tin, and are steeply sloping. A few have dormer 
windows from which the hausfraus peer, watching the world go by.

  The moaning emanating from the dungeon is faint but discernible despite the 
continuous sound of marching soldiers. It might be worthwhile exploring the 
dungeon below, to see what horrors might be perpetrated there.

  Yet another contingent of soldiers! These men are by no means up to your 
caliber. The Tzar must be training them for something. Perhaps to start a war
with the others? By the size of his castle and the developing army, he seems 
to stand a good chance to succeed.

  The stones of this hallway are no longer the drab gray. They have become a
dark red, the color of blood that has been spilled over and over again in
the same spot.

  You are at the farthest end of the bridge over the moat. On each side, there 
is a sentry post. However, despite this evidence of defensiveness, the gates 
to the castle are open. These must be times of peace indeed.

  You stand on one side of a bridge that crosses the moat of the castle. At the
farther end of the bridge, you spot a pair of sentry posts. Beyond this, the 
castle proudly stands. Upon the turrets fly colorful flags which are 
emblazoned with a mighty stallion rampant.

  The road begins to narrow here as it approaches the castle. There's a stream 
running here, likely engineered to fill the castle's moat. Across the stream,
a small herd of horses graze.

  Here the road leading north and south crosses with one leading east and west.
In each but the southerly direction, the road ends with castle gates. The 
rolling hills are low enough that you can make out each castle clearly. It is
hard to tell how distant each is, but given the quality of the road, it might
be less than a few hours walk to each.

  The cold stone of the hallway seems to mock you, each stone cut in the shape 
of the beheaded heads of enemies past. This Tzar seems to be the most 
barbaric of the region and one to be feared.

  Yet another contingent of soldiers! These men are by no means up to your 
caliber. The Tzar must be training them for something. Perhaps to start a war
with the others? By the size of his castle and the developing army, he seems 
to stand a good chance to succeed.

 be fooled long enough to give you the horse.  Come back to me, with the
 horse, and we will wait for Yuli to escape."

Elena the wolf starts to follow you.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

[ Exits: east south west ]

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Before Castle Levitus
  To the north, the swirling clouds part somewhat to reveal a structure of
immense proportions rising from a jagged island of solid rock which hangs
suspended by some mystical force.  Imposing stone walls, jet black in hue,
are topped by numerous crenellated towers.  One in particular overshadows
the rest, its lofty height dwarfing its peers.  The pinnacle of the great
tower is obscured by a mist which seems to pulse and coagulate as if with a
life of its own.  Intermittent glimmers of light slip from within the dark
fortress merely serving to cast the grim stonework into deeper shadow.

  A dank chill permeates the air, cutting through clothing.  The occasional
gust of wind keeps the mist flowing constantly about the wilted trees and
reeds.  The ground under foot is muddy and water-logged, making passage a
wearisome task for any passing this way.  Occasionally a fleeting form may
be glimpsed in the banks of fog, only to vanish from sight as quickly as it

  A dank chill permeates the air, cutting through clothing.  The occasional
gust of wind keeps the mist flowing constantly about the wilted trees and
reeds.  The ground under foot is muddy and water-logged, making passage a
wearisome task for any passing this way.  Occasionally a fleeting form may
be glimpsed in the banks of fog, only to vanish from sight as quickly as it
appeared.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  The dirt path leads you to a cattle farm.  It is quite small, as it seems
to only have a one or two room cabin, and a small shed that holds about 6
cows.  A lone woman stands in the field, watching her cows and slowly
herding them into the shed to be milked.

Sarah's Farm
  The dirt path leads you to a cattle farm.  It is quite small, as it seems
to only have a one or two room cabin, and a small shed that holds about 6
cows.  A lone woman stands in the field, watching her cows and slowly
herding them into the shed to be milked.

  After lowering yourself down the well for what seems to be an eternity,
you finally reach the bottom of the well.  As you let go of the rope and
land on the well floor, you can see that Sarah was right, the well is bone
dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the
well.  Perhaps these are where the water came from.  To the east, is a small
boulder, which appears to be blocking the way of a rather large hole.

Searching The Caverns... [**> PK <**]
  Dank and dark are these caves. You notice that water sheets down the wall in 
some areas of this cave, giving the cavern an almost mirror-like surface. As 
you venture forward, you come across a corpse of a Elf, hacked to bits and 
half eaten by the insects that inhabit the caverns. Perhaps this would be a 
good time to find your way out of here...

A Dead End...
  As you continue to follow one of the caverns, it brings you to a rather large
circular room. Torches provide the only light in this room, and you notice 
that there are rather large claw marks left in the floor.

great blow, the beast cleaves the elf in two, and a great cheer rises up
from the dark elves.  The dark elves then go back to betting on how long the
next victim will last.

when I looked down I saw some robed people carrying him through a doorway 
behind a large boulder!" 

Sarah exclaims, "I tried to follow them, but the doorway closed before I could 
go any farther, and the noises I heard beyond the door frightened me!" 

Sarah says, "I need you to go in there, rescue Thalien, and see what those 
robed people are doing." 

Sarah says, "He might be too scared to believe you, so if you give him the 
flowers in the well, then he will know that you are on his side."

A Stone Staircase
  In a small hall just off from the worship area, you find a small stone 
staircase. Just like the rest of the temple, the stairs are well crafted and 
have intricate designs carved into them. The stairs lead up, to what appears 
to be the roof.

A Stone Staircase
  The top of the staircase brings you up to a very small room, with a lone
door to the north.  It appears that this is the way that the monks get to
the roof to keep the cathedral in repair.

the barracks, the slaughterhouse, the mess hall, kitchen and the animal pen.
The only direction to go is to the west, as the south exit is blocked by the

It depicts a picture of a man, summoning a large daemon, covered with
flames.  As you continue looking at it, you can see small hinges on parts of
the glass, possibly to gain access to repair the window if it cracks.

It appears to have been added after construction of the temple, as it is in 
stark contrast with the quality of work used to create the temple. Most of 
the wood is aged and rotting, and has been patched over again and again with 
fresh planks of wood.

  The bell that once had a home here no longer hangs here, as the poorly 
constructed girder and frayed ropes used by the army have snapped under the 
weight of the bell some time ago. When the bell fell, it took out most of the
tower, and the monks attempted to repair the damage by placing wooden planks 
down randomly. As the wind picks up, the tower starts to rock slightly, 
giving you quite an uneasy feeling...

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

the stone. The tunnel leads to the south. As you peer down the tunnel, you 
can just barely make out sounds of screaming, and the light of torches. It 
appears that you might be able to squeeze though.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

A Small Well... (2071)

At The Bottom Of The Well
  After lowering yourself down the well for what seems to be an eternity,
you finally reach the bottom of the well.  As you let go of the rope and
land on the well floor, you can see that Sarah was right, the well is bone
dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the
well.  Perhaps these are where the water came from.  To the east, is a small
boulder, which appears to be blocking the way of a rather large hole.

  As you step through the door, you suddenly find yourself standing on a
steel grating that is suspended a good 20 feet above what appears to be a
pit.  As you peer around the room you find several dark elves leaning over
the railing watching a large beast dismember an unfortunate elf.  With one
great blow, the beast cleaves the elf in two, and a great cheer rises up
from the dark elves.  The dark elves then go back to betting on how long the
next victim will last.

  Down in the pit, the stench of rotting flesh, blood, and digestive fluids is 
almost too much to bear. You can hear chants from above: "50 gold on the 
N'Kari!" and "A victory over the N'Kari pays 10 to one!". Looks like the dark
elves don't have much confidence in your skills. It's a shame that you didn't
place a wager on yourself before coming down to fight the beast.

The Lair of the N'Kari
  Down in the pit, the stench of rotting flesh, blood, and digestive fluids is 
almost too much to bear. You can hear chants from above: "50 gold on the 
N'Kari!" and "A victory over the N'Kari pays 10 to one!". Looks like the dark
elves don't have much confidence in your skills. It's a shame that you didn't
place a wager on yourself before coming down to fight the beast.

go any farther, and the noises I heard beyond the door frightened me!" 

Sarah says, "I need you to go in there, rescue Thalien, and see what those

The N'Kari Pit
  As you step through the door, you suddenly find yourself standing on a
steel grating that is suspended a good 20 feet above what appears to be a
pit.  As you peer around the room you find several dark elves leaning over
the railing watching a large beast dismember an unfortunate elf.  With one
great blow, the beast cleaves the elf in two, and a great cheer rises up
from the dark elves.  The dark elves then go back to betting on how long the
next victim will last.

A Narrow Tunnel
  As you go through the small opening, you find a very small tunnel carved into
the stone. The tunnel leads to the south. As you peer down the tunnel, you 
can just barely make out sounds of screaming, and the light of torches. It 
appears that you might be able to squeeze though.

  Dank and dark are these caves. You notice that water sheets down the wall in 
some areas of this cave, giving the cavern an almost mirror-like surface. As 
you venture forward, you come across a corpse of a Elf, hacked to bits and 
half eaten by the insects that inhabit the caverns. Perhaps this would be a 
good time to find your way out of here...

At The Bottom Of The Well
  After lowering yourself down the well for what seems to be an eternity,
you finally reach the bottom of the well.  As you let go of the rope and
land on the well floor, you can see that Sarah was right, the well is bone
dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the
well.  Perhaps these are where the water came from.  To the east, is a small
boulder, which appears to be blocking the way of a rather large hole.  

[ Exits: east up ]
A centipede is crawling along the floor, looking for its next meal.

pit.  As you peer around the room you find several dark elves leaning over
the railing watching a large beast dismember an unfortunate elf.  With one
great blow, the beast cleaves the elf in two, and a great cheer rises up
from the dark elves.  The dark elves then go back to betting on how long the
next victim will last.

Task 1  : Where Is Thalien?

Sarah exclaims, "Shortly after he went into the well, I heard him yell, and 
when I looked down I saw some robed people carrying him through a doorway 
behind a large boulder!" 

Sarah exclaims, "I tried to follow them, but the doorway closed before I could 
go any farther, and the noises I heard beyond the door frightened me!" 

Sarah says, "I need you to go in there, rescue Thalien, and see what those 
robed people are doing." 

Sarah says, "He might be too scared to believe you, so if you give him the 
flowers in the well, then he will know that you are on his side."

Syntax: rescue <target>

Amidst the fury of battle, you turn and find your comrade struggling under
the onslaught! Rather than allow them to be severely beaten, you jump between
your friend and their foe, rescuing them from further harm.

Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as well as a comparison of
level, dexterity, and speed between the character and the target. (Note- you
rescue a friend, not the monster.)

Primary stat: Dexterity

A Narrow Tunnel
  As you go through the small opening, you find a very small tunnel carved into
the stone. The tunnel leads to the south. As you peer down the tunnel, you 
can just barely make out sounds of screaming, and the light of torches. It 
appears that you might be able to squeeze though.

Searching the Caverns... [**> PK <**]
  Dank and dark are these caves. You notice that water sheets down the wall in 
some areas of this cave, giving the cavern an almost mirror-like surface. As 
you venture forward, you come across a corpse of a Elf, hacked to bits and 
half eaten by the insects that inhabit the caverns. Perhaps this would be a 
good time to find your way out of here...

(White Aura) A Trapdoor Spider lies here in wait.
A centipede is crawling along the floor, looking for its next meal.

A Small Well...
  To the rear of the farm lies a small well.  It is in obvious disrepair,
the rope to the bucket frayed, the masonry crumbling, and the bucket having a
small hole in its side.  To the side of the well are a couple large
wheelbarrows, which contain water pulled from the well.

At The Bottom Of The Well
  After lowering yourself down the well for what seems to be an eternity,
you finally reach the bottom of the well.  As you let go of the rope and
land on the well floor, you can see that Sarah was right, the well is bone
dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the
well.  Perhaps these are where the water came from.  To the east, is a small
boulder, which appears to be blocking the way of a rather large hole.

The N'Kari Pit
  As you step through the door, you suddenly find yourself standing on a
steel grating that is suspended a good 20 feet above what appears to be a
pit.  As you peer around the room you find several dark elves leaning over
the railing watching a large beast dismember an unfortunate elf.  With one
great blow, the beast cleaves the elf in two, and a great cheer rises up
from the dark elves.  The dark elves then go back to betting on how long the
next victim will last.

  As you climb out of the tunnel, you see a rather large castle, carved almost 
entirely of the stone that makes up these caverns. There are large stone 
pillars, and fountains that are filled with what appears to be blood.

  As you step through the door, you suddenly find yourself standing on a
steel grating that is suspended a good 20 feet above what appears to be a
pit.  As you peer around the room you find several dark elves leaning over
the railing watching a large beast dismember an unfortunate elf.  With one
great blow, the beast cleaves the elf in two, and a great cheer rises up
from the dark elves.  The dark elves then go back to betting on how long the
next victim will last.

The Lair of the N'Kari
  Down in the pit, the stench of rotting flesh, blood, and digestive fluids is 
almost too much to bear. You can hear chants from above: "50 gold on the 
N'Kari!" and "A victory over the N'Kari pays 10 to one!". Looks like the dark
elves don't have much confidence in your skills. It's a shame that you didn't
place a wager on yourself before coming down to fight the beast.

when I looked down I saw some robed people carrying him through a doorway 
behind a large boulder!" 

Sarah exclaims, "I tried to follow them, but the doorway closed before I could 
go any farther, and the noises I heard beyond the door frightened me!" 

Sarah says, "I need you to go in there, rescue Thalien, and see what those 
robed people are doing." 

Sarah says, "He might be too scared to believe you, so if you give him the 
flowers in the well, then he will know that you are on his side."

The N'Kari Pit
  As you step through the door, you suddenly find yourself standing on a
steel grating that is suspended a good 20 feet above what appears to be a
pit.  As you peer around the room you find several dark elves leaning over
the railing watching a large beast dismember an unfortunate elf.  With one
great blow, the beast cleaves the elf in two, and a great cheer rises up
from the dark elves.  The dark elves then go back to betting on how long the
next victim will last.

A Narrow Tunnel
  As you go through the small opening, you find a very small tunnel carved into
the stone. The tunnel leads to the south. As you peer down the tunnel, you 
can just barely make out sounds of screaming, and the light of torches. It 
appears that you might be able to squeeze though.

half eaten by the insects that inhabit the caverns. Perhaps this would be a

  You stand at an entrance to the Great City of Aylor.  To the east, much
of the city is obscured by the enormous number of people travelling the
streets.  In the distance, however, you can see eight silver spires
stretching to the heavens like silver daggers piercing the sky.  To the
northeast, the enormous Aylorian church steeple towers over the city.

To the west, the Western High Road stretches out as a guide through
the continent of Mesolar.  The wide world is open to any adventurers, 
travellers, or merchants willing to take their first steps into the world.

Two large sentry posts stand here guarding the entrance, an unwelcome
sight to invaders.  Manned by elves with bows, the towers are also patrolled
by large rocs that fly overhead.  Shiny metal men stand at the pass checking
credentials and allowing guests into the city.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

       Zyian : Discover What the Cult Under the Well Is Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Where Is Thalien?

Sarah exclaims, "Shortly after he went into the well, I heard him yell, and 
when I looked down I saw some robed people carrying him through a doorway 
behind a large boulder!" 

Sarah exclaims, "I tried to follow them, but the doorway closed before I could 
go any farther, and the noises I heard beyond the door frightened me!" 

Sarah says, "I need you to go in there, rescue Thalien, and see what those 
robed people are doing." 

Sarah says, "He might be too scared to believe you, so if you give him the 
flowers in the well, then he will know that you are on his side."

A Small Well...
  To the rear of the farm lies a small well.  It is in obvious disrepair,
the rope to the bucket frayed, the masonry crumbling, and the bucket having a
small hole in its side.  To the side of the well are a couple large
wheelbarrows, which contain water pulled from the well.

At The Bottom Of The Well
  After lowering yourself down the well for what seems to be an eternity,
you finally reach the bottom of the well.  As you let go of the rope and
land on the well floor, you can see that Sarah was right, the well is bone
dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the
well.  Perhaps these are where the water came from.  To the east, is a small
boulder, which appears to be blocking the way of a rather large hole.

  Parts of bodies lie in a heap here. Some of the body parts are rotting, while
other are merely smashed beyond recognition. A lone man works feverishly on 
what appears to be a golem made entirely out of flesh. As he turns, he looks 
at at you. After giving your body a look, he mumbles, "no no, that won't do".
He then ignores you and goes back to working on his golem.

The Golem Factory
  Parts of bodies lie in a heap here. Some of the body parts are rotting, while
other are merely smashed beyond recognition. A lone man works feverishly on 
what appears to be a golem made entirely out of flesh. As he turns, he looks 
at at you. After giving your body a look, he mumbles, "no no, that won't do".
He then ignores you and goes back to working on his golem.

The Lair of the N'Kari
  Down in the pit, the stench of rotting flesh, blood, and digestive fluids is 
almost too much to bear. You can hear chants from above: "50 gold on the 
N'Kari!" and "A victory over the N'Kari pays 10 to one!". Looks like the dark
elves don't have much confidence in your skills. It's a shame that you didn't
place a wager on yourself before coming down to fight the beast.

The Lair of the N'Kari
  Down in the pit, the stench of rotting flesh, blood, and digestive fluids is 
almost too much to bear. You can hear chants from above: "50 gold on the 
N'Kari!" and "A victory over the N'Kari pays 10 to one!". Looks like the dark
elves don't have much confidence in your skills. It's a shame that you didn't
place a wager on yourself before coming down to fight the beast.

[ Exits: up ]
(Golden Aura) An Elven slave stands here, about to be tossed into the N'Kari Pit.

Syntax: rescue <target>

Amidst the fury of battle, you turn and find your comrade struggling under
the onslaught! Rather than allow them to be severely beaten, you jump between
your friend and their foe, rescuing them from further harm.

Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as well as a comparison of
level, dexterity, and speed between the character and the target. (Note- you
rescue a friend, not the monster.)

Primary stat: Dexterity
Affected by: Luck

The N'Kari Pit
  As you step through the door, you suddenly find yourself standing on a
steel grating that is suspended a good 20 feet above what appears to be a
pit.  As you peer around the room you find several dark elves leaning over
the railing watching a large beast dismember an unfortunate elf.  With one
great blow, the beast cleaves the elf in two, and a great cheer rises up
from the dark elves.  The dark elves then go back to betting on how long the
next victim will last.  

[ Exits: east down ]

A Narrow Tunnel
  As you go through the small opening, you find a very small tunnel carved into
the stone. The tunnel leads to the south. As you peer down the tunnel, you 
can just barely make out sounds of screaming, and the light of torches. It 
appears that you might be able to squeeze though.

  Dank and dark are these caves. You notice that water sheets down the wall in 
some areas of this cave, giving the cavern an almost mirror-like surface. As 
you venture forward, you come across a corpse of a Elf, hacked to bits and 
half eaten by the insects that inhabit the caverns. Perhaps this would be a 
good time to find your way out of here...

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

  The hedges close together overhead, forming a living tunnel of leaves. The 
sun is unable to penetrate the branches and an eternal twilight exists here.
To the west the hedges are closed, you'd have to push your way through them 
to get to the other side. To the east the dark, leafy tunnel continues, and 
it looks like there is a light at the other end.

Tomatoes and capsicums
  Right up near the hedges, the tomatoes have been staked and tied, yet still 
bend over under the heavy burden of their fruits. A few varieties of 
capsicums and peppers have also been staked up, their colourful bounty not as
heavy as that of the tomatoes. Juicy, red tomatoes are ready for the pickings
and some are already gently stacked in wooden pails that sit on the ground 
nearby.

A garden path
  Large stone blocks form a path that runs through a delightful garden. The 
path is well cared for, which shows in the absence of weeds and grasses 
growing up in spaces between the stones. The blocks are of various natural 
shapes and sizes, which fit together perfectly and they have a rough finish 
to them. On either side of the path is a row of yellow and red tulips, in no 
particular pattern, that leads right up to a gate in the hedge wall to the 
far east.

  A small pond glistens in the light, its clear blue waters rippling in the 
wake of the little yellow ducklings that swim across the surface. Tulips of

  A small creek crosses the path through the hedges and a low wooden planked 
bridge crosses it. To either side of the bridge you can see the water flowing
slowly over the stones. The hedges have actually been cut straight over the

  Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the path through the maze. The 
short grass is soft and spongy, which springs back into place, leaving no 
footprints nor any trace of passage. There is a stray apple lying on the 
ground, nestled comfortably underneath a section of the hedges. A soft 
snuffling can be heard, very faintly, but the creature who is making this 
sound is hidden from view.

Dirty disturbances
  In a quiet corner of the garden maze there looks to have been a recent

While, for the most part, the grass is soft and spongy, the ground underneath
the hedge is bare dirt. There is definitely signs of a disturbance on the 
ground and some of the lower branches seem to be broken off. Perhaps it is

ceiling are all made from the same rich, brown soil and it would appear that 
a magical force is keeping the tunnel from collapsing in on itself. The

  The walls of the tunnel are a mixture of dirt and rock, and is quite warm to 
the touch. The air is warm and humid and smells like rotten eggs, which would
make those of lesser constitution gag violently. The ceiling of the tunnel is
made from the rich, deep brown topsoil that keeps the garden above ground 
thriving. Nocturnal beetles burrow into the walls as you approach, chittering
and screeching in protest at your light.

Dry and arid
  The floor of the tunnel is covered in loose dirt and small stones. The walls 
are quite dry and they crumble under slightest pressure. The air is arid and 
warm but smells overripe and pungent. The sound of dripping water is close 
by, but there are no signs of water around you. The sound of a small animal 
scampering over the rocky ground clatters behind you.

  The ground underfoot is quite hard and rocky and your footsteps echo dully 
off the dirt walls. There is loose dirt on the rocky ground and claw marks 
mar the stony surface. A pair of eyes blinks at you from the darkness, their 
eye shine a little eerie with their cold, hard glow. The sound of dripping 
water hits the hard rock like the ticking of a metronome, and the water 
disappears into a crack in the floor.

the tunnels.

A dark corner
  The walls of the tunnels are rough and uneven, as if the magic that carved 
them out was beginning to fail at this point. The loose soil on the walls 
crumbles when you touch it and it feels warm and dry. There is less humidity
here and the earthen surroundings are not so dark and rich as warmer parts of
the tunnels.

dirt of all different sizes and shapes, running in all directions. The air is
warm and humid and the walls are soft and moist. There is a small hole in the
base of one of the walls, just large enough for a rat to squeeze through.

Wallowing worms
  The warm air in the tunnels has grown humid and the earth underfoot is quite 
moist. The foot prints and claw marks are deeper here and the mud sticks to 
the soles of your boots. Water pools in the imprints and the occasional worm 
wallowing in the mud makes little wet sucking sounds. Out of the corner of 
your eye, you catch a glimpse of a small, dark shape scampering away from 
your light.

     (Magic) A set of extra legs might be useful if you are in a hurry to get somewhere.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

A garden path
  Large stone blocks form a path that runs through a delightful garden. The 
path is well cared for, which shows in the absence of weeds and grasses 
growing up in spaces between the stones. The blocks are of various natural 
shapes and sizes, which fit together perfectly and they have a rough finish 
to them. On either side of the path is a row of yellow and red tulips, in no 
particular pattern, that leads right up to a gate in the hedge wall to the 
far east.

A solitude of flowers (G)
  A low, round gazebo, painted white and covered with climbing plants, is 
waiting in quiet solitude. Wisteria vines grow prolifically up the sides of 
the gazebo and the tiny purple flowers emit a heavy perfume. Small bees buzz 
around the flowers, collecting their pollen and blood red roses adorn the 
thorny bushes at either side of the entrance to the gazebo. Inside, seats 
line the walls, and the grassy floor is well cared for.

comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

Dirty disturbances
  In a quiet corner of the garden maze there looks to have been a recent 
commotion in the hedge, like something has been using it as a place to hide.
While, for the most part, the grass is soft and spongy, the ground underneath
the hedge is bare dirt. There is definitely signs of a disturbance on the 
ground and some of the lower branches seem to be broken off. Perhaps it is 
worth investigating ...

A warm, earthy tunnel
  The air in the tunnels is quite warm and a little humid. The walls, floor and
ceiling are all made from the same rich, brown soil and it would appear that 
a magical force is keeping the tunnel from collapsing in on itself. The 
ground underfoot is quite solid, but still soft enough to leave footprints 
behind. There are many kinds of tracks on the tunnel floor from the various 
life forms that live underground.

Earthen escapes
  There is a faint and muted sound of moving bodies not too far away. All 
sounds are muffled so it is impossible to get an idea of what it could be.
The ceiling on this section of the tunnels looks like it has been disturbed

  A low, round gazebo, painted white and covered with climbing plants, is 
waiting in quiet solitude. Wisteria vines grow prolifically up the sides of 
the gazebo and the tiny purple flowers emit a heavy perfume. Small bees buzz 
around the flowers, collecting their pollen and blood red roses adorn the 
thorny bushes at either side of the entrance to the gazebo. Inside, seats 
line the walls, and the grassy floor is well cared for.

  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

Dirty disturbances
  In a quiet corner of the garden maze there looks to have been a recent 
commotion in the hedge, like something has been using it as a place to hide.
While, for the most part, the grass is soft and spongy, the ground underneath
the hedge is bare dirt. There is definitely signs of a disturbance on the 
ground and some of the lower branches seem to be broken off. Perhaps it is 
worth investigating ...

  The air in the tunnels is quite warm and a little humid. The walls, floor and
ceiling are all made from the same rich, brown soil and it would appear that 
a magical force is keeping the tunnel from collapsing in on itself. The 
ground underfoot is quite solid, but still soft enough to leave footprints 
behind. There are many kinds of tracks on the tunnel floor from the various 
life forms that live underground.

disappears into a crack in the floor.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

Dirty disturbances
  In a quiet corner of the garden maze there looks to have been a recent 
commotion in the hedge, like something has been using it as a place to hide.
While, for the most part, the grass is soft and spongy, the ground underneath
the hedge is bare dirt. There is definitely signs of a disturbance on the 
ground and some of the lower branches seem to be broken off. Perhaps it is 
worth investigating ...

  The walls of the tunnel are a mixture of dirt and rock, and is quite warm to 
the touch. The air is warm and humid and smells like rotten eggs, which would
make those of lesser constitution gag violently. The ceiling of the tunnel is

suggesting more twists and turns yet to come. There are paw prints in the 
dirt of all different sizes and shapes, running in all directions. The air is
warm and humid and the walls are soft and moist. There is a small hole in the
base of one of the walls, just large enough for a rat to squeeze through.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.
