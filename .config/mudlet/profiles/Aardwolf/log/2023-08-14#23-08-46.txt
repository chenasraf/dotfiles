  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Before the entrance to the Underdark
  You stand before a huge door.  The corridor can easily fit fifteen humans
standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

Stone Archway
  A chilled breeze rushes through the dark, rough-hewn cavern. The walls are 
covered in scripts and glyphs, visible through an eerie glow that barely 
penetrates the darkness. Broken planks and discarded potion bottles litter 
the floor and a sign of some sort is engraved with a message.

[ Exits: west up ]
A piece of the cavern ceiling crumbles to the ground startling you.

Stone Archway
  A chilled breeze rushes through the dark, rough-hewn cavern. The walls are 
covered in scripts and glyphs, visible through an eerie glow that barely 
penetrates the darkness. Broken planks and discarded potion bottles litter 
the floor and a sign of some sort is engraved with a message.

[ Exits: west up ]
A piece of the cavern ceiling crumbles to the ground startling you.

Inside the Archway
  There is no visible light source in the cavern.  Even light brought in
anticipation of the darkness seems to wither and fail in the curse of this
place.  With every step, the walls seem to shrink in, making the air thick
and musty.  The sounds here echo all around with no definite source.  
 
            Sounds echo in your ears.....
                  Sounds echo in your mind.....
                        Sounds echo in your imagination.....
 
The ground begins to descend to deeper unseeable depths.

[ Exits: north east down ]
     A kabob complete with sizzling quail has fallen here.
(Translucent) Within the dark passage, movement briefly catches your eye.

Descending into the Forlorn Cavern
  The walls are tight, not even an arm's length of room.  The ceiling has
sloped low, barely enough room to stand upright.  The air is heavy, thick,
and the grit of this underground deathtrap hangs heavy in the air.  Sounds
continue the assault from all directions.  

        It seems as if all light has been sucked from this room.

A Widening Passage
  A light to the west is a welcome beacon compared with the darkness and
dreariness of the cavern's narrow descent downwards.  The floor of the
cavern slopes gently towards the light, and the echoing sounds now seem

  The stones have run out and the well-packed dirt serves as a solid path
through the middle of the market.  Sounds of children are definitely coming
from the south now, and a strange mixture of smells is coming from the
north.  Crowds of people push and shove their way to the produce stands,
anxious to get the best available, and at the best price.

Walkway Through the Market
  The hard packed dirt appears to be a bit more trampled here.  The dirt is
torn up towards the north and small footprints can be seen darting around
the south exit.  Street hawkers, gossiping shoppers and the shrieks of
children at play mix together in a cacophony of chaotic sounds.  The market
spreads in every direction.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

Before a Small Castle
  As the path ends you stand before a small stone castle.  Looking up, you
see one single tower spiraling into the sky.  The gate to the castle is
closed and nobody stands guard.  The castle looks as though it has been kept
up well though.  Its walls are perfectly intact, and the grass around it has
recently been trimmed.  Yet, the castle looks absolutely deserted.

The Gallery of Champions
  You stand in a huge art gallery.  Many paintings of men and women in
armor line the walls.  You guess that these are portraits of previous
tournament winners.  Examining the paintings, you see that whoever made them
has exceptional artistic skill.  Perhaps you can tell the artist that you
are a knight also and commission yourself a painting?

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

on the floor. Compared to the opulence of the entrance area, this corridor 
seems rather squalid, and you wonder where it leads?

Dank Corridor
  You walk along a small corridor carved into the black rock of the fortress.
The darkness and weight of the rock above you are oppressive, and you hope to
find an exit soon. Being careful not to slip on the slimy floor you move on.

Dank Stone Corridor
  You walk along a damp musty smelling stone corridor. To the west the corridor
narrows somewhat, while to the east it appears to be wider. Small animals 
scuttle away into the shadows as you approach, and you brush spider webs out 
of your face with a grimace of disgust. Suddenly from the east you hear the 
horrific screams of a person in unendurable pain! Should you risk exploring?

On the Stairway
  You stand on a narrow winding stair leading down into the rock under the

down into the darkness below.

Falling Down the Stairs
  Whoops! Your armor overbalances you and you slip on some slime, suddenly you 
find yourself falling down the steep stone stairway into the darkness below.
Looking around you realise that you have fallen into a deep pit. A sturdy 
iron door is set into the east wall, you hope it's not locked, as there seems
to be no other way out, the ceiling has closed up, and you assume that it 
must be some kind of a trap-door, and you fell right into the trap!

  This large room is used by Guards who make sure that no unauthorized people 
are wandering around the Fortress. The room is sparsely furnished, containing
only a large stone table, and a few chairs. The floor is dirty, and littered 
with bones and food scraps. Much of the walls are covered with scrawled words
written in the ugly Yurgach script. You should be glad you can't read them!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Help Category : Transport.
Last Updated  : 2017-09-01 09:01:58.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:  mist <direction1> (<direction2>)

This ethereal ability allows its target to move through a single room
completely undetected. While in mist form, the target cannot be detected or
attacked by normal means, allowing the user to pass through potentially
dangerous rooms without harm.

If you only enter one direction, you will attempt to move that direction
twice.  If you move in an invalid direction, you will stop where you are.
You cannot use mist form in clan rooms or out of a prison-flagged room.
Some monsters have abilities (such as those that happen upon entering or
leaving a room) that may still fire and interrupt the ability.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

  You stand on a wide, well-worn path that leads away to the west and
toward a distant forest of tall blackpines.  All around you is silence.  No
birds sing, no insects chirp; even the wind is still.  Perhaps it is the
presence of the Black Tower that stands before you to the south.  A large
black gate blocks the path directly to the south, and unless you carry the
key, you can go no further in this direction.  Perhaps it is just as well;
this place looks nasty!

     A black iron key lies here.

horrific and sadistic looking implements of torture. Iron maidens and racks 
are in lined up along one wall, and a table covered with thumb-screws, 
needles, pincers, tongs, branding-irons and other items, sits in the middle 
of the room. This room is obviously where the Yurgach torture their 
prisoners, or just come to have some fun, after a hard day beating the slaves
and killing people.  After a closer inspection, it appears you might be able
to squeeze inside the brazier, if you're willing to risk getting stuck.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  The temple is made from the same stones that make up the manor itself. The

>>    Temple foyer
  The foyer of the temple is cool and dim, allowing you to reflect on your time
here, whether coming or going. There are some ancient scrolls, situated 
behind glass, on pedestals to the left and right of the main doors. A white 
pillar candle, large enough to need three wicks, sits in each of the two 
arched niches, to the left and right of the inner temple door. Below each 
candle is a bronze plate, with offerings of gold and flowers, for the 
resident goddess, Ayla.

  There are many wooden pews in the temple to choose from for quiet prayer and 
reflection. Some of these pews have occupants, who have come for their own 
varied reasons, to pray to Ayla for comfort and peace. There is an old couple
sitting in the back row, their hands clasped tightly in each other's as they 
seek comfort in their time of prayer. There is a young lady, with a bunch of 
yellow daisies in her hand, weeping quietly towards the middle of the temple.
At the far end is a raised dais, upon which a large book sits on a simple

A memorial alcove
  This alcove is dedicated to the memory of those who have passed from the 
living realms. Many small candles have been placed on long shelves along one 
of the walls. The wax from these candles has pooled and dried on the shelves,
creating a stable environment for the multitude of candles that have been 
placed here. A large box with a small slit at the top stands against the 
southern wall. Inside this box are letters to the goddess Ayla asking for 
help, blessings and offering of prayers.

[ Exits: north (down) ]
     (Magic) Many small candles burn for the dead.

Catacombs
  A long, low moan drifts to you through the dark tunnels to the south. The 
sound of splintering wood snaps in the background and something heavy falls 
to the tiled floor. A cold breath of stale air brushes past you, enticing 
goose bumps to form. The sandstone walls are cold to the touch and crumble 
slightly under pressure, the grit falling to the floor in small showers. The 
passageway to the south is dark, while to the east you can see the light from
the entrance to the catacombs.

Catacombs [**> PK <**]
  The walls of the catacombs are made of a soft sandstone, which crumbles 
slightly under your touch. The tiled floor has weathered the passage of time 
quite well, though one of them looks to have cracked. The air is dry and 
dusty, having been sealed up from the outside world for some time. A low moan
drifts to you from deeper into the tunnels that branch off to the east and 
west. To the north is the way out and back up to the temple.

The scraping of bone on stone sounds from within the dark, grating on your

sends a paralysing chill through you, coaxing goose bumps to arise over your

A memorial alcove (1673)

Wooden pews
  At the front section of the pews you can see more of the temple. To the north
is a secluded alcove, with a wooden screen, which has been folded back 
against the wall, revealing two comfortable chairs. To the south is an alcove
with many candles burning in niches in the walls. To the north you can see 
the altar behind the pedestal, which is covered with fruit, flowers and 
plates of jewellery and gold. In the front pew is an old man, white beard 
flowing down his chest. He does not notice your presence, his eyes staring up
at the large tapestry of Ayla, hanging on the back wall, his lips moving 
ceaselessly in a never ending prayer to the goddess.

     (Magic) Wooden pews line the main temple in neat rows.

>>    Wooden pews
  There are many wooden pews in the temple to choose from for quiet prayer and 
reflection. Some of these pews have occupants, who have come for their own 
varied reasons, to pray to Ayla for comfort and peace. There is an old couple
sitting in the back row, their hands clasped tightly in each other's as they 
seek comfort in their time of prayer. There is a young lady, with a bunch of 
yellow daisies in her hand, weeping quietly towards the middle of the temple.
At the far end is a raised dais, upon which a large book sits on a simple 
wooden pedestal.

  The foyer of the temple is cool and dim, allowing you to reflect on your time
here, whether coming or going. There are some ancient scrolls, situated 
behind glass, on pedestals to the left and right of the main doors. A white 
pillar candle, large enough to need three wicks, sits in each of the two 
arched niches, to the left and right of the inner temple door. Below each 
candle is a bronze plate, with offerings of gold and flowers, for the 
resident goddess, Ayla.

A dark wood
  Deep in the dark wood you stumble upon a secluded cabin that looks a little 
worse for wear. The trees have grown right up against the walls and there are
some seedlings on the rotting wooden roof. A once tidy rose garden has now 
grown wild and they have spread all over the immediate area, climbing up the 
walls of the cabin. They have created a thicket of thorns that it would be 
wise to stay away from. A large dragonfly, with long gossamer wings, buzzes 
right past you.

[ Exits: north (east) south west ]

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

Approaching Diamond Castle (1679)

In front of Diamond Castle
  Doric columns of pure diamond support this magnificent castle.  Beams of
light encircle the dwelling, illuminating the crystal with an holy
brilliance and a divine majesty.  You slowly raise your hand up to feel the
outer wall, and despite having been exposed to the elements, it is as soft
and tender as a baby's skin, while still having an untold of inner
resilience.  You bow your head in respect for the castle, and notice a
welcome mat on the ground.  The mat is completely lavish as well, having
been woven with intertwined strands of gold and silver.  If the exterior is
any indication, the beauty and grace to be found within will surpass any
you have seen.

  After opening the diamond gate and entering the castle, your senses are
overcome with amazement and wonder.  Even the inner walls of this
magnificent castle are made of diamond.  As you step across the floor, the
shock of your feet smacking the ground is absorbed, and instead of making a
cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which
separates the rest of the castle from the arborium, and to the south is the
castle dining room.  The castle hallway continues east.

Inside the dining room (1677)

Inside the kitchen
  The various cooks and maids gather together here, as it is their "home
base," so to speak.  You smell so much stuff at once that your nose cannot
register it all: beef stew, delectible fried shrimp, golden brown chicken
...  There is just so much to cook that the chefs have problems keeping up
with it all.  The serving maids are running back and forth so much that
there is a huge rut in the floor where their feet tread so hastily.  A huge
cauldron hordes the space in the kitchen's center, and it is there where the
cooks magically bake, fry, and marinate everything.  How they do it, you
don't know.  The dining room is above you and a tiny door to the west
functions as a service entrance to the kitchen.  

[ Exits: (west) up ]
(Golden Aura) A cook is here running frantically back and forth.
(Red Aura) A maid is here trying to annoy the cooks.

  You have entered a room of nothingness; there is no sound, no breeze, no
sign of life whatsoever, just a large dark hole.  This hole is said to lead
to a world of eternal darkness that is sure to drive you mad if you wander
through it for too long.

  A cold stream of moonlight makes a curious circuit through these stars,
shining like a polished pearl.  Flowing out of the moongate, it goes past
Canopus, down and around Rigel, then west to Zaurac.  From there, it then
heads north past Absolvo Te, north to Kitalpha, and around to the east until
it has come full circle.  Kitalpha is just northwest of here, the moongate
being far to the northeast and Absolvo Te being off to the southwest.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

Into the dark (G)
  You have entered a room of nothingness; there is no sound, no breeze, no
sign of life whatsoever, just a large dark hole.  This hole is said to lead
to a world of eternal darkness that is sure to drive you mad if you wander
through it for too long.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Walk of the Stars - Requiem
  This path through the stars seems to have been formed by magic from the
music of an imperial dirge.  The terrifying power of this song, played
whenever those who control the metallic moon go into battle, resonates not
with sadness for those lost, but with the reminder of the doom which awaits
any who oppose them.  This terrifying path winds a circle past Bunda, down
to Deneb and Gianfar, west between Chort and Spica, turning north near
Corona Aerianni, then east, meandering between Nasil and Zacuto to complete
its circuit.  Chort is just south of here and Spica is just northwest.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Wandering through the forest was a bad idea. Not only is it cold and wet, but

same brightness. Even the sounds of the forest have been muffled by some 
unseen force. The remains of an animal trail loop and twist around, 
eventually extending out of sight.

  The castle has hardly been touched along the east side. The doors to the 
north have been etched with some primal runes, casting an intense, pulsating 
light of red and blue. The light creates undulating shadows that dance along 
the warpath. The kobolds seem to be frightened by either the glyphs or the 
shadows, as they avoid treading along the east side of the castle.

  The south side of the castle seems to have taken the brunt of the damage from
the kobolds. Huge chunks of stone have been knocked free from the walls, 
revealing a slightly lighter color of stone beneath. Although there is no 
telling how thick the walls are, the massive pocks in the wall must be 
weakening the structural integrity of the wall. Along with the massive damage
comes massive casualties. Kobold and Eldar bodies are strewn about in various
stages of decay. The road is littered with bones of all shapes and sizes, all
of which are weathered and cracked.

  The path around the southern part of the castle has been cut directly out of 
the forest. The forest continues to the south, dense and moist, dangerous and
unforgiving. The corpses of kobolds litter the path, fresh ones piling on top
of the bones of their brothers in arms. Small pocks in the castle walls prove
the kobolds have been successful, though the level of success is debatable.
The path continues to the east, with the forest's daunting blackness to the 
south.

  Standing at the northwest corner of the castle wall reveals the magnitude of 
the siege effort. The siege camp appears to be so much smaller than the 
castle itself that the efforts of the kobolds would appear to be in vain.
Looking back at the castle tells a different story, however; large sections 
of the castle have plenty of pockmarks. In spite of the missing pieces of 
rock, a hole through to the other side of the wall has not been created.

  A massive tower to the northwest casts a shadow on the warpath. The gigantic
bricks remain unmolested on the east side of the corner, while the south side
of the castle is starting to show signs of the siege. The tropical heat and 
dampness from the forest to the south belies the sound of waves crashing 
somewhere to the north. Red and blue lights can occasionally be seen, 
flaring and dying to the north.

  Approaching the southwest corner of the castle reveals extensive damage and 
losses. Kobold and Eldar corpses line the war path, piled against the castle 
wall opposite the path. Innumerable feet have pounded a path of hard dirt to 
the north and south, the latter rounding to the east, around the corner of 
the castle. The damage to the castle looks to be greater to the south than 
anywhere else along its western side. The war camp can still be heard over 
the din of fighting along the battle path.

  A massive tower of the castle looms to the east. The sheer size of the 
structure almost overshadows the blood and corpses that litter the path 
around the castle. Eldar in the ramparts sling spells down at the kobolds 
attempting to breach the castle walls. Despite the eldars' best efforts, 
chunks of stone have been savagely removed from the castle's bricks.
However, there's no telling how thick the walls are, thus making each small 
hole insignificant.

Edge of the Nenukon (G)
  You stand at the edge of the Nenukon. A dark and twisted region of the world.
Deep within lies what is said to be the ultimate evil, and also the resting 
place of the only thing that can stop it. Beyond the Nenukon is said to be 
the Empire of The Far Country, a land of warriors, where the governing tribes
themselves are in a constant state of war.

The Great Eastern Desert
  A rocky wasteland stretches out ahead.  A few stunted cactii are all that
grow in this dry, hot desert.  There seems to be very little life here,
perhaps the animals are hiding in shadowy areas?

  These mountains appear to jut up from the ground here from nowhere, as
the surrounding area appears to be flat plains.  The unusual composition of
the rocks here also appear to be completely different from the rest of the
continent, adding to the mystery of the range.  A desert seems to occupy the
area inside this ring of mountains as well, another mystery of this
otherwise temperate land.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  The road you have been walking on has become clouded up ahead. A thick 
choking fog has descended and envelops it and you as well. The air is 
choking heavy with the moisture and a sickeningly sweet smell. You can't 
quite place your finger on it. As you turn your head to look about, you find 
that the way back has become obscured. The only things you can make out 
clearly are the road under your feet and the soft glow of the light above
you...

Sentry Post
  The sentry post is a slightly elevated tower that stands over the moat.
Here, a few men of the king will gather and if not on duty, sometimes will 
play at cards or dice to while away the time. During peaceful times, it is 
not uncommon to have quite a big tournament, where the losers are thrown into
the moat with much laughter among the men.

Inside the trader, Typhoon
  You find yourself in a ship, full of opportunities. But don't let the Typhoon
captain catch you here! He can be very nasty after a full bottle of whiskey.
But that's only if he is awakened from his drunken stupor. So this is one of 
the famous trade ships of Lem-Dagor. It's not very impressive right now, as 
it doesn't seem to have a very valuable cargo at the moment.

  You have entered the room, where the Wave runners always ask their guests to
stay.  It is very well decorated here, to show respect to the visitors of
the Wave Runner (NOT).  The room is two by two meters and completely
empty, except for a very hard bed.  To the north is the door, but it is
closed, locked and completely impassable.  There has to be some way to get

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

  The fall from the shaft didn't seem so bad from above, but the landing didn't

  It is very dark inside this dungeon. Perhaps lighting one of the torches on 
the wall would help brighten the place a bit? There's a strange wooden door 
to the east. Above the door, a skull hangs from the ceiling. This must be the

  While wandering through the dungeon basement, you've stumbled upon some sort 
of light source! Beneath the door to the east a glow can be seen. It's no 
ordinary glow, however. It appears to moving randomly, as if from a magical 
source. On the other hand, no noises can be heard coming from the other side 
of the door. The hallway continues north and west.

A bend in the basement
  Exploring this basement gives a lightheaded feeling to those who walk 
through. Perhaps it is the lack of oxygen within the basement? There are not 
many live bodies down here breathing the same air you are. The tomb keepers

here at all. The dark hallway continues west and south.

Intersection in the hall of the damned
  These hallways are very reminiscent of the hallways from the tombs, except 
there is much more movement and sound here. There are lit torches hanging 
from the ceiling, and there is moisture in the air. There are obviously 
beings assigned to keep these hallways clean and bright. There are exits 
north, east, and west. The exit from these halls lies to the south.

have left the bodies of the tombs at bay. There is no door on the building, 
but there appears to be no visible exit from this area. Perhaps this is what 
was floating in the strange orange aura floating above the tombs? The only 
exit is to the north, which ventures into the halls of the damned.

Intersection in the hall of the damned
  These hallways are very reminiscent of the hallways from the tombs, except 
there is much more movement and sound here. There are lit torches hanging 
from the ceiling, and there is moisture in the air. There are obviously 
beings assigned to keep these hallways clean and bright. There are exits 
north, east, and west. The exit from these halls lies to the south.

Hallway of the damned
  As this hallway continues, the noises seems to become softer and the lighting
a bit dim. To the north, an intersection of two hallways can be seen. A small
pool of water has accumulated on the floor here. A small opening in the 
ceiling reveals the source of the water. To the south, activity can be seen 
as the hallway continues.

An intersection of hallways
  Two hallways within the halls of the damned come to a meeting here. The 
hallway extending east appears to be a bit darker, with less activity, while 
the hallway to the south is well lit and has a good amount of more activity.
There are markings on the walls here, but they are not of any meaning to 
mortals.

A small cell
  You have stumbled upon a cell of sorts within these halls. There are no 
shackles, chains or bars here, since the inhabitants of these halls would be 
able to easily escape them. There are three lit torches on each wall, proving
more than enough light to see everything within the cell.

  What appeared to be a cell from the hallway to the south is actually a throne
of sorts. You try to examine the throne closer, but your mortal mind can't

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

Welcome to Grandmarket Boulevard! (G)
  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

that the way back has become obscured. The only things you can make out 
clearly are the road under your feet and the soft glow of the light above
you...

Approaching a Castle
  The path is level here. Looking back southwards, it drops steeply towards the
forested lands below. Looking northwards, the plateau upon which the castle 
battlements stand is surprisingly lush with berry bushes and ivies.

A local resident is here.

Before a Castle Wall
  The castle battlements loom immediately to the north. Along the wall, peasant
hovels lean. There, pens of animals and small gardens grow. A peasant pokes 
his head out of one of the hovel doors, but quickly retreats. Visitors are 
few, and viewed with suspicion, it would appear. However, the castle gates 
are open, indicating the times are quite peaceful, or so it would seem.

The Castle Courtyard
  You stand in the courtyard, within the castle walls. There is a hustle and 
bustle all around you, as the residents of the castle go about their daily 
chores. Looking about, you can see the tops of apple trees growing beyond the
orchard gates. The entrance to the main hall of the castle is to the west.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it

of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an

A beautiful garden
  There is a small, bubbling spring, amongst the many flowering plants, that 
tinkles quietly. River stones have been brought in to make the spring more of
a feature in the garden, as well as giving water to the plants. The stones 
have also formed a shallow bowl, which the birds like to ruffle their 
feathers in. Some insects have taken advantage of the water, laying their 
eggs in the calmer areas. Flowering shrubs offer food and shelter to the 
local wildlife as well as decorating the garden with their unique flowers.

A beautiful garden
  This beautiful garden is very well tended by loving hands. Wild daffodils 
grow along the rocky garden edge, their bright yellow petals, with the 
trumpet-like centre piece, a delight to the local bees and butterflies. A 
bush, with long stems covered in hundreds of tiny purple flowers, sits to the
rear of the garden. The variety of plants and the colours of the flowers are 
quite wondrous. There are some wooden benches placed at intervals on the 
green grass and against the wall of the temple, giving you an opportunity to 
sit in the sun and enjoy the sensory delights of the garden.

Aardington manor
  The foyer of the large bluestone manor is quite imposing. Everything in the 
manor speaks of wealth; old and timeless wealth. The floor is made from a 
white and black marble, inlaid with gold veins and specks. A deep, rich red 
carpet runner extends down the length of the main hall from the other side of
the foyer. Solid, polished wooden pedestals stand on either side of the front
doors, and hold a large antique vase each, which are many centuries old.
Long glass windows, framed by thick velvet curtains, allow plenty of 
sunlight to filter in. The occasional guard can be seen patrolling the 
grounds. A butler, impeccably dressed, greets you in the foyer.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A dark forest
  Wandering through the forest was a bad idea. Not only is it cold and wet, but
also unnaturally dark. Regardless of the time of day, the forest stays the 
same brightness. Even the sounds of the forest have been muffled by some 
unseen force. The remains of an animal trail loop and twist around, 
eventually extending out of sight.

  The disarray continues throughout the barracks, and gets worse farther from

The barracks
  The kobold soldiers' sleeping quarters are in shambles. This structure could
never be described as a tent, as the walls are torn and the roof was never 
completed. The soldiers clearly only spend time here to sleep. There is no 
order to how, where, or if the bunks are organized throughout this area.
Fighting, yelling and general disarray run rampant, this is not a safe part 
of the warcamp, if there are any.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

Deeper Within the Cavern
  The cavern seems to be getting darker and you slow down a little to let
your eyes adjust to the darkness.  The darkness is getting to you and you
start to panic!!  While frantically looking for a way out, you feel the

  The light at the end of the tunnel!!  You feel so relieved after being
cramped up in the caverns.  You must be getting closer to the Citadel.  From
a distance, you can hear the warcries and clashing of swords..  Turning your
head towards the sounds, you come upon a small valley that has been burned
down by fighting.  You step closer to the burning bushes and trees and
hear the sounds grow stronger.  You must be close to the battlefield!

Stone Avenue
  The sounds of people talking, gravel crunching underfoot and wheels
squeaking surround you as you walk down the Stone Avenue.  All sorts of
people hurry past you as they go about their business.  The buildings that
line the street are tall and for the most part uninviting.  The avenue forks
at this point, you see that it leads to a side street to the east and the
castle gates to the north.

Castle Gates
  You get the perfect opportunity to admire the beauty of the Citadel as
you stand at the gates.  The walls are built of many different stones and
gems, creating a glorious pattern across the surface.  The citadel seems to
glow as the sun shines and glints on the polished surface.  You cannot even
imagine how much time it must have taken to build such an amazing building. 
Before coming to the Stone City you had heard many stories of the Citadel's
beauty, but still you did not expect to find a building as magical and
enchanting as this.

  You find yourself at the very gates of the of this fabled city.  You gasp
as you realize that you have finally arrived at this city you once thought
only existed in rumors and fairy tales.  To the north of the gate you hear
the bustling sounds of its inhabitants.  You can hardly wait to meet them
and explore!

Before the Fabled City
  The City of Stone looms ahead of you.  The towering stone monuments of
the city contrast with the luscious green of your immediate surroundings.  It
appears majestic, the simple curves of the stone buildings reflect the
sunset slightly, creating an almost eerie feeling.  From this distance you
can't see any movement or life inside the city.  Wondering if the city will
be as quiet and serene inside its walls as it appears from here, you
continue on your journey.

  Stepping out of the bushes, you find yourself in a less dense part of the
forest.  Beams of light from the sky shine down creating leafy patterns over
the ground.  Animals roam peacefully, searching for food and enjoying the
sun.  You feel relieved to be away from the constant fighting, but the
occaisional sound of a muffled scream ahead makes you wonder if even these
tranquil surroundings are safe.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

down by fighting.  You step closer to the burning bushes and trees and

The Perfect Road (G)
  You are on the most beautifully kept and built road you've ever seen. 
Each individual stone appears so clean it may have been scrubbed with a
toothbrush, and is set so flawlessly you can barely tell where one stone
ends and the next begins.  The road travels for what appears to be a fairly
short distance towards the north, heading for the largest dome you've ever
seen.  Could that be the infamous Gladiator's Arena?  

[ Exits: north down ]
     It's hard to tell through all the mold, but this bread looks hard as a rock!

Outside the Arena (G)
  The road you are on remains nearly perfect in every way, and cleaner than
any you've seen before; yet now you can see signs of traffic on the cobbled
stones, where decades of long hard use have begun to wear the stones a
little TOO smooth.  In front of you is the single largest building you've
ever seen; easily ten stories tall, and at least eight thousand feet in
diameter, this perfect dome is reputed to have been built so well that a
whisper spoken anywhere inside would carry to any other part of the
building.  The walls are unbelievably smooth, and so clean that the sun
practically reflects off of the dark grey granite.  An enormous archway to
the north, fifty feet at its peak and twice as wide, provides access to the
dome.  

[ Exits: south ]
A gigantic man stands here, guarding the doors into the Gladiator's Arena.
The Entrance Guard gets a greedy gleam in his eyes.
The Entrance Guard exclaims, "Welcome to the Gladiator's Arena, sir! For a
 small fee, you may enter and try your skills against some of the finest
 warriors, and... uhm... others the land has to offer!"

The Perfect Road (G)
  You are on the most beautifully kept and built road you've ever seen. 
Each individual stone appears so clean it may have been scrubbed with a
toothbrush, and is set so flawlessly you can barely tell where one stone
ends and the next begins.  The road travels for what appears to be a fairly
short distance towards the north, heading for the largest dome you've ever
seen.  Could that be the infamous Gladiator's Arena?

  The road you are on remains nearly perfect in every way, and cleaner than
any you've seen before; yet now you can see signs of traffic on the cobbled
stones, where decades of long hard use have begun to wear the stones a
little TOO smooth.  In front of you is the single largest building you've
ever seen; easily ten stories tall, and at least eight thousand feet in
diameter, this perfect dome is reputed to have been built so well that a
whisper spoken anywhere inside would carry to any other part of the
building.  The walls are unbelievably smooth, and so clean that the sun
practically reflects off of the dark grey granite.  An enormous archway to
the north, fifty feet at its peak and twice as wide, provides access to the
dome.

Inside the Gigantic Archway
  Rising to a curved peak some 50 feet above you, the archway you stand
in now is easily the biggest you've ever seen...  Or heard of...  Or even
imagined!  Yet every inch of it is spotlessly clean, and was immaculately
carved, crafted, and set.  Each stone integrates so seamlessly with the next
that not even a speck of mortar is visible, and the entire archway looks
almost like a natural formation.  Even the intricate carvings, spaced at
even intervals approximately one foot apart, that cover the archway were
done by such a master artisan that you could easily believe they were
natural.  The designs seem to have no apparent pattern or significance. 
They seem to be merely random swirls, loops, and assorted geometric
patterns, shaped in such a way that if you stare at them for long enough,
you can see a myriad of different half-formed images, which never quite come
completely to the foreground.  It's eerily similar to the effect you get
when looking at the clouds for a long time, and can see shapes emerging, but
never quite defining themselves.  A little to the east, the dome opens up
into a vastly cavernous space, so large it's hard to believe it's truly
housed within a man-made building...

Entrance to the Gladiator's Arena
  You are in a room so vast that it's beyond all possible imagining.  The
only way your mind can even begin to assess your surroundings is by
partitioning the room into several sections.  Your nearby surroundings, like
everything else you've seen so far, were designed with loving care and
master craftsmanship; yet here the similarities end.  No longer are dirt and
grime removed with what appeared to have been the religious fervor of a
horde of fanatically devoted priests, and a wide variety of stains are
splattered on the ground and walls, the most common of which is a thick,
sticky substance that appears to be blackening rust...  A sight any true
warrior would know in an instant; blood.  The stones are worn in many
places, so heavily trodden upon over the years that you cannot even make out
a discernible path; it seems as if every inch of every stone has been walked
on so often that what may have once been foot-thick granite is now so thin
as to be brittle.  Everywhere you look you see people.  Every 5 to 10 feet a
little cart is set up, with a man or woman hawking their wares to any who
will listen.  Food vendors appear to be the most common, yet it seems as if
you could buy anything your heart desired here.  Most city markets don't
offer this much variety!  Guards, ushers, tourists, and of course Gladiators
of every race and nation wander about here and there, talking, competing in
various games of skill, or simply horsing around.  While the entire building
is far too large to see, much less process in your mind, you can tell that
one of the two most famous areas of this building, the fighting arena
itself, is off towards the east.  Stairs leading up, and a ladder heading
down through a hole in the ground offer other exits, but to destinations
which you cannot quite see from here.

Entrance to the Fighting Arena
  Spread out before you in a mind-boggling array are all of the various sub
arenas, rings, and cages of the infamous Fighting Arena.  Here it is
possible to engage in just about any form of combat imaginable; anything
from hand to hand fighting to full sieges with body armor and chariots is
available here, all in pre-made environments.  Contests and tournaments are
held here often, sometimes for very large prizes, but most of the time this
entire arena is open to all warriors, of any race or nationality, to
practice or test their skills against each other for sport.  The entire
arena is ringed with raised stands for spectators, but they are not visible
from here.  A flight of stairs would seem to lead towards them, while the
tunnel leading down from here is a relative mystery to you.

The Group Fighting Rings [**> PK <**]
  Located in a section of the arena roughly 500 feet squared are a series
of "rings," of varying sizes.  Each ring is just an area defined by either a
low rising wooden wall, generally about 3 feet high, a painted circle on the
ground (usually black), or a much taller brick wall, perhaps 8 feet high. 
Many of the rings have thematic decorations inside them, ranging from
designs as simple as "protect the flag," to settings as complex as "protect
the innocents, ration the food and water, and hold off the siege."  This is
where Gladiator groups of almost any size can fight each other, stage fake
sieges, or even fake wars.

Entrance to the Fighting Arena
  Spread out before you in a mind-boggling array are all of the various sub
arenas, rings, and cages of the infamous Fighting Arena.  Here it is
possible to engage in just about any form of combat imaginable; anything
from hand to hand fighting to full sieges with body armor and chariots is
available here, all in pre-made environments.  Contests and tournaments are
held here often, sometimes for very large prizes, but most of the time this
entire arena is open to all warriors, of any race or nationality, to
practice or test their skills against each other for sport.  The entire
arena is ringed with raised stands for spectators, but they are not visible
from here.  A flight of stairs would seem to lead towards them, while the
tunnel leading down from here is a relative mystery to you.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Entrance to the Gladiator's Arena
  You are in a room so vast that it's beyond all possible imagining.  The
only way your mind can even begin to assess your surroundings is by
partitioning the room into several sections.  Your nearby surroundings, like
everything else you've seen so far, were designed with loving care and
master craftsmanship; yet here the similarities end.  No longer are dirt and
grime removed with what appeared to have been the religious fervor of a
horde of fanatically devoted priests, and a wide variety of stains are
splattered on the ground and walls, the most common of which is a thick,
sticky substance that appears to be blackening rust...  A sight any true
warrior would know in an instant; blood.  The stones are worn in many
places, so heavily trodden upon over the years that you cannot even make out
a discernible path; it seems as if every inch of every stone has been walked
on so often that what may have once been foot-thick granite is now so thin
as to be brittle.  Everywhere you look you see people.  Every 5 to 10 feet a
little cart is set up, with a man or woman hawking their wares to any who
will listen.  Food vendors appear to be the most common, yet it seems as if
you could buy anything your heart desired here.  Most city markets don't
offer this much variety!  Guards, ushers, tourists, and of course Gladiators
of every race and nation wander about here and there, talking, competing in
various games of skill, or simply horsing around.  While the entire building
is far too large to see, much less process in your mind, you can tell that
one of the two most famous areas of this building, the fighting arena
itself, is off towards the east.  Stairs leading up, and a ladder heading
down through a hole in the ground offer other exits, but to destinations
which you cannot quite see from here.

Inside the Gigantic Archway
  Rising to a curved peak some 50 feet above you, the archway you stand
in now is easily the biggest you've ever seen...  Or heard of...  Or even
imagined!  Yet every inch of it is spotlessly clean, and was immaculately
carved, crafted, and set.  Each stone integrates so seamlessly with the next
that not even a speck of mortar is visible, and the entire archway looks
almost like a natural formation.  Even the intricate carvings, spaced at
even intervals approximately one foot apart, that cover the archway were
done by such a master artisan that you could easily believe they were
natural.  The designs seem to have no apparent pattern or significance. 
They seem to be merely random swirls, loops, and assorted geometric
patterns, shaped in such a way that if you stare at them for long enough,
you can see a myriad of different half-formed images, which never quite come
completely to the foreground.  It's eerily similar to the effect you get
when looking at the clouds for a long time, and can see shapes emerging, but
never quite defining themselves.  A little to the east, the dome opens up
into a vastly cavernous space, so large it's hard to believe it's truly
housed within a man-made building...

The Perfect Road (G)
  You are on the most beautifully kept and built road you've ever seen. 
Each individual stone appears so clean it may have been scrubbed with a
toothbrush, and is set so flawlessly you can barely tell where one stone
ends and the next begins.  The road travels for what appears to be a fairly
short distance towards the north, heading for the largest dome you've ever
seen.  Could that be the infamous Gladiator's Arena?

Center of Oasis Island
  The ground is raised here, where a single palm tree grows, bending
towards the east.  The tree stands tall and defiantly, a contrast to the
mere grasses that surround it.  The entire island is visible from this
vantage point, and beyond the beaches, you can see the raging waters of the
surrounding whirlpool.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Waves gently lap at the glimmering sands here, creating a calming rhythmic

seamen tirelessly unloading supplies. Inland a short distance, you spot a 
makeshift camp positioned just before a towering forest. A dim rainbow arcs 
up in front of the camp like an entryway.

  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood

deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

  Wandering through the forest was a bad idea. Not only is it cold and wet, but
also unnaturally dark. Regardless of the time of day, the forest stays the 
same brightness. Even the sounds of the forest have been muffled by some 
unseen force. The remains of an animal trail loop and twist around, 
eventually extending out of sight.

(Golden Aura) The eldar hermit skillfully navigates the forest.
(Hidden) (Golden Aura) (White Aura) An unusually large firefly is here, and it appears to be
watching you.
(Red Aura) A kobold shaman hides in the underbrush, waiting for an ally.
 
As you enter, you see a kobold dive into some bushes and wait for you to leave.

  The battle rages on! Kobolds of all shapes and sizes, armed to the teeth, and
not a single one of them cleaned, rush around the field. The battle cries 
range from words that aren't understandable to guttural cries for blood. The 
camp to the west feels unreachable, as a stream of kobolds continue to stream
from that direction. Their objective appears to be carnage as much as it is 
victory. At least they're achieving one of those goals.

  You stand on the east side of the altar in the grand Aylorian Church.  To
the north is a large wooden door that leads out to the Templar's Road of
Andolar.  To the east is a small nook with golden curtains cascading from
ceiling to floor.  A large mithril throne stands in the middle of the room
on which sits a man dressed head to toe in leather armor.  Women to his left
and right fawn over him, cooing and giggling like school girls.

  The road you have been walking on has become clouded up ahead. A thick 
choking fog has descended and envelops it and you as well. The air is 
choking heavy with the moisture and a sickeningly sweet smell. You can't 
quite place your finger on it. As you turn your head to look about, you find 
that the way back has become obscured. The only things you can make out 
clearly are the road under your feet and the soft glow of the light above
you...

The Moat Bridge
  You are at the farthest end of the bridge over the moat. On each side, there 
is a sentry post. However, despite this evidence of defensiveness, the gates 
to the castle are open. These must be times of peace indeed.

  Cottages line the road to the north and south. They are small but very tidy 
and in excellent repair, judging by the fresh thatch on the roofs. Each 
cottage has a brightly painted door, representing the only real difference 
among them. Perhaps the farmers, after a long day of toil in the fields and a
few pints of ale afterwards, use the door color as their guide to finding 
home.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

  You find yourself in a ship, full of opportunities. But don't let the Typhoon
captain catch you here! He can be very nasty after a full bottle of whiskey.
But that's only if he is awakened from his drunken stupor. So this is one of 
the famous trade ships of Lem-Dagor. It's not very impressive right now, as 
it doesn't seem to have a very valuable cargo at the moment.

  You find yourself in a ship, full of opportunities. But don't let the Typhoon
captain catch you here! He can be very nasty after a full bottle of whiskey.
But that's only if he is awakened from his drunken stupor. So this is one of 
the famous trade ships of Lem-Dagor. It's not very impressive right now, as 
it doesn't seem to have a very valuable cargo at the moment.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You find yourself in a ship, full of opportunities. But don't let the Typhoon
captain catch you here! He can be very nasty after a full bottle of whiskey.
But that's only if he is awakened from his drunken stupor. So this is one of 
the famous trade ships of Lem-Dagor. It's not very impressive right now, as 
it doesn't seem to have a very valuable cargo at the moment.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

an enormous house blocks the view outside of the city limits.  The house is
covered in large tiles the size of shields.  On closer inspection, their
earthy tones come to light and present a sort of steel/leather material. 
You run your finger across a silver and black metallic tile that seems to
coalesce and keep your eyes from completely focusing on it.  As you back up
a step and take in the full image of what is before you, a chill runs down
your spine as you realize finally what it is that sides this extravagant
house. Dragon scales.  Hundreds of richly colored dragon scales.

  GreyAsh Alley is given its name for its distinctly grey and powdery

you find that, while it is a light, powdery substance, it is attached firmly
to the road.  GreyAsh Alley continues to the south and meets up with

Whitewind Avenue
  The avenue beneath your feet is a pure, pristine white-- unnaturally
white even.  A pleasant wind blows around you, bringing with it the soft
smell of earth and flora.  The smell is light and clean and
revitalizing.  The avenue continues north and south.  To the north the
great city of Aylor expands into its sheer magnificence.  To the south
the gates tower overhead as adventurers old and young make their way
into and out of the city.

to be the Great Tournament of Illoria.  Nearby, you hear melodic tunes
playing, and the mixed aromas of cooked meat and fresh pies fill the air. 
You are glad you came on the day you did - it seems this fair is not to be
missed!

The Refreshment Tent
  You are standing in a huge tent with many tables and chairs.  Many people
are here; eating, drinking, and speculating about which knight is going to
win the tournament.  Near one end of the tent, a merchant is selling food to
the masses.  Perhaps you should indulge yourself in some of the local
cuisine before heading off to watch the tournament.  

[ Exits: south ]
     (Magic) A leather bound book lies here. It's full of poetry, but poems written by trolls are
too deep for most people to comprehend.
(Red Aura) A rich noble woman is here, pondering what she will buy next.
(Red Aura) A very fat wolfen is here, eating all of Olad's food.
(Golden Aura) Olad the Chef is here, preparing food to sell.
Wickens the Wolfen exclaims 'Olad! Olad! Another drink and another bit of meat, if you please!'
Olad the Great Illorian Chef exclaims 'Ho ho, Wickens! You've had quite enough, don't you think?
That's your 15th helping!'
Wickens the Wolfen says 'I have to eat. It keeps my fur shiny, don't you know...'
Olad the Great Illorian Chef exclaims 'You keep eating, Wickens, you won't fit into your fur
anymore!'
Olad the Great Illorian Chef chuckles politely.
Wickens the Wolfen growls at Olad the Great Illorian Chef.  Better leave the room before the
fighting starts.

The Tournament Arena
  You are standing in the huge tournament arena.  A large crowd is sitting
here, watching the knights battle each other in the combat ring below.  You
smile as the crowd cheers every weapon swing, every dodge, and every parry
of the battling knights.  Working your way toward the front, you find
yourself very close to the action indeed.  You could just hop right into the
combat ring if you so wished!  To the north and south, you see more stands
in the arena.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Maids' Room
  The lady commands her servants at all hours of the day and night, so they
have a small room attached to hers.  There are eight small cots lined up
along the walls with a few possessions near by.  Above four of the beds
there are bells.  Other than the beds this room is pretty sparse.  There are
some threadbare hangings covering the walls, and a small stove in a corner
to keep out the chill during winter.

Lady Comfrey's Chambers
  This set of rooms has even more people running every which way
than the kitchen does. The room is huge, even larger than the
lord's. The floor is covered in extremely thick plush carpets
and there are broken art pieces everywhere. The walls are
covered in paintings of the lady herself. A large bed stands
alongside one wall of the room while another wall is completely
covered in mirrors. Above everything you hear a constant screeching
and screaming.

A Spacious Entrance
  This is a spacious entrance to the lady's rooms.  The sound of screaming
is getting louder and there are people rushing in and out of the door to the
north.  To the south there is a long balcony.  The floor is polished wood
and the walls are covered in draped cloth.  You think you see a pair of
small feet peeking out from under the cloth by the wall.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Intersecting Hallways
  Here is where two hallways intersect with the landing.  The floor beneath
your feet is sunwarmed wood and there are not really many walls.  The east
and west lead to wide hallways.  To the south there is a grand window that
overlooks the courtyard.  To the north there is a staircase that will lead
you back to the lower floor.

>>    *[NOEXP]* East Wing
  This is the wing where the lord's room is located.  The screaming noise is 
reduced to a bare whisper once you are this far away.  The walls here are bare 
and the only decor are a few sets of armor and a sword or two on the wall.  The
ground beneath your feet is also stone.  To the north there is a grand door and
to the south is a door leading to the balcony.
