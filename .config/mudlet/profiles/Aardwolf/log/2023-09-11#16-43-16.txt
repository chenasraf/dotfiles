Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  You see a gigantic, translucent crystal rising from the water towards
the unseen ceiling far above you.  The crystal vibrates, and an inner
light makes the air and the water glow in faint rainbow colors.  A low
hum echoes over the black water, as the colors swirl within, forming an
odd pattern.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

the construction is the handiwork of the slaves, directed each step of the 
way by the military. Metal tubing has been twisted and contorted into 
miniature tunnels for the kits to crawl in, on and through. Knotted ropes 
hang from the ceiling for the kits to climb and use for swinging. Gleeful 
shrieks fill the air - evidently, the playground is a great success.

An Underground Playground
  The playground is huge, and continues far to the west and north. Equipment 
has been constructed by the slaves to give the kits something to do during 
the time of preparation for war. Most parents assign their slave to watch 
their children and keep them safe. Many of the kits take this opportunity to 
taunt and tease their slave, unaware how dangerous this could turn out, given
that some slaves might prove disloyal in the end.

The Courtyard of Fort Terramire
  Ah, here we have the friendly face of an invading army.  This courtyard
has been seeded with a grass-like lichen that glows in criss-cross patterns
of eerie blue and green.  The ceiling of the tunnel, however, has been lined
with iron-bound heavy wooden planks to fend off an invasion from outside
(rather ironically).  The firmness of the ground below indicates the same
was done there as well and recovered with earth.

Armor Tent
  As you enter this tent, you notice pieces of leather everywhere. Upon closer 
inspection, it is apparent that the shop is bursting with a large assortment 
of armor that has been adorned with a variety of crests and symbols. Every 
item sold in this establishment conforms with the basic standards of quality 
and performance required by the instructors at this camp. Each piece of armor
has been arranged meticulously. The northern wall of the tent has a rack of 
breastplates; the southern wall has helmets of all shapes, sizes, and styles.
Other armor pieces such as shields, bracers, and gauntlets are aligned on 
tables throughout the tent. The eastern wall sports anatomical diagrams for 
most races, indicating suggested body locations for the optimal use of armor.
A large sign is affixed to this wall.

Polearm Training Tent
  You enter a very large tent which is divided into several venues. Straw 
filled leather bags, resembling potential foes, hang from the reinforced iron
frame of the tent. The floor is smooth, hard-packed dirt. This is the tent 
where students come to learn the effective use of the polearm. The sparring 
area is to the north and, to the east, offensive techniques are taught. The 
clang of iron hitting steel fills the tent.

Artisan Court
  You begin to explore the row of craft shops.  To your north you can hear
the whirling of a lathe coming from the woodworking shoppe.  Bits of sawdust
float through the air and land at your feet.  To the west you see more
vendors; hopefully you can find some nice flowers for the knights in the
jousting arena.

  To the west, you can see the craft area, from which come the sounds of
wood being shaved, and the faint scent of flowers flows through the air.  To
the north, the jousting area and other exciting entertainment begins to
emerge as one draws near.  The faint tinkling of music coming from the same
direction can be detected if you strain your ears.

A dirt road
  Walking along the road it begins to widen out and you can see several log
cabins and various buildings ahead.  Just north of you, you spy what appears
to be a hide factory, the sign hanging over the door shows a picture of an
ermine.  The building looks deserted however, and the door bangs open and
closed in the breeze.  Several windows have been broken out as well and some
of the townsfolk you now see walking about cross the street to avoid walking
near the building.

  Bundles of fur sit stacked here.  Oddly there does not seem to be the
clutter in this room that fills the other rooms.  You even think you notice
a faint drag trail heading north, about the size of a bundle.  Maybe someone
is stealing the ermine furs?  But how?  No one has been seen going in or out
of the factory lately, and there is no way out to the north.  Perhaps you
can figure out the answer to these questions, assuming you can survive the
smell.  Looking around you notice a strange light coming from under some

The latrine
  Well, this is one of the only places you have ever seen with an indoor
latrine.  With all of the nearby woods about, wouldn't it have made more
sense to just walk outside?  Whew, what a smell.  For being deserted there
sure is an awfully strong odor of freshness.  Peering over the hole where
people, umm, do their business, you see nothing but pitch black.  Must be a

excavated some sort of tunnel out underneath of it.  They have also been
using the corner for a bathroom, which explains the stench.  A set of rungs

A strange thin wire extends over the chasm, a small room seemingly suspended
by the wire rests in the center of the space.  You can make out a small
hatch on the room and it's obvious that you can get into the room if you can
walk the wire.  Straining, you can see around the strange room to the other
side.  You know the only way to get there is to walk the wire and go through
the room and then walk the wire on the other side to reach the ledge on the
opposite side.  You grit your teeth, glad you're not afraid of heights, and
calmly step out onto the wire.  It shivers and shakes a second as you adjust
your weight, and a single bead of sweat runs down your face.  Looking back
at the safety of the ledge, you hope this is the right choice...  Wait, what

An underground passage
  There does not seem to be much activity on this side of the cavern. 
Noises echo along the walls but it's impossible to tell where they are
coming from.  At least one good thing about it is that any noise you make is
mostly impossible to tell any difference from the rest of the noise.  You
should not get caught that way at least.  

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: east south ]
A necrophim rages through the passages, gnashing two long fangs.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a

Before the East Entrance (G)
  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark. 
 
The north and south is Sunrise, to the east is the entrance and to the west is
the Slaver's Route and farther down, the market area.

Slaver's Route, Before the Brothel
  The Slaver's Route, almost everyone in the Underdark has walked along
these famous stones.  It was along this road that the city was made. 
Without the slave trade, the city would not have expanded as fast as it did
when the city was first built.  The Underdark has since become a trade
centre where those who dwell beneath the ground and those above can
interact in relative safety.

Slaver's Route
  You stand on the Slaver's Route, so named for the simple reason that the
slavers use this road to transport their merchandise.  The slavers in the
Underdark are renowned for their cruelty, you can tell that this rumour is
true by all the screams of pain and horror that seem to come from all
around you.  The shadows of the city seem to live and breed by
themselves.  Above your head are small floating orbs that bathe the street
with a dim light.

huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

On the Edge of a Forest
  An overgrown path strewn with rotting leaves and acorns leads from the 
Estates into the edge of a forest. The combination of ivy and Mesolarian 
grass here is unusually tall and uneven, prompting warning parchments from a 
purported manorowners association to be left on some of the trees. In some 
places, the undergrowth is so wild and tall that one could lose a sprite in 
it. To the north, the forest thickens, concealing what may or may not be a 
manor. A bell with a rusting waist awaits a ring, but would there be any 
point? It's clear that the owner or owners have not been around in ages...

  An eternal light makes a curious jaunt through the stars in this area,
making it the sort of thing that passes for a road in this vast void.  It
begins near the west side of Onexia Prime, runs past Alya and Reshal, west
from Maia and around Mira to Vagra to the north.  From there, it wanders
west a ways, then southward, going around Kajam to make a stop at Lupus
Majoris and Minoris, then back south and later east, passing Kuma Q'Faile to
complete the circuit.  Lupus Majoris and Minoris are just a bit west of
here, Kajam is to the southeast, and even Furud can be seen from across the
Antipodal Celestial Meridian, making it appear northwest of here.

Before the Moonrift (G)
  Sometimes mistaken for a blue star, this is the entrance to a nexus
created by the three moons of Andolor.  Here the penumbrae of their magics
overlap, creating a passage between Vidblain and another world.  How this
magic works is unclear, but you can always attempt to enter the moonrift if
you wish to find out.

A Ship's Bow (G)
  You are aboard a partially submerged sailing ship that has met with 
misfortune in the Sendhian Sea. The foundering ship is not yet abandoned, as 
all around you, chaos reigns. Sailors of the ship run about the deck, some 
with purpose, and some without. The scene is that of the last few minutes 
before the ship plunges forever into the depths of the sea.

  The cavern is damp, cold and dark. Piles of rubble impede your progress, and 
cause you to stumble. On your knees you see skulls grinning at you, eerily, 
from the piles of detritus. The air stinks of rot, sickening rot that seeps 
into your skin and permeates your gut. A way out is all important now.

  The cavern is damp, cold and dark. Piles of rubble impede your progress, and 
cause you to stumble. On your knees you see skulls grinning at you, eerily, 
from the piles of detritus. The air stinks of rot, sickening rot that seeps 
into your skin and permeates your gut. A way out is all important now.

The Caverns of the Dead
  The caverns, though not deep underground, are bone-chilling in their absolute
cold. No wind blows, and the walls are only damp, not frozen. The air itself,
still as death, carries the cold in the form of spirits floating through the 
caverns and sometimes, passing right through your corporeal form.

  A high rocky outcropping provides a perfect wall blocking the stinging and

almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be

none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a

Unforgiving Heat
  A high rocky outcropping provides a perfect wall blocking the stinging and 
grit of the recent desert sandstorm. Surprisingly, the air now is still, 
almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be
an understatement. A long tall glass of water would be welcome but there is 
none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a 
wish.

A Royal Suite
  The chamber is decorated in gold and silver tones painted into the walls and 
furniture. The bed is spacious, with elaborately embroidered covers, and 
sheer drapes surrounding it for privacy. Fine silk carpets are strewn across 
the marble floor, each a work of art. The sitting area, and the north tower 
beyond it, are east. A small door leads south, almost completely hidden by a 
tapestry that decorates a good portion of the wall.

A Secluded Harem (741)

A Harem Alcove
  What was once a large window faces south here, the interior shutters holding 
fast against the heavy weight of sand outside. The window is set back quite a
ways into the wall, leaving room for a lounging area that is large enough to 
go past a window-seat into a window-bed. An empty birdcage hangs from the 
arched ceiling in front of the window, its door broken off and missing.
Soft, luxurious pillows line the ground and the lounging area, the colorful 
silks having faded with time.
