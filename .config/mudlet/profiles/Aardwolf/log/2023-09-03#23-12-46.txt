Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Woodlands Drive
  The aptly named Woodlands Drive leads in a north south direction, through the
forest. Majestic trees grace each side of the road, their branches reaching 
skyward and their leaves obscuring the sky. Wildlife, both tree dwelling and 
ground scurrying, rustle and tussle through the underbrush and over bush.

  The road runs along the hill side, sloping gently down southwards. Squirrels

On either side of the road, saplings grow at the foot of their mother trees, 
vying for the little bit of light that filters through her branches.

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a

sprayed every which way, wrought iron lies bent and twisted, and obsidian 
stones are scattered about. As a result, walking through here is difficult.
Smoke rises from the rubble through the gates and lingers, making the air 
throughout the caves heavy. Patrols of dark elves wander back and forth 
through the deserted city streets, ensuring they will not lose the city 
proper, or what is left of it.

Entrance to the Temple of the Night
  In order to reach the entrance to the most important building in the dark
elf city, the Temple of the Night, there is a path that heads up a cluster
of stalagmites that have grown together into a strange, gnarly pattern.
The path twists up, and up, and up, through the middle of a massive
cavern. How is it that these stalagmites grew to be so tall, and how lucky
were the dark elves to find a cavern so large? One very likely possibility
is that the dark elves used their magic to create this cavern and all that
is within it. Near the top of the mass of stalagmites, is the temple
entrance. At this point the stalagmites have somehow managed to wrap
themselves around the temple's set of double doors. It is tough to discern
exactly what is going on, because the doors are a glossy black, and the
stalagmites are also black. This setting is the stuff of nightmares. To
make things more confusing, will-o'-the-wisps dance across the scene every
so often, further impeding the ability to discern what is going on by
occluding vision with their bright flash of light. The path is made of
shiny, slippery, obsidian stones, and the temple door is flanked with
imposing statues depicting the handmaidens of the great goddess of the
dark elves. Their goddess is simply known as the Dark Lady, since invoking
her true name is said to bring with it her wrath. The handmaidens are
serpentine, with elven torsos and heads. They wear armor that has been
built from the skulls of the Dark Lady's enemies. The lower halves of
their bodies are like the bodies of snakes, and they also have dragon-like
wings on their backs. Their faces are drawn back in snarls, daring the
uninvited to open the temple door.

Inside the Temple of the Night
  This is no normal temple. Stepping into the Temple of the Night is like
entering into a different type of reality. It is dark as night, and a
sound like whispering seems to come from every direction. Sometimes the
whispers get so close to the ears that it seems as if whatever is making
the sound is hovering right beside them. The shadowy mist that began to
make itself known at the temple entrance is even thicker in here. When it
is so thick that it is difficult to see, a strong floral scent arises,
then the mist always seems to dissipate a bit, but the smell is
overwhelming enough to cause dizziness. The floors in the temple are black
marble, and echo a loud clacking noise with each step an individual takes,
since the temple hall is so massive. Whenever the black fog clears enough
to be able to look around, it is still difficult to see, since it is so
dark. There is a faint light emitting from a source high above, however.
Upon looking upwards to investigate, it is revealed that some sort of
enchantment has been added to the temple to make it appear as if there are
tiny points of light lurking up high in the temple's rafters, like stars.
The swirls of mist move away to reveal statues that depict
gruesome-looking creatures, and other expensive adornments to the temple,
then quickly hide them again, teasing the onlooker.

A Hallway in the Temple
  As an individual travels deeper into the temple, it becomes easier to see 
what is going on inside of it. It's as if the black mist has completed a full
inspection, made a decision that whatever tests that have been run, have been
passed, and as a result, retreated down to the ankles of the curious 
explorer. There are sculptures made from black marble; cast bronze 
sculptures; and sculptures that have been made out of more unusual materials,
like tree trunks and unknown types of rock that glow blue or red. Strange 
large plants grow in the room, emerging right from the floor and twisting 
around the temple's black stone columns. Somehow, these plants manage to not 
crack the black marble floor. What can be seen of the room's great black 
stone columns from beneath these enveloping plants, is covered with 
glittering black and white diamonds that have been fixed to the columns in 
enchanting swirly patterns.

Approaching the Dais
  To the west is the temple's dais. Since everything in this temple seems to be
magnified in size, the dais is raised so high, that from ground level in this
hall, an individual can not even see what the dais floor looks like. This 
makes sense, since dark elves tend to use levitation to engage in all of 
their activities. In case an individual is not utilizing the power of 
levitation, there is a spiraling staircase made from a tree that leads up to 
the floor of the dais. Interesting that the dark elves have used plants and 
trees in this temple, whereas outside in the cave tunnels, they tend to only 
use stalagmites. It is almost like the dark elves are secretly paying homage 
to their ancestors who lived above ground.

Northern Edge of the Dais
  The dais is the most beautiful part of this temple. Enchanted motes of light 
rain down endlessly like stardust and cause a kaleidoscope of color to play 
over the statues and other decorations that are on the dais. The dais has a 
surface made from red marble, causing it to look as though it has been spread
with the blood of sacrificial victims. Fresh-looking black flower petals have
been scattered all over it, and this portion of the dais features three 
larger-than-life, cast bronze statues. The statues depict three of the dark 
elves' most treasured demigoddesses. On the left sits the demigoddess of 
fortune, wearing a wealth of jewels. To the right stands the demigoddess of 
fame, perched upon a pile of skulls and grinning menacingly. In the center 
stands the demigoddess of time, who has been depicted as if she is getting 
ready to smash a sundial with a hammer.

At the Pulpit
  The center of the dais features a statue honoring the Dark Lady. Since the 
Dark Lady does not like to hear her name spoken by mortals, or for them to 
depict her in her true form, the dark elves have created a sculpture of her 
as she likes to appear to mortals when she is feeling especially mischievous.
At these times the Dark Lady enjoys taking on the form of a grotesque-looking
monster, and subsequently scaring all of those who have been disloyal to her.
This is a monster with nothing more than an elven skull for a head, an undead
dragon's body and wings, and a gigantic scorpion tail, complete with a 
venomous stinger. This statue is at least fifteen feet tall, and has been 
created from white marble; in stark contrast with its dark surroundings, and 
therefore the focal point of the room.

Southern Edge of the Dais
  This section of the dais is similar to the other sections, in that the floor 
is made from crimson marble, mimicking the look of the blood of sacrificial 
victims. A six foot long slab of obelisk stone has been placed near the wall 
to the west; this being a spot where, undoubtedly, sacrificial victims must 
make a regular appearance. Upon the wall to the north, a triptych of 
paintings has been mounted. It details the religious history of the dark 
elves, from when they were first saved by the Dark Lady, to the first time 
that she interceded in a major battle that the dark elves were losing, to 
more recently, when she appeared to the dark elves, to bring them new hope.
The dais is dark, but enchanted motes of light fall from an invisible source,
descending until they land upon an object, whereupon they burst into 
nothingness.

Approaching the Dais
  The temple's dais looms to the west. In order to reach it, there is a twisted
tree that winds its way over to the dais's surface, with a set of stairs that
have been meticulously carved into it. The great trunk grows right out of 
the temple's black marble floor, looking every bit as if this is a normal 
occurrence. The tree trunk leads up to the dais, which has been made entirely
out of red marble. Around the tree trunk, drape curtains of blue moss, like 
spiderwebs. The temple is cool, but not as damp at the outside tunnels, so in
that respect, more comfortable.

A Hallway in the Temple
  At this point in the temple, black mist swirls about the wary traveler's 
ankles. Perhaps the mist serves as some sort of security device, since it 
seems to completely dissipate to the west. This section of the temple is 
filled with organic adornments. Many beautiful potted plants have been placed
on slabs of black marble, at varying levels. These plants are all so exotic, 
that they are completely unidentifiable to the uneducated eye. The bulk of 
these plants look a lot like a rainbow of water lilies that sit in dirt 
rather than water, and the others seem to be varieties of mushrooms that all 
glow in the dark. Some of these mushrooms are as large as trees and ooze a 
sticky white substance. The wall behind the plants is covered with a soft 
blue moss, and the floor is made from black marble.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

individual cushioned chairs are provided for visitors to rest after their

The Training Field (1916)

The Pavilion (1915)

The Training Field
  The training field is huge, covering several acres.  This was, perhaps,
optimism on the part of the first Guildmembers who built the base.  The air
is filled with pegasi, dragons, and their human counterparts, perfecting the
skills they're going to need in the upcoming war.  The ground has long since
been packed hard from centuries of traffic by hooves and feet, and the only
grass that grows is at the very edges of the field.  A sheer cliff forms the
western and southern borders, though forest can be glimpsed to the
southeast, and wooden buildings such as the one just west of here have been
built into tunnels in the semi-surrounding mountain.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  For what is essentially a waiting room, this one really isn't too bad. 
It's clean, with torches casting a soft light easy on the eyes.  The wooden
walls have been painted a blue any sky would be proud to wear, so nice and
soothing.  A few tiny trees in ebony tubs occupy the corners, while
individual cushioned chairs are provided for visitors to rest after their
long journey to the Bonded Guild.  Books stand neatly on glass-topped
endtables to entertain as well.  Over it all presides a pretty receptionist
who always manages to remain polite but firm.

enough that three people can walk through it abreast, a torch sconce on the
walls every ten feet or so.  It's more plain than the lobby, the wooden
walls unpainted.  A thin dirt-brown carpet does line the floor in

Lake Kirnas
  The lake deepens quickly, though not so abruptly that one cannot wade
safely into it.  It's large enough that dozens of dragons can go swimming
without running into each other.  The water is a deep, clear blue, and the
rainbow fish that inhabit it can easily be seen as they dart here and there
to avoid capture.  There is no shore other than to the south, for the cliffs
in which the Guild dragons reside start here, curling around the lake before
continuing westward.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

individual cushioned chairs are provided for visitors to rest after their

The Training Field
  The training field is huge, covering several acres.  This was, perhaps,
optimism on the part of the first Guildmembers who built the base.  The air
is filled with pegasi, dragons, and their human counterparts, perfecting the
skills they're going to need in the upcoming war.  The ground has long since
been packed hard from centuries of traffic by hooves and feet, and the only
grass that grows is at the very edges of the field.  A sheer cliff forms the
western and southern borders, though forest can be glimpsed to the
southeast, and wooden buildings have been built into tunnels in the
semi-surrounding mountain.

blending in to the surroundings.  A wide but deliciously clear and cold

  Walking off the beaten path, you seem to have stumbled across an old-looking
log cabin. From here, you can see a large brick chimney; from which smoke is 
rising. You can also see three windows from this view point, although they 
appear to have been blacked-out, for unknown reasons. It is likely the owner 
of the residence does not take kindly to visitors without a welcome. A small 
plaque can be seen hanging above the doorway. The only other exits are to the

You say 'ready'
Mr. Imagi begins casting a spell. You feel light headed.
After a few moments, you fall asleep and find yourself dreaming...

The first stage of sleep
  It seems just like a few seconds ago you were laying in the bed with Mr.
Imagi looking over you. The last thing you recall is a swirling sound as he 
was casting some strange spell; one you have definitely never heard before.
As you are thinking, you hear a loud voice in the distance...

       The voice says 'What did you say you were afraid of again?'

Not sure how to respond, you take a look around and see only a table in
the center of the room. It has a dial on it, pointing to various labels,
and a red button. You wonder, "what have I gotten myself into now?"

Dentalphobia
  Although making monthly trips to a dentist is not only good for your smile, 
it is important for a long life. The list of ill effects of not doing this is
near countless. However, many people fear, even despise, making this monthly 
trip to the friendly person that is the dentist.
 
"So you're afraid of getting your teeth drilled on? Well, not to worry.
 There is nothing of the like here. HA! I had you fooled there for a minute,
 no? Head down and begin taking it like a man, or woman, and your fears of
 sitting in that chair will slowly float away."
 
The only exit, other than leaving this dream, is down.

On a wooden porch before a door
  You are standing before, what appears to be, a quaint little cottage-style 
house. You begin to wonder, why do dentists like to set up their offices in 
small houses? Why don't they just rent or buy a normal building like every 
other business in Andolor? This porch, running east and west, has been 
recently stained, and smells strong. The dentist office lies through the 
doorway to the north.

  This is the main waiting area for the dentist office. Many rows of seats have
been installed against the walls, providing resting places for those who have
been sedated and are recovering, or are waiting to be "serviced". Despite the
fear crippling your body, you manage to spot a sign above:

The reception area
  The reception area for the dentist office is where patients are checked in 
and released once the services have been completed. There's a large desk in 
the center of the room, obviously from where the receptionist performs her

down your spine and nearly wakes you from your slumber! Maybe it would be 
best to let the staff know of the situation.

The first stage of sleep
  It seems just like a few seconds ago you were laying in the bed with Mr.
Imagi looking over you. The last thing you recall is a swirling sound as he 
was casting some strange spell; one you have definitely never heard before.
As you are thinking, you hear a loud voice in the distance...

       The voice says 'What did you say you were afraid of again?'

Not sure how to respond, you take a look around and see only a table in
the center of the room. It has a dial on it, pointing to various labels,
and a red button. You wonder, "what have I gotten myself into now?"

  The sticky heat of the forest forces you to stop for a moment to catch
your breath. The only routes that you can consider for traveling are to
the north and south, everywhere else is covered by trees. You look far
ahead to the south and there seems to be a strange assemblage of rocks.

  Holy smoldering banana peels! It's so hot that you can almost feel your

pour a bucket of water on his head. In its belly is a hole large enough to
crawl through. Time to get out of here!

  You find yourself at the bottom of a hole, surrounded by walls etched
with strange monkey-men art. There are enough climbable spots on the wall
that you think you can make your way to the top, but you don't think you'll
be able to come back down again. Underneath your feet is a huge circular
stone door, carved to look like the face of something really quite scary. 
In its mouth is a hole for a key.

The End of the Pier
  Here, the cargo ship Eleanor Gast prepares to set sail to the island city of 
Rhodus, its hold loaded down with grain. No dockhands are in sight, so the 
ship will probably be leaving port shortly. However, the captain isn't in 
sight either, which is very abnormal. No other ships are docked at this end 
of the pier, so the captain must have gone elsewhere.

Before the Gates of Rhodus
  The Eleanor Gast sits at a pier here before the southern gate of
Rhodus, the only city on the Isle of Molyneux.  The gate, a white marble
archway with no discernable door or portcullis, is an architectural marvel;
fifty feet tall, every inch of the archway covered with sculpture.  Images
of wyverns and gods of the sea dominate, with the occasional war-clad
Molyneuxan or enslaved human figure.  Drug-pacified servants finish
unloading the ship's cargo all around you, but the strange green
tinge to the sky...

A Granary
  Piles of fresh, golden wheat fill this granary nearly to its ceiling.
The only plants grown on Molyneux are poppies, so the Molyneuxans must
import virtually all the food they eat, and the quality of the crafted goods
they produce provides them with more than enough money to do so.  Slaves
from a variety of races constantly carry huge sacks of grain in from the
docks and out to the rest of the city, under the watchful eye of a bound
demon.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand in a training field with wet and muddy grounds.
As you continue down the fields,you realize that 
this was once a battlefield of the worthy and ruthless
but it has now been swept and turned into a training
ground.
Apart from the worn paths and unpleasant pools of mud,
this field is still be used as a training center, and
an older man in a brown uniform who is as tough as

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The End of the Pier
  Here, the cargo ship Eleanor Gast prepares to set sail to the island city of 
Rhodus, its hold loaded down with grain. No dockhands are in sight, so the 
ship will probably be leaving port shortly. However, the captain isn't in 
sight either, which is very abnormal. No other ships are docked at this end 
of the pier, so the captain must have gone elsewhere.

Before the Gates of Rhodus
  The Eleanor Gast sits at a pier here before the southern gate of
Rhodus, the only city on the Isle of Molyneux.  The gate, a white marble
archway with no discernable door or portcullis, is an architectural marvel;
fifty feet tall, every inch of the archway covered with sculpture.  Images
of wyverns and gods of the sea dominate, with the occasional war-clad
Molyneuxan or enslaved human figure.  Drug-pacified servants finish
unloading the ship's cargo all around you, but the strange green
tinge to the sky...

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

Dirt Road
  The trees thin a little and the dirt path angles roughly northward. The path 
has been quite worn down with use. Though you can see the usual bootprints of
human soldiers that like to traverse this area, there is also a marking that 
is not one of theirs. Though it is not paved, this road is well tended in its
usage, except for a section on the east side.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you

  There is an abrupt change in the placid ocean waters.  The skies have
blackened and it seems that there is dark, corrupt magic causing the waves
to crash and churn violently against you.  A helpless feeling overwhelms you
as you find yourself being pulled down into the inky depths below you.

Your mystic might fades away.

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Road Not Taken
  Turning away from the busy street, you walk down a little-used alley and come
to a part of the city that doesn't seem to get a lot of traffic. You marvel at
the sights and sounds as you make your way between the houses and shops. 
Somehow, this area seems even more beautiful than the rest of Aylor. The 
buildings look old, yet you don't remember ever seeing them before. Can there
really be an entire city quarter you just never noticed before?
You make your way through a pair of city gates and out into the countryside.
Breaking away from the main road is a path following along the city wall.
Off in the distance you see a large tower made of three intertwined pillars.
It piques your attention, so you follow the path toward the tower. Eventually,
you come to a road. Though it seems neglected, there is something hauntingly
familiar about it, as if you've seen it in another world. The Granite Highway.

The Granite Highway
  Traveling along the Granite Highway, you notice a striking marble
staircase leading upwards.  Peering along the glorious blue and white 
marble, you can discern a helixed tower rising above you.  Deciding 
that the scenic route would, perhaps, be better than simply walking 
along the same, tired highway, you veer off the stone road and take 
the path towards the brilliant staircase. Wonders past the imagining 
of mortal beings must reside there, and your head fills with images 
of marble staircases, each landing revealing a new landscape or marvel.
The graceful flight of several white doves draws arcs of tranquility 
along the reddish-orange background of the majestic setting sun.  A 
northerly breeze ruffles your hair and makes the deep green grass sway 
back and forth like the gentle crests and troughs of the Dragon Sea.  
You decide to remove your boots so that your worn feet can bathe in 
the essence of placidity that surrounds you.  Thoughts of a utopian 
society enter your tired head, and you slowly drift off to sleep, 
dreaming of a land where all walk hand in hand towards a brighter future.

  This room is dominated by a long counter along one side.  The counter
is made of the same rainbowed marble found elsewhere in the tower,
and appears seamless.  Behind the counter, long rows of shelves line
the walls.  The shelves are packed with bottles, glittering with deeply
jewel-toned potions.  At one end of the counter, a small alembic lies
in a deep wall embrasure.  Written around the arched embrasure are the
processes of alchemy...Calcination, Digestion, Fermentation, Congelation, 
Fixation, Ceration, Distillation, Sublimation, Filtration, Solution,

  The cavernous interior is dark in places and bright in others.  There is 
magic here throughout, with all kinds of affects from colored bands of 
lights to sound dampening walls of silence.  In the center, a giant of a man, 
Ralph Roisterdoister, presides over beer taps.  It is rumored that under the
counter are other types of liquor...or almost anything else one might
desire.  There is a man playing a harp with accompaniment from a dark-haired
woman.  Her voice is captivating, and when she sings, people generally listen.
You head towards the back, where there are several rooms.  It seems Ralph
has branched out into several other trades, having an eatery, shops of many
and various types, gambling dens, and even though it seems out of place, a 
room of meditation.
It seems Ralph runs a clean, honest and fair establishment, and as such it
is packed with people of all sorts, eating, drinking, gambling, talking.

The smith grunts but does not pause his work, a good sign.  You wouldn't want
someone not paying attention to his work, after all.  There is a display area
with things probably for sale:  the usual weaponry, of course.  Some unique
metals are here to be seen.  One vaguely gold colored one that looks like an
unlikely amalagam of bronze and glass.  Various chains, from heavy chains
that could support a drawbridge to a silver neck-chain with links so small
you have to examine it very closely to make sure it actually is a chain.
In another section of the shop is apparently the repaired items waiting
to be retrieved.  Everything from wagon wheels to doorknobs.  Looking closely,
you can't see where the original was broken.  Indeed, this smith is skilled.
The smith turns to you inquiringly, after motioning an apprentice to
keep working the bellows.  You drag out a prized possession, a mithril-like
chain mail shirt.  It isn't exactly mithril, nor anything else any smith so
far has been able to identify.  Regardless, you show the broken clasp made
by some long ago smith.
The smith nods his acceptance and tells you that he can fix this, better
than the clasp on it now.  You agree on a price and leave, satisfied.

     A blunted wooden sword used in training lies here collecting dust.
A towering figure of earth labors resiliently here by a forge.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  You step down from the marble floor of the temple and find yourself on well 
worn steps cut into living rock that are lit by magic orbs reflecting light 
from a myriad of glittering gems. As you reach the bottom, you find a long 
cavern leading east and west. In the centre of the floor is a large rock, 
glittering with hieroglyphics formed from green gemstones. Perhaps you should
look at the rock!

Expedition Hut (G)
  The crawlway empties out into a large chamber.  Every visible surface is
covered with items guaranteed to make exploration less hazardous.  Some of
the equipment is quite strange, as if the pieces were all handcrafted from
different parts of the realm.  Everything seems to fit neatly into small
fissures in the room's stalagmites and stalactites.  One wall is lined with
exotic potions that quietly bubble away, ready to assist explorers. 
Organizing everything into place is a young man.  Approaching you, he seems
almost ageless.  You wonder if the gems you have seen around possess a power
you can not fully understand.  Examining your equipment, he asks What can I
do to aid you in your travels?

Expedition Hut (G)
  The crawlway empties out into a large chamber.  Every visible surface is
covered with items guaranteed to make exploration less hazardous.  Some of
the equipment is quite strange, as if the pieces were all handcrafted from
different parts of the realm.  Everything seems to fit neatly into small
fissures in the room's stalagmites and stalactites.  One wall is lined with
exotic potions that quietly bubble away, ready to assist explorers. 
Organizing everything into place is a young man.  Approaching you, he seems
almost ageless.  You wonder if the gems you have seen around possess a power
you can not fully understand.  Examining your equipment, he asks What can I
do to aid you in your travels?  

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: north east south west ]
The Spelunker Outfitter rises from behind the counter to assist you.

Senior Explorers Hut
  Upon entering this chamber, you notice that everything seems as if it has 
been carved from quartz sandstone. The stalactites and stalagmites glitter in
the reflected light. The equipment stored within vibrates with energy that 
strains to be set free. Stepping out of the rock, a humanoid shaped elemental
moves to face you and then waits for you to make your selection.

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: north ]
Stepping from the rock an Earth Elemental manifests here.

Expedition Hut (G)
  The crawlway empties out into a large chamber.  Every visible surface is
covered with items guaranteed to make exploration less hazardous.  Some of
the equipment is quite strange, as if the pieces were all handcrafted from
different parts of the realm.  Everything seems to fit neatly into small
fissures in the room's stalagmites and stalactites.  One wall is lined with
exotic potions that quietly bubble away, ready to assist explorers. 
Organizing everything into place is a young man.  Approaching you, he seems
almost ageless.  You wonder if the gems you have seen around possess a power
you can not fully understand.  Examining your equipment, he asks What can I
do to aid you in your travels?  

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: north east south west ]
The Spelunker Outfitter rises from behind the counter to assist you.

A Gemstone Studded Staircase (G)
  You step down from the marble floor of the temple and find yourself on well 
worn steps cut into living rock that are lit by magic orbs reflecting light 
from a myriad of glittering gems. As you reach the bottom, you find a long 
cavern leading east and west. In the centre of the floor is a large rock, 
glittering with hieroglyphics formed from green gemstones. Perhaps you should
look at the rock!

The Eastern Cavern
  The tones of organ music from the Aylorian Temple of Ivar are muffled here. 
As you head east from the bottom of the Staircase, the cavern walls seem
to glow with the sparkle of innumerable multi-coloured crystals. A forest
of rocky spires grow from the cavern floor, ancient stalagmites solidified
by the years into a rock-like hardness.
You see light spilling from a small cave beyond the spires to the north, and
a sense of wonder and anticipation urge you to enter the cave that promises
a wealth of wondrous things.

  Almost hidden behind a maze of rocky spires, you find a small cave. Looking
around, you see numerous sharp stone shards, of various hues, interspersed 
among flexible lengths of magically entwined gems. Hovering before you is
a crystalline sprite shimmering in a myriad of colours. It lands upon a nearby 
rock and awaits your decision.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

  As you walk on, you come to the point where the path seems to suddenly
end.  Yet, it also seems the path begins again.  You ponder this apparent
contradiction for a moment, but then realize that it is not a contradiction
but rather a point of balance.  There is a sudden flash in your mind as this
realization strikes you.  The ground seems to sing, and worlds turn about
your head.  All of your ideals, conceptions, and knowledge flow through your
mind and to seem mean nothing at all.  Suddenly, all is still.  Your mind is
suddenly a blank page with nothing written on it, and you sense the inherent
beauty in this.  You pause for a moment and then resume your journey
exploring Tao.

Atrium of the Collective Mind (G)
  
You have come to a place free of the concept of time.  This is the
Collective Mind, a magical place formed from the enlightened ideals of Tao,
so true and strong that it has become a tangible place within the realm. 
The large spherical dome above you shimmers with the precipitation of
thought; it seems to be formed of intricately threaded ideas and mist. 
Suddenly, it is not a dome at all anymore, but a starry night sky.  And
then, it changes into a clear blue tapestry with the sun hanging overhead. 
In the background to the north, you see a cyan river flow alongside a
granite path that seems to ponder the very meaning of existence as you step
upon it.  As your mood shifts, the hues and saturation of this place seem to
change accordingly.  The followers of Tao move about in the background, so
seamless with nature it is as if they flow with the breeze and move with the
water.

  A vast marketplace opens before you.  From one edge of the horizon to the

assortment.  Each vendor's face is uniquely recognizable, yet none are
completely memorable.  Volumes upon volumes of shoppers peruse the wares
within each stall, and a plethora more crowd the throughways between stalls.
Your mind happens upon the idea of a trinket you desire; without a second

The Jade Palace (G)
  Pushing aside the canvas of the marketplace stall, you see a small stone
path leading toward a widening blue expanse.  The scent of salt and seaspray
fills the air.  Your steps continue blindly toward and then beyond the edge
of the surf, never wandering from the stone path that continues before you. 
Completely dedicated to following this path, your mind does not even pay
attention to the fact you are soon completely submerged.  Moving unharmed
through the depths, you soon find your destination, before you stands a
palace made entirely of jade.  Pushing the magnificent doors open, you are
overcome with awe at the majestic view of the palace interior.  The center
of this fortress boasts four statues, each a representation of one of the
four Dragon-Kings, facing their relevant cardinal direction.  You are
entranced by the statues' beauty, but are taken aback as your eyes wander
and come to rest upon the shrewd gaze of the Eastern Dragon-King sitting in
the far corner of the room.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered

  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

Armchair Avenger Clan Hall (G)
  This is where old farts come to hang out and complain about how much
better things were in the old days, when there were only three mobs in the
entire MUD, and one of them was Ivar.  You can still hear the faint whining
of issues no one actually cares about any more and the ghosts of inactive
players pop in from time to time to mutter something about all the damn
newbies.  There is a painting of Ivar on the mantle over the fireplace that
all the rocking chairs are crowded around.  In spite of all the chairs here,
most of the people in this room appear to be off their rocker.  
 
There is a recently unearthed stone tablet here (look tablet) on display.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

Boot Clan Public Hall (G)
  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Help Keywords : 'Cancellation' Negation.
Help Category : Miscellaneous.
Last Updated  : 2023-01-21 19:57:05.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax: cast 'cancellation' <character>  Spell Number: 10
Syntax: cast 'negation' <character>  Spell Number: 195

This spell attempts to remove magical effects from the target.  It can only
be used on yourself, pets you own and other players; it is not an attack
spell.  

Cancellation works best on benign spells, but will have an effect on harmful
spells as well.  The higher your Intelligence, the greater chance you have of
successfully canceling spells.  Permanent affects (such as racial abilities
or those given by quest equipment) cannot be canceled.

If you do not wish to allow others to cancel your spells, use the 'nocancel'
toggle.

Primary stat: Intelligence, Wisdom.
Affected by : Luck

help blindness
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Blindness.
Help Category : Attack Spell.
Related Helps : Burnt Marbu, Cure Blindness.
Last Updated  : 2017-07-15 18:02:18.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax: cast blindness <target>
Spell Number: 6

This spell quite simply renders the target character blind, in a very
effective and lasting fashion. A character that is affected by blindness
(whether through this or other skills/spells) has a lower chance to hit in
combat and will find it much harder to dodge and parry incoming attacks.

Primary stat: Intelligence.
Affected by : Luck.
