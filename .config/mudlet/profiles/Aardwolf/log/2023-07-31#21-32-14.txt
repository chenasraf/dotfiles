Ancient Room
  You are standing in a large stone room.  Feels like a crypt.  Ancient
murals of Hell and punishment cover the walls.  In the middle of the room
are stairs that lead down in to the darkness.  From the stairway you can
smell brimstone and sulfur.  To the west it looks as if there is a shrine.

Dark Stairway
  You are standing at the bottom of long dark stairway.  The smell of
brimstone and sulfur choke you.  Screams of pain and terror fill the air. 
Stone faces carved into the walls seem to laugh at you.  Maybe this is not
such a good idea after all....

Bits of ash and burnt vegetation cover everything.  The walls and floor are

  Rows of beef and other meats hang from large steel hooks.  You notice

the east.

Bard Clan Hall (G)
  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through

lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the

The lobby (G)
  The sheer size of the theatre's lobby is breathtaking. Tall marble
columns support the ornately carved dome ceiling, and the walls are adorned
with playbills from previous and future shows. This is where the crowds
gather before the show, and where they wait out intermissions with lively
discussions. The continuous low, humming drone of conversation is 
occasionally punctuated by loud, boisterous laughter coming from the large
group of people congregating near the entryway. On the southern side of the
room stands a towering pair of arched double-doors leading into the
theatre. Ushers stand ready, programs in hand, to show you to your seat.

Entrance to the Crusader Clan Temple (G)
  It takes you only a few seconds to realise that this is no ordinary temple 
building. There is a constant flow in and out of the temple of people and 
goods. As you watch, a shipment of shining white plate armor is carted into 
the temple doors. Not long after, a group of noble knights exit the temple 
accompanied by the blare of trumpets to honor the start of a new crusade 
against evil. You notice a friendly knight standing near the large arch 
leading into the temple who appears to be directing all newcomers to various 
sections of the temple. You are convinced that your stay here will be a 
blessed one.

A Towering Waterfall (G)
  A towering waterfall soars above the surrounding forest and continues
as a river flowing towards the east. The constant roar of falling 
water pounds your ears as chaotic mists spiral, twist and turn about 
you. The light from The Three Moons - Nuitari, Lunitari and Solinari - 
create a dazzling array of colors which invade your senses. Yellows,
violets, reds and blues fade into one another and together with the 
chaotic mists create a reality void of definition, form and substance. 
While searching within the mists of chaos, you are able to hear the 
faint sounds of music pierce through the roar of the falling water. 
Following the sounds to the far end of waterfall, an ancient stone 
structure emerges from the mists.

Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.
