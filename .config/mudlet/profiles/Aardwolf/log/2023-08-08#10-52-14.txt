Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
In the Main Castle Kitchen
  You feel bile rise in your throat as you enter the castle kitchen.  What
ungodly thing the chefs are preparing, you are not sure that you want to
know.  Everywhere on the floor, you can see piles of bones, some freshly
gnawed, and pools of damp, sticky blood.  From just around the corner, you
hear a blood curdling shriek, abruptly cut off with a heft 'THWACK!  - They
must be preparing the main course...

  You are passing from the raucous atmosphere of the dining hall, into the
raucous atmosphere of the kitchen.  Unpleasant smells waft out, causing your
nose to shrivel, and your stomach to turn.  Heaven know what they are
cooking in there, but do you REALLY want to find out?  Demons bustle past
you, back and forth, carrying plates full of disgusting muck, surely they
can't be about to eat THAT??

  Harried servants, backs bent double under the weight of dirty dishes
shuffle through the dining hall.  With the constant influx of diners, their
work is seldom finished.  The diners take little notice of the servants as
they attempt to keep some order about the tables, usually taking no more
notice of the poor creatures other than to shove them out of their way... 
The poor shoved creature more often than not ending up on the floor under a
mass of broken dishes and leftovers.

corruption of many different creatures, twisted together into a mocking
semblance of their former lives.  All around the edges of the courtyard,
large archways vault upwards, calling you into their maw.

  Dread magics have warped and twisted the stone, shaping the slabs into

It appears that no form is too corrupt, no evil too twisted for these vile

  This part of the castle seems to be subtly different.  The architecture
has taken on a much more functional look, not the gothic, spires and arches
of before, but something altogether more practical.  Black marble has given
way to slate grey stone, closely cobbled within the walls.  Weapons also
adorn the walls, looking well looked after and very sharp.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

In a Misty Swamp (G)
  Standing knee-deep in the murkish water, you feel the curious sensation
of unseen creatures slithering against you.  The soft ripples trailing
across the water are rythmically entrancing, but you blink back to reality
when you see the reptilian creature which forms the ripples.  With a shiver,
you move on, wanting to be out of the mist-laden swamp.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

Syntax: fire

Lulled by the promise of a hot meal, some hearty tunes and that life-
giving warmth, the Fire skill will enable a character to rest and sleep
more effectively. It costs 100 moves to build a fire, and due to the
fact that firewood is sometimes sparse, they can only be built in wood,
hill or mountainous areas.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

  You have greatly enjoyed your journey through Sargasso, the underworld,
and this mysterious town/castle, but now all that is behind you.  You stand
in front of the diamond door to the throne room, where you can at last meet
Queen Angelina, whose grace and wisdom you have heard much about.  Your heart
starts to race with excitement, and you want to tear down the door just so
you can see her more quickly.  You will yourself to calm down however, and
take time out to think of what you will say to her.  As you ponder this
important question, you admire the statues of the queen that guard the
throne room like angels of eternity.  They were sculpted from pure diamond,
but their eyes are aquamarine, their staves sapphires, their halos topaz, and
their fingernails rubies.  Its almost as if Queen Angelina summoned the
powers from all corners of her realm to protect her throne room from hatred
and destruction.  Taking a deep breath, you finally realize what you will
say to her and decide to open the door.

Inside Diamond Castle (1063)

Inside Diamond Castle
  Two tapestries woven of pure silken threads grace the diamond walls of
the hallway, each depicting a turning point of not just the castle, but of
the whole city as well.  Crystalline suits of armor line the walls,
absorbing the light then dispersing it in a prismatic spiral.  The
chandelier hanging from the ceiling has no candles with which to
illuminate the corridor, yet it gives off a tranquil radiance which urges
you to release all your pent up hatreds and phobias.  Your eyelids slowly
drift downwards as you fall into a deep healing trance.  Here, above all
other places, you feel safe.  

[ Exits: east (west) ]

  After opening the diamond gate and entering the castle, your senses are
overcome with amazement and wonder.  Even the inner walls of this
magnificent castle are made of diamond.  As you step across the floor, the
shock of your feet smacking the ground is absorbed, and instead of making a
cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which
separates the rest of the castle from the arborium, and to the south is the
castle dining room.  The castle hallway continues east.

Inside a strange city (1061)

Talcum Way
  Talcum Way (which is covered with Talcum powder, believe it or not)
extends north here.  Your boots don't make the "crunch, crunch" sound that
you expect, but rather you hear a pleasant swishing sound, similar to a
broom of feathers brushing across a tile floor.  You close your eyes and let
the peaceful sounds overcome you.  You feel lighter than air, almost as if
you could float away into the clouds.  Two very decorative mansions lie to
your east and west: one made of jade, the other of opal.  To your north is a
very ancient library.

  The huge stack of books continues unchecked in this part of the library. 
It appears that you can check out library materials here, if they interest
you enough.  A stack of returned books is at your right, yet to be
organized.  You chuckle to yourself as you realize how long it will take the
staff to reorganize all those books, as there must be literally over one
million books in the whole place.  To make matters even more hectic for
them, there is no real system of organization, so who knows where the books
REALLY go.  This must be a bigger pain in the butt than it is worth.

Inside Pumice Library
  Bookshelves spiral upwards towards the seemingly endless ceiling.  Normal
citizens and scholars alike congregate here to do but one thing: learn.  To
this end, sapphire tables are scattered about the library, and each is
completely crammed with people reading, examining, and poring over the
contents of some book or other.  Seeing how engrossed people are in their
reading, you mosey over to one of the bookshelves.  Three particular works
catch your eye: "Planets and You", "The Life and Times of Queen Angelina",
and "Melosa's Wish".  How fascinating!

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

In Black Cat Tower (G)
  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

Mushrooms and snails
  The tall, leafy hedges tower over the grassy path, casting deep shadows and 
cooling the air noticeably. The dark green leaves are almost black in the 
perpetual shade and mushrooms grow in abundance, lending their own unique, 
pungent odour to the area. A couple of snails creep along ground, leaving 
silver slimy trails in their wake.

Rustling hedges
  A rustling of the leaves coming from the hedge beside you indicates you are 
not alone. The source of the commotion cannot be seen, but sounds like 
something small pushing its way through the internals of the leafy hedge. A 
small red apple sits at the base of the hedge, almost lost to sight.

coming from the nearby hedges, but you cannot see the actual source.

Tall hedges and soft grasses
  So many corridors in the garden maze look the same, the hedges are tall and 
dark leafed and, for the most part, pretty well kept. The grasses are spongy

Rustling hedges
  A rustling of the leaves coming from the hedge beside you indicates you are 
not alone. The source of the commotion cannot be seen, but sounds like 
something small pushing its way through the internals of the leafy hedge. A 
small red apple sits at the base of the hedge, almost lost to sight.

Mushrooms and snails
  The tall, leafy hedges tower over the grassy path, casting deep shadows and 
cooling the air noticeably. The dark green leaves are almost black in the 
perpetual shade and mushrooms grow in abundance, lending their own unique, 
pungent odour to the area. A couple of snails creep along ground, leaving 
silver slimy trails in their wake.

  The dirt under the hedges is a little churned up and muddy. There is a group 
of worms oozing in and out of the mud under the safety of the leaves. The 
grass nearby is squishy and little puddles of water form momentarily in the 
footprints left behind. A trio of black and orange butterflies dance along 
the dark hedges, sparkling in the sunlight.

Nature's perfume
  The leaves on the hedges wave around a little in the light wind that also 
brings the perfume of numerous flowers with it, tickling the hairs of your 
nose slightly. A stray autumn leaf drifts past you, slowly floating backwards
and forwards as it gets closer and closer to the green grass, to lay there 
unmoving. A grasshopper, startled by the leaf's appearance, springs away in a
graceful bound.

  Tall hedges with dark green leaves line the path through the maze. The soft 
grass is a vibrant green and smells fresh and crisp, as though after a light 
sun shower. The grass is spongy and quick to bounce back, leaving no visible 
footprints. Quite out of place amongst the green of the path is a 
beautifully formed autumn leaf, which matches the liquid amber tree in the 
centre of the garden.

comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry

like music to the ears.

Dirty disturbances
  In a quiet corner of the garden maze there looks to have been a recent 
commotion in the hedge, like something has been using it as a place to hide.
While, for the most part, the grass is soft and spongy, the ground underneath
the hedge is bare dirt. There is definitely signs of a disturbance on the 
ground and some of the lower branches seem to be broken off. Perhaps it is 
worth investigating ...

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

one has to duck to enter, and only some ragged blankets to provide comfort,
it does have one precious advantage- it's a place to hide from those that
would do its occupant harm.  And there are many, many of those.

  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous

Pandemonium Marketplace
  Easily the busiest place in the city, the Pandemonium Marketplace is a
broad square of flagstone easily covering half an acre.  Not only shops are
available here, but kiosks can be, and are, set up as well.  Every item
imaginable is available here, and at all hours of the day and night.  The
buzz of deals being struck can be constantly heard, interspersed with a
shout now and then as those dickering get a bit excited.

  Small but tasteful, this courtyard is on the small side.  Surrounded by a
wall of black marble blocks, it holds a few stone benches and a withering
tree here and there.  It tends to be quiet, as few stop here for very long
on the way in or out of the Jewelled Palace.  Torches flicker in their
sconces, but never die or need refreshing, and the dim light they cast
reveals long narrow apertures in the surrounding wall.  Just the thing to
shoot arrows through at anybody foolish enough to invade the castle.

  Ballroom, receiving hall, and court, all in one.  Every inch of the
marble walls has been covered with carved sheets of extravagantly expensive
dark wood.  The face of Prince Belial himself has been carefully notched
into the ceiling, reminding all those below that they are in his domain. 
The hall is rather large, spacious enough to hold a hundred demons, and only
the finest Damned brick comprises the floor, making sure that footsteps are
quiet and unobtrusive.  Nooks and crannies are provided for those who
require privacy in their conversations, and there is never a lack of the
finest wines and fanciest hors d'oeuvres provided for the guests of the
ruler of Orcus.

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...

  Sweet perfume wafts with every movement here, enticing and tantalizing. 
Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic
lord.

  Oddly, perhaps, this is the most peaceful place in all of Pandemonium. 
Unlike some courts, in which nobles and citizens alike do not hesitate to
scream out their opinions and protests, King Lucifer's is maintained with
quiet decorum.  This probably has something to do with the fact that
violators of this rule are likely to find their heads on a spike.  Even
honor combat is forbidden in this grand hall built of simple stone and wood.
The King and his Princes each have a permanent throne here, around which are
usually clustered petitioners.  Lucifer's, of course, towers over the rest,
though the statues carved of stone, each depicting one of those nobles, are
more colossal than anything most demons and Damned ever hope to see.

An alcove
  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its
walls are lined by smaller pillars that you saw in the hall.  In the center
there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.

The lightside of the coin
  Staring out across the edge of the citadel you can see the land of
Aardwolf whisking by.  You can hear the joy and feel the warmth from within
the small town that lies to the north.  Looking up into the clouds, past the
city, you see the goal of this journey.  Somewhere in that tower lies the
relic you seek.

A back alley
  The way you came is now gone and you find yourself in a back alley.  The
alley walls are high and too flat to get any traction to climb.  The ground
has garbage on it; luckily not much light gets back here so it is not
rotten.  Noises come to you from the opening leading from the alley into the
main part of town.

The top of the tower
  You have finally reached the top of the tower.  Looking around you see
four gargoyles sitting on each corner of the roof.  Clouds stretch in all
directions from there onwards.  The most peculiar thing in the room,
however, is a small coin with one side in the light and one in darkness.  Of
the artifact you are looking for there is no trace.  Where could it be?  

[ Exits: north ]
     (Magic) This side of the coin is bathed in light.
     (Magic) This side of the coin is clouded in shadows.
A stone gargoyle sits here on the corner of the roof.

  You're dead center in the field.  The animals seem to like you.  All you
can see for a hundred yards is waving wheat and animals.  You've never quite
felt this close to the earth and yourself.  It feels great.

  Here, the wheat isn't waving-- it's bent over by the force of the wind. 
You look to the east and see the source of the wind: a giant tornado which
doesn't seem to be moving.  You ponder whether to investigate or to run back
to the farmhouse.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:

  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

near to it, casting shadows so deep that odd glass balls filled with glowing
insects have been set on poles to provide illumination.  It's when you reach
the gates of the palace itself that you spot a sign that might explain the

The Palace of Queen Jula (G)
  The Dharivian palace is truly a marvel to behold.  No doubt, the
tyrannies of Queen Jula must have included severe taxes to pay for the
furnishings here.  The walls are plated in pure gold, with trimmings of
glistening silver, and precious jewels were used to form murals on the
walls.  These pictures, of course, portray the Queen at her most beauteous,
as a conquering hero and gracious ruler.  You find the Queen herself holding
court in the main hall, mounted on a throne carved from emerald, high above
everybody else on her dais.  Oh, well.  Better luck next life.

  The deathberry hedges of Dharivian are famed throughout the world.  Not

berries, but they can easily be shaped into all sorts of forms.  In this

corridors.  The branches lace together overhead, forming a roof a hundred
feet high, and the passages are wide enough that several giants could walk
abreast.  You can see nothing but green and the occasional splash of scarlet
berry in every direction.

impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through, and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From

A Bloody Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Blood plentifully spatters the fine, soft grass
underfoot and you might wish to hold your breath until you are well away
from the rotting odor rising from it.  A nervous glance around reveals eyes
gleaming in the shadows, as well as what might be a glint of steel.  Do you
really want to remain here for long?  After all, you can still head north or
south to continue your escape efforts.

quality, as if something large and heavy passed over it, compressing each
blade into the ones around it.  It's so comfortable that it is something to
keep in mind for when (if) you ever get back to civilization.  You could
probably make quite a bit of gold stuffing it into shoes for those who spend
all day on their feet.  It does put quite a bit of spring into your step. 
Speaking of steps, you can head north or south from here.  After all, you
have to get out before you can make a profit.

has been cleared of the poisonous deathberries, and beneath a weeping willow
tree a little campsite has been erected.  Okay, so it's a large campsite, to
judge from the huge shelter that has been constructed of deadfall wood. 
Pieces of cotton batting the size of watermelons, the kind used in stuffed
animal toys, apparently serve as pillows.  They look more comfortable than
anything else in the maze; perhaps you have time for a quick nap before

homemade tents have been constructed from the skins of various creatures
and racks of drying meat are placed strategically so a breeze won't carry

  The labyrinth continues.  A stiff breeze blows in this section of

fear-induced sweat and blood.  Isn't that encouraging?  Not.  At times it

hiding the shrubberies in shadows.  Those poisonous scarlet berries still

way along carefully, you probably won't trip over the odd bumps and lumps
you can detect on the ground.  One of them gets your attention, though, when
it tries to wrap around your ankle.  A shlupping sound reveals that similar

centaurs has taken up residence, the adults trying not to let the foals know
they are all prisoners.  For the most part, they succeed, but explaining the
occasional disappearance of one of their number in a flurry of fur and blood

tiniest bit of light, enough to let one's eyes adjust to the dark and see
enough to prevent most stumbles.  The deathberries still shine brightly,

a frantic prisoner.  The branches, though, being as hard as iron, or harder,
resisted all but a few shallow cuts.  The powerful blows that must have been
inflicted on the shrubbery limbs may be, in one way, reassuring, or at least
informative.  If something that had the ability to even scratch the

A Freezing Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  The yielding grasses are thick here, albeit
easily pushed aside and the imprisoning hedges warped as they escaped the
Queen's magic and grew rapidly at their own pace.  One can take a deep
breath here freely, feeling as if a weight has been lifted from one's chest.
An eerie sound disturbs the comfort here, though, in a loud, haunted wail. 
The temperature drops suddenly, fingers of ice wrapping round one's soul.

  The labyrinth continues.  The grass here is tacky and the odor of drying
blood immediately informs one of the reason for it.  Of course, the nasty
stuff cannot be seen too well in the dark, perpetual night in this part of
the maze.  Obviously, though, battles have taken place here and one would
be wise to keep a weapon ready at all times.  One never knows when an ambush
might suddenly make itself known.  Luckily, there are several paths of
retreat available, to the east, south, and west.

  The labyrinth continues, believe it or not, despite the fact that in the
darkness, it's impossible to say just how far it goes.  An odd odor like
soured milk wafts up from the magically clipped grass, making one's stomach
turn.  One can hear some definite and loud wailing, like that of a child
lost far from home.  Of course, it wouldn't be surprising to find such a
creature in the labyrinth of the cruel Queen Jula.  If one wishes to
investigate, there are available and barely perceptible paths to the north,
east, and south.

>>    A Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From
here, you can head east or west in your effort to escape.

him out of the darkness when nothing was there.  One can stumble along to

  The labyrinth continues.  It's green here.  Not just green, but very,
very green.  We are talking about the ultimate green of all time.  In this
stretch of the maze, even the deathberries are green, though they seem large
and ripe.  The color probably wouldn't be so overwhelming if there were some
variation in shade, but alas, the darkness has turned everything a dark
green matching the color of pine needles.  Yuck.  Three paths are available

  The labyrinth continues.  Despite the unending darkness, one immediately
can come to the conclusion that flowers abound here.  The scents of roses,
carnations, lilies of the valley and a blooming lilac tree blend into a
heavenly fragrance.  Jarring that sensation, though, is a loud buzzing that
vibrates right through to the bone and a strong breeze as if a cadre of
eunuchs were waving ostrich fans.  There doesn't seem to be a harem around
here though.  One could check out the notion though, to the east or the

Yep, this is the center of the maze. It's here that the Queen's magic is
strongest. The ground is bare rock without even a dusting of soil to
cushion footsteps, and every inch of the hedge walls are crowded with spiky
thorns. It's painfully bright here, enough to make one shade one's eyes,
though the source of the light is a mystery. In the very center of this
denuded patch of stone, a tall stake has been thrust deep into the ground.
Around it grows a special breed of deathberry bush, in the form of climbing
ivy that's a lot tougher than it looks. It also grows around the victim
chained to the pole, inflicting just enough poison to torture the poor man.

occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in

thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be

huge oak tree is planted directly in the center of the corridor, its lofty

reach.  What you can hear is a frail soprano voice singing a soft, sweet
lullaby.  It is rather soothing, despite the fact that making one's way
through the vastly overgrown grass in this darkness is difficult at best.

  The labyrinth continues.  Even the gleaming deathberries can barely be
detected along the black line of thorny hedge surrounding the corridor.  An
odd clacking noise makes itself known, like the sound of a beak snapping
furiously.  This notion is borne out by the soft, tiny feathers littering
the short grass.  A very close squint will reveal they're a pretty nut brown
in color.  No blood mars the feathers, so most likely something around here
is molting.  The trail of feathers leads both north and west.

  The labyrinth continues, at least in one direction.  It is rather dark
here, the hedges fading into grey and black shadows.  For some reason, the
temperature is rather high here, drawing sweat from those who venture into

into removing heavy armor, but only a truly foolish adventurer would do
something like that here.  Maybe the maze will be cooler to the east.

  The labyrinth runs into a dead end.  It's rather moist here, the
deathberries glistening more brightly from the water dripping from them.  A
fine mist stretches along the corridor, making the air thick, though not
impossible to breathe.  It's probably not recommended to drink from the
moisture on the hedges, though - who knows what poison it may have picked up
from the treacherous shrubbery?  You can make your way through the mist to
head back west.

A Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues in dark evening light.  No matter how far you go,
everything looks the same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder
than iron and impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is
tight enough that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through
and an occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet
in thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long
sharp thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to
be neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.

>>    A Flowery Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  There are signs here of a magic at work here
other than the Queen's.  This is one of those spots in the maze where her
magic has weakened, as evidenced by being much brighter than the passages
around it and grass and bushes grown wild.  However, flowers bloom here of a
type not found in any other part of the maddening labyrinth, large lovely
blossoms of pink and soft blue that release an enticing aroma.  An odd blue
light reflects off the nearby deathberries, turning them a luscious violet
against the green hedges.  All in all, it's a rather relaxing place.  It
almost seems a pity to have to continue the effort the escape the maze.

>>    A Trampled Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Here the deathberry hedges have actually taken
a little bit of damage - broken branches are just as dangerous as the sharp
thorns that protrude from the greenery, their poisonous sap oozing a vomit
green.  The grass has also been flattened, as if a heavy weight had been
left on it overnight.  Perhaps one of the giants that inhabits the maze
makes his bed here?  Or perhaps something even larger...  Should you care to
go find out, you can head north or south.

  The labyrinth continues.  The fine, soft grass of the maze has been
burned away, the bare earth below baked into flinty toughness.  The
deathberry hedges around here have suffered the same fate, their branches
hardened and bare of greenery.  The smell of smoke still lingers, and if
touched, those branches inflict at least a second-degree burn.  Hanging out
here probably isn't good for one's health and there are escape routes to
the north, south and west.

the most comfortable - the soft, fine grass is even thicker here, providing a
comfortable bed as well as pillow stuffing, if one is so inclined to create
such.  Only a few deathberries can be glimpsed in the dusky gloam here and
the air is filled with a lovely scent, as of roses.  A twittering of
birdsong floats into the corridor from the hedges.  If you decide to move
on, you can head north, south, or west.

part of the maze, as the grass has gone somewhat out of control, as if the
Queen's magic were weaker here.  The only deathberries in sight are those
that have burst and released their poison, rendering them harmless.  Still,
the hedges have overgrown as well and there are a lot more thorns to avoid
here.  Let's see... from here, you can head north, south, or west into the

  The labyrinth dead-ends abruptly.  The hedge walls to either side simply
grow together suddenly, erecting an impenetrable barrier of shrubbery as
hard as iron.  Above, the thorny ceiling seems higher than usual, but that
could be a trick of the lack of light.  The smell of bitter bark fills your
nostrils, but it's somewhat quieter here in this little cul-de-sac.  The
only direction to go from here is east.

battle has left dark blood drying on the deadly shrubbery.  Bits of bone and

care where they step.  Somewhere nearby, a creature cackles maniacally,
sending a chill down your spine.  Yep, this is definitely not a place you
want to be, you're fairly sure of that.  The sound of gnashing teeth drives
you to check the corridors, and you find you have three options -  north,

A Comfy Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Here, the soft grass takes on a thicker, spongy
quality, as if something large and heavy passed over it, compressing each
blade into the ones around it.  It's so comfortable that it is something to
keep in mind for when (if) you ever get back to civilization.  You could
probably make quite a bit of gold stuffing it into shoes for those who spend
all day on their feet.  It does put quite a bit of spring into your step.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The world famous Master Questor of Aylor hands out quests to adventurers.

world.  Private and no-recall rooms may not be gated into, and you may not
leave a no-recall room via the gate spell.

Additionally, attempting to cast this spell towards monsters which are
sufficiently more powerful than you, any player level 200 or higher, and 
any player with nosummon on, will fail.

A skilled wizard can create an object that is an exact clone of another,
though the power that goes through it when it is created makes it weaker,
and it fades to dust after a time.  Items that are magical in nature are
impossible to clone.

This spell allows the caster to make a magical copy of a wide range of
objects within the realm. Objects created with this spell tend to last
longer than those made with minor creation.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

  This part of the castle seems to be subtly different.  The architecture
has taken on a much more functional look, not the gothic, spires and arches
of before, but something altogether more practical.  Black marble has given
way to slate grey stone, closely cobbled within the walls.  Weapons also
adorn the walls, looking well looked after and very sharp.

side, you can see the swamp, fading off into the ever present mist.  To the
other, there is the courtyard, a hundred feet below you.  A high wind tears
at you, threatening to push you off and plunge you to the stones, far below.
It is as if here, you could touch heaven, were hell not so close and ever
present...  

[ Exits: north south ]

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.
