Emerging from the Woods
  The remains of the woods disappear to the south, opening up into a small 
field to the east. The field is surrounded on all sides by trees. A stone 
path leads off to the east, and it is covered with stone and dirt. Be careful
where you step.

ominous silence pervades the area. Yellow eyes stare at you from the

The Intersection of Fate
  This is the Intersection of Fate. This is where you choose how you will 
proceed. Will you decide to depend entirely on fate, fortune, or greed? The 
path continues to the east and west while a small trail continues to the 
north. The mouth of a large cave lies to the south, but it is too dark to see
inside.

  The rocks beneath the surface have created large rapids. The rapid currents 
attempt to smash you against the rocks while the undercurrents seek to draw 
you beneath the surface. The water foams as it smashes against the rocks. It 
isn't safe to stay here, perhaps you should swim to the calmer waters to the 
north or south.

A Landing Area
  This small beach provides an excellent spot to stop and enjoy the weather.
The fine pebbles and sand of the beach provide a soft, comfortable place to 
lay down. Some nearby trees provide you with shade as well as large boulders 
alongside the stream. The river disappears underground to the north so you 
couldn't have travelled along it further anyway. A path begins to the north.

Syntax: drop <object>                   : Drops an item.
        drop <amount> coins             : Drops gold.
        get <object>                    : Picks up an item.

        give <amount> coins <character> : Gives a character gold.
        put <object> <container>        : Places an item into a container.

'drop' will drop an object, or coins, to the ground.  You may substitute
'coins' for 'gold'; both arguments act the same way.

WARNING! Dropping items on the ground is never 100% safe- do so at your own
risk, or find another method for important items.  See 'help reimburse'.

'get' will retrieve an item, or gold, from the ground, a container, or a 
corpse. The synonym 'take' works exactly the same way.

'rget' works in the same manner as 'get', but will target items in the room
first, rather than what's in your inventory.  For example, 'rget item bag'
with a bag in inventory and one on the ground will get the item from the
bag on the ground.

'give' will give an object to another player or monster.  Items that are
kept (see 'help keep') cannot be given to monsters.  To give gold, use the
syntax 'give <amount> gold <player>'.

'put' will put an item into a container.  It will try to put the object
into a container in inventory first, then into a container in the room.
It is not possible to put gold or other containers (unless the container
contents weigh 100% of their normal weight) into another container.

You may use '<number>.keyword' to specify one particular item out of 
multiple items with the same keyword.  You may also use the syntax
'all.<keyword>' to give, get, drop, or put all items with that keyword at
once.  For example, if you carry a long sword and two short swords, 'drop
2.sword' will drop the first short sword.  'put all.sword bag' will put 
all three swords into a bag.

On the Steps of the Temple
  You are standing at the entry to the temple. A red cross has been painted on 
the door. Sounds of crying echo out from the temple. The onyx steps have an 
ominous feeling to them, as if the darkness is calling to your soul. Smoke 
pours out of the temple doors, disappearing into the air. Do you dare enter 
the temple and discover what darkness lies within?

The Path's End
  This is the end of the path. There is no other path to follow as it leads 
right up to the steps of the temple to the north. Statues line the path here,
and their eyes seem to follow you pleading for release. A hissing sound comes
from somewhere behind the statues.

The Marble Path
  The path is made of carved, hand-laid marble blocks. Each block was 
meticulously laid so that they form small designs, and that each stone is in 
its perfect place. Trees line the path forming a natural canopy above the 
path while rays of sunlight peek through the trees.

  The path is made of carved, hand-laid marble blocks. Each block was 
meticulously laid so that they form small designs, and that each stone is in 
its perfect place. Flowering trees drop bits of their petals on the ground, 
creating a perfect cushion for your feet.

Syntax:  adopt <keyword>        : Adopt a pet from a pet store.
         adopt <keyword> <name> : Adopt a pet and give it a custom name.
         pets                   : Lists pets which are following you.
         nofollow <petname>     : Use nofollow to get rid of your pet.

You can only acquire a pet by using magic, a skill, or adopting low-level 
pets at the various pet stores around Andolor.  Pets will follow you and 
assist you when you fight. You may only have one pet at a time.

The 'PETS' command will show you which pets you have, and where they are.

To buy a pet in a pet shop, type 'list' to view the list of pets and then:
 
    adopt <keyword>        : Adopt a pet, using its default name.
    adopt <keyword> <name> : Adopt a pet, using a new name for it.

Note that pets are not allowed in most parts of Aylor, and that it is
usually not a good idea to bring a pet when you are on a quest.

Pets can do many things players can do.  Simply use 'order <pet> <command>'
to order a pet to do something.  Note that not all commands work with pets.

Pets can wear equipment, but only up to half their level and they cannot 
wear clan equipment. Just give the equipment to them, and order them to
wear it.  Beware! It is not recommended to give them equipment you care
about losing. If your pet lands a killing blow, the gold looted from the
mob will be lost.

To make a pet stop following you, type 'nofollow <name of pet>'.  To make
a pet stay where it is, order it to sleep/sit.  To make a pet return to 
you, use 'heel'. (This will not work in 'prison' flagged rooms.)

Pets only stay with you while you are in the game and will disappear when 
you quit.

If you are trying to use a social and see this command's output instead,
prefix the social with * to use the social.  See 'help socials'.

You may play the games in the Games tent, but they will cost you 100 gold
coins each time you play.  The odds of winning depend on the type of game
played, and that's really because the chance of winning is completely
random.  To play one of the games just give the man or woman 100 coins.  You
type it exactly like "give 100 coins man/woman" without the quotation marks.
Have fun and remember to save some money for the cab ride home.  And remember,
these games are probably rigged.

 details about the people who walk into his tent!"
The Badger Handler reaches out and pats the cage, quickly snatching
her hand back as the badger viciously tries to remove it at the wrist.
The badger handler says, "Yes, indeed, this little sweetheart can
 accurately guess anything about you.  So, what do you want?  Your choices
 are Weight, Intelligence, Strength, Gender, Dexterity, Quests Completed,
 Mobkills, Gold, Luck, or Tier.  If you need the list again, just type

Just as you think you can't take anymore, the nasty little thing
pops out of your shorts, hops back to its cage, and whispers something
to the Handler.
The badger handler says, "Manny estimates your tier at a rather
 conservative -26."
The Handler looks at you inquiringly, and sighs as you solemnly
shake your head and provide a certificate of suckitude from the Newb
Association of Aylor, which proves your tier higher than -26  She sighs,
digs around under the table, and comes up with your prize coupon.
You receive a prize coupon from the badger handler.

Despite his mistake, Manny still looks rather satisfied.

In order to play the Crossbow Shoot, you will need to purchase
a temporary crossbow from the Crossbow man for 100 gold or one
game coupon.

When you have the crossbow, you will need to aim crossbow,
which is the signal for the duck to come down the line.  At this
point you will need to shoot duck.  If you're lucky, you'll
hit.  If you're unlucky, you won't.  You need to hit five ducks
to win.

 which will drop a basket from the surface for the fish to feed out of -
 for example, you can type 'feed goldfish' to feed any goldfish that might
 be in the room.  To give everyone a chance, we ask that you only feed each
 type of fish once - and remember my warning about the shark!  If you're
 going to feed him, we recommend you do it last, because he'll get playful,
 and that's not always best for your health - if you get what I mean!"

 what you're supposed to be doing, just type 'help' in any of the Scuba
 Dive rooms, and you'll get a list of instructions.  Good luck, and enjoy

 and will attempt to hit another bumper car (or the wall, in some cases!). 
 But remember, we all need to play nice."

The bumper car operator exclaims, "If you get stuck, or can't remember
 what you're supposed to be doing, just type 'help' in any of the bumper
 car rooms, and you'll get a list of instructions.  Good luck, and good

mold, but it's still a disturbing sensation.  You do, however, get
the rather insane urge to shake one of the heads to see if the
brains are still inside.

shake one of the heads
Well Lit Hallway
  You are standing in a well lit hallway.  This hallway looks as if it has
been cleaned recently.  

[ Exits: north east ]
As you pick up one of the fleshy heads and begin to shake it,
the teeth suddenly clack together and the eyeballs twist in
their sockets to glare at you.  A hissing, sibilant voice emanates
from the decaying mouth, and ancient curses fill the air as tongue
chunks splatter over you.  You drop the skull hastily and dash from
the room, to find yourself in a bright, clean hallway.  Better not
to trust this, however - you should probably creep north from here.

Well Lit Hallway

they have been swept there.

You're not sure what's going on, or why there are clean and
well-lit hallways in a spooky house..but it's beginning to make
you nervous.  You're sure what's waiting ahead must be far worse
than what you've already seen.  All you can do, however, is creep
west and find out what's next on your list...

Room of Bones
  You are standing in a room filled with bones of all shapes and sizes. Some of
the bones look centuries old.

[ Exits: east south ]
A fake plastic skeleton hangs on a rope here.
You creep into the room and stare around at the piles and piles
of bones...it's clear where the remains of the decaying body parts
go when they're no longer useful in a fleshy condition.  As you peer
into the empty eye sockets of a skull, you hear a rattling behind you.
Whirling around, you see the bones forming themselves into full skeletons,
assembling themselves into lines and beginning a stately waltz.  One
lonely looking skeleton stands at the end, seeming to look around
forlornly.  Perhaps you should dance with the skeleton?

  You are standing in a room filled with a hazy mist which is glowing
strange colors.  You can also smell something sweet and spicy at the same
time.

A small furry brown bat flies around here.
A fake plastic skeleton hangs on a rope here.

You bow politely to the skeleton and whirl off into a stately
waltz, undanced in centuries.  As your steps lead you past the
southern doorway, the skeleton's eyes suddenly blaze with a red
light, and it spins you into a wild spiral, flinging you south.
You barely avoid hitting the doorframe, and look around to find
yourself in a rather odd room.  At first you think you're still a
bit dizzy from the dancing, but eventually you realize the surreal
surroundings are actually part of the room.  You have trouble
focusing on the walls, and realize your chore here is to find
the exit.

A corpse wrapped in tattered robes is here looking for its sarcophagus.
A smelly rotten corpse stands here staring at the wall.
You cautiously feel along the wall, looking for exits.  After
one false start, and another near waltz with the skeletons, you
find an exit that leads into another hallway.  The hallway is
a strange place, and you have a feeling if you stay here too long
you'll join the corpses in the body parts rooms.  The best thing
to do here is creep south.

ready to be out of here.  Better rush south before it gets

You're back at the beginning!  You feel as if you could possibly
get more out of the house, if you really wanted to - or maybe not,
the sounds of screaming are loud from the north.  If you feel up to
it, you might creep east.

The stoned tortoise is now at the 1/4 point marker, but the drunk hare
is still nowhere in sight.  The stoned tortoise stops and takes a deep puff
off a small cigarette looking thing, stares into space for several minutes, and
continues plodding on its slow way.

 the hare is off the board!  He's off the board!  Yessir, this is still
 anyone's race, it is indeed!"

The stoned tortoise continues plodding his way along, slowly passing the

of the drunk hare as it bounces across the track, stops to take a swig
from a flask it pulls out of...somewhere, and then bounces off again, swearing
like a sailor.
The Pet Race Supervisor exclaims, "And the tortoise is at the halfway
 point, making his way around the curve!  The hare is still out of sight,
 it might be near the end, it might be out of the country!"

The stoned tortoise slowly comes around the final curve, heading for the
3/4 point marker, where it stops and pulls out a bag of tortoise snacks.
The drunk hare comes screaming down the track, running the wrong way.
It stops again, pulls the flask out (you still can't tell where it's pulling
it from) and takes another long swig.  Then it's off again!
The Pet Race Supervisor exclaims, "And the tortoise is at the 3/4 point,
 right onto the final curve!  The hare made a brief appearance, bounding
 down past the 3/4 mark on its way to the 1/2 way point!  It's still up for
 grabs, folks, it could be anyone's race!"

And, on the final curve, the stoned tortoise sits down and begins playing
with its toes!  The drunk hare bounces past the stoned tortoise,
staggers past the final five feet, and passes out just over the finish line!
YES!  We have a winner, folks!  The Race Supervisor leaps over the counter
and seizes your hand, shaking it wildly!
The Pet Race Supervisor exclaims, "What a race!  What a race!  And you're
 a winner, kid!  Congratulations!"

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time

At the Town Gates of Dharivian
  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

  The deeper you penetrate this large town, the more you get the feeling
that something is terribly wrong here.  Even in the thickest crowds, not a
single pickpocket has made an attempt at your gold, and you haven't even
seen any beggars.  The towers of the royal palace loom larger as you draw
near to it, casting shadows so deep that odd glass balls filled with glowing
insects have been set on poles to provide illumination.  It's when you reach
the gates of the palace itself that you spot a sign that might explain the
paranoid behavior of the populace.

The Palace of Queen Jula (G)
  The Dharivian palace is truly a marvel to behold.  No doubt, the
tyrannies of Queen Jula must have included severe taxes to pay for the
furnishings here.  The walls are plated in pure gold, with trimmings of
glistening silver, and precious jewels were used to form murals on the
walls.  These pictures, of course, portray the Queen at her most beauteous,
as a conquering hero and gracious ruler.  You find the Queen herself holding
court in the main hall, mounted on a throne carved from emerald, high above
everybody else on her dais.  Oh, well.  Better luck next life.

The Entrance(?) to the Labyrinth
  The deathberry hedges of Dharivian are famed throughout the world.  Not
only do they bear heavy clusters of fruit in the form of luscious, poisonous
berries, but they can easily be shaped into all sorts of forms.  In this
case, the magic of Queen Jula has forced the shrubbery into long, enclosed
corridors.  The branches lace together overhead, forming a roof a hundred
feet high, and the passages are wide enough that several giants could walk
abreast.  You can see nothing but green and the occasional splash of scarlet
berry in every direction.

  The labyrinth continues.  As you make your way through the maze, the
sounds of its denizens become a little noisier.  It seems that the farther
you go, the more strange and exotic beings you find.  Here, a few branches
of the poisonous shrubbery are bent, as if a very strong creature was
determined at some point to break free.  The tough greenery held, though,
probably resulting in little more than sore muscles for the hapless
prisoner.  From here, you can make your way south or west in your efforts to
escape.

control, as if the Queen's magic were weaker here.  It's long enough to
reach knee-high on a centaur, and one can detect paths that have been
trampled down by creatures passing through it, though they seem kind of
narrow.  Despite the fact that no little glowing glass ball floats here,
there's an unmistakable brightness in this length of the maze.

quality, as if something large and heavy passed over it, compressing each
blade into the ones around it.  It's so comfortable that it is something to
keep in mind for when (if) you ever get back to civilization.  You could
probably make quite a bit of gold stuffing it into shoes for those who spend
all day on their feet.  It does put quite a bit of spring into your step.

have to get out before you can make a profit.

underfoot is sticky with a clear slime that clings to you whenever you touch
it.  It glistens in the light of of a buzzing, glowing glass ball, no doubt
put here to allow the Queen a better look at her entertainment.  Somehow the
berries in this part of the labyrinth don't seem quite as appetizing. 
Poison is bad enough, but tacking on dripping slime is just gross.  If you
head north or south, you can probably get out of this stretch of corridor
before your gag reflex kicks in.

  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron, and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From
here, you can head north or west in your effort to escape.

  The labyrinth continues.  The stink of manure is strong here, but the
shrubberies and grass have benefited from the loathsome stuff.  The branches
of the deathberry bushes are harder here than anywhere else in the maze, and
the grass underfoot is lush enough to make even the best groundskeeper
jealous.  Just be careful where you step, lest you end up tracking manure
throughout the labyrinth.  Not that it would hurt the maze any, but fresh
whiffs of the odor are probably best avoided.  From here, you can head

A Littered Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Here is another portion of the maze where
battle has left dark blood drying on the deadly shrubbery.  Bits of bone and
skin have been flung far and wide, and those with no footwear should take
care where they step.  Somewhere nearby, a creature cackles maniacally,
sending a chill down your spine.  Yep, this is definitely not a place you
want to be, you're fairly sure of that.  The sound of gnashing teeth drives
you to check the corridors, and you find you have three options -  north,
east, and west.

An Overgrown Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  It's not quite so easy to move through this
part of the maze, as the grass has gone somewhat out of control, as if the
Queen's magic were weaker here.  The only deathberries in sight are those
that have burst and released their poison, rendering them harmless.  Still,
the hedges have overgrown as well and there are a lot more thorns to avoid
here.  Let's see... from here, you can head north, south, or west into the
rest of the labyrinth.

A Comfortable Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  This particular section of the maze is one of

comfortable bed as well as pillow stuffing, if one is so inclined to create
such.  Only a few deathberries can be glimpsed in the dusky gloam here and
the air is filled with a lovely scent, as of roses.  A twittering of
birdsong floats into the corridor from the hedges.  If you decide to move
on, you can head north, south, or west.

A Scorched Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  The fine, soft grass of the maze has been
burned away, the bare earth below baked into flinty toughness.  The
deathberry hedges around here have suffered the same fate, their branches
hardened and bare of greenery.  The smell of smoke still lingers, and if
touched, those branches inflict at least a second-degree burn.  Hanging out
here probably isn't good for one's health and there are escape routes to
the north, south and west.

lot easier to spot the yellowed bones of animals scattered down the length
of this corridor and avoid tripping over them.  Grizzled grey tufts of
coarse fur have been captured by the deathberry thorns, and large pawprints
have been embedded in the bare earth.  From here, you can head east or

  The labyrinth continues.  Here, in the center of a thorny corridor, is a
tasteful circle of oak trees.  Most seem fairly young, but the one in the
center is huge, obviously centuries old.  Its branches wave slightly,
despite a complete lack of breeze.  Acorns litter the soft grass and moss
growing over roots where they protrude from the ground.  The topmost limbs
brush against the shrubbery ceiling overhead.  If the sun shone here, this
ancient tree would provide excellent shade almost all the way to the lengths
of the maze to the north, east, and west of here.

burned away, the bare earth below baked into flinty toughness.  The
deathberry hedges around here have suffered the same fate, their branches
hardened and bare of greenery.  The smell of smoke still lingers, and if
touched, those branches inflict at least a second-degree burn.  Hanging out

the north, south and west.

thorns that protrude from the greenery, their poisonous sap oozing a vomit

left on it overnight.  Perhaps one of the giants that inhabits the maze

A Corridor of Silken Dark in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  It's getting progressively harder to see
anything, though the deathberries clearly remind one of their presence.  The
darkness has an odd sheen to it though, as if it were composed of ebony
silk.  There is a definite aura of strange magic to it, something that jars
one's senses.  Murmured chanting can be heard, making one's hair stand on
end.  If one wants to flee, paths to the north and west are available.

which is not at all encouraging when one hears odd scritchings and
scrabblings all around.  To judge from listening carefully, whatever is
making them is rather large too.  Another oddity here is the large
amber-colored feathers scattered about on the ground.  They are over a foot
long and very wispy, glowing against the dark green of the grass.  From
here, you can head into the darkness to the east or to the south.

  The labyrinth continues.  Thank the gods, the glowbug globes hover here,
providing some weak light to see by.  An odd chattering can be heard, very
quick voices babbling, but the sound is maddeningly low and words cannot be
discerned.  It is very high-pitched in tone and quickly becomes rather
grating.  One could almost become more anxious to escape the sound (assuming
it's not madness inflicted by the maze) than to escape the labyrinth itself.

the...  Oak?  Weeping willow?  Maple?  It's rather hard to discern, until

  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From

fastidiously combed until it all leans in the same direction.  The branches
of the deathberry hedges gleam brightly, polished to a high shine and one
can't find a more dirt-free berry than right here.  Somebody must have been
very, very bored.  No doubt you are not, however, and you can head north or

undulating rather than sharply straight.  Granted, it makes for a much
smoother appearance to the walls of shrubbery, but it doesn't change the
fact that they still form a prison.  One can head east to get back into the

A Dead End in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth comes to a sudden dead end.  This is, perhaps, the darkest
of the local corridors, although worse darkness can be found even deeper in
the maze.  The deathberry hedges here show signs of being hacked, perhaps by
a frantic prisoner.  The branches, though, being as hard as iron, or harder,
resisted all but a few shallow cuts.  The powerful blows that must have been
inflicted on the shrubbery limbs may be, in one way, reassuring, or at least
informative.  If something that had the ability to even scratch the
poisonous plant could not make a dent, perhaps it's not so bad that you
cannot do it even that much.  In any case, one might head south, if he or
she were trying to escape the labyrinth.

A Dead End in the Labyrinth
  Once again, you find a dead end in the labyrinth.  No matter how far you
go, everything looks the same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are
harder than iron, and impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough
wood is tight enough that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze
through and an occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be
several feet in thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining
ceiling, long sharp thorns discourage climbing.  The only possible direction
to go from here is east.

  The labyrinth continues.  Even the gleaming deathberries can barely be
detected along the black line of thorny hedge surrounding the corridor.  An
odd clacking noise makes itself known, like the sound of a beak snapping
furiously.  This notion is borne out by the soft, tiny feathers littering
the short grass.  A very close squint will reveal they're a pretty nut brown
in color.  No blood mars the feathers, so most likely something around here
is molting.  The trail of feathers leads both north and west.

A Dome in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  This is, in fact, the largest part of the maze.
Instead of a long corridor, though, the hedges form a sqarish, domed chamber
easily twice the width of any other passageway in the labyrinth.  The soft
grass has been trampled flat, testament to the high number of creatures that
pass through here every day.  Or is it night?  In any case, four large
archways, to the north, east, south and west, lead further into the maze.

A Decorated Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  After a bit of groping along the hedge here,
it might be realized that the carved shrubbery has been cleared of its spiky
thorns.  Instead of pricking a finger, one can detect...  Ribbons?  Yes,
after close examination, that's what they are - brightly colored ribbons,
interwoven into the mesh-like branches of the deathberry bushes.  It seems
somebody has been doing some redecorating.  There are two paths one can
follow from here: one to the east, and one to the south.

An Impossibly Dark Intersection in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Making one's way through the inky blackness,
one starts to become accustomed to the darkness.  One's hearing seems to
become more sensitive, every tiny stirring in the maze is startlingly loud. 
The advantage to the lack of light is that it makes you difficult to find
for the creatures prowling the labyrinth in search of fresh meat.  At least,
you hope so.  Groping fingers discover there are passageways leading north,
east, and west.

mention the dangerous creatures living here.  It doesn't help to realize
that the passages narrow abruptly as well, to half their previous width.

It's Not Easy Being Green
  The labyrinth continues.  It's green here.  Not just green, but very,
very green.  We are talking about the ultimate green of all time.  In this
stretch of the maze, even the deathberries are green, though they seem large
and ripe.  The color probably wouldn't be so overwhelming if there were some
variation in shade, but alas, the darkness has turned everything a dark
green matching the color of pine needles.  Yuck.  Three paths are available
for the taking, to the north, east, and west.

impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From

  The labyrinth continues, believe it or not, despite the fact that in the
darkness, it's impossible to say just how far it goes.  An odd odor like
soured milk wafts up from the magically clipped grass, making one's stomach
turn.  One can hear some definite and loud wailing, like that of a child
lost far from home.  Of course, it wouldn't be surprising to find such a
creature in the labyrinth of the cruel Queen Jula.  If one wishes to
investigate, there are available and barely perceptible paths to the north,
east, and south.

of the deathberry hedges gleam brightly, polished to a high shine and one
can't find a more dirt-free berry than right here.  Somebody must have been

this particular stretch of the maze, an obstacle lives in the form of a
large tree-like form.  One might swear to a feeling of being watched by
the...  Oak?  Weeping willow?  Maple?  It's rather hard to discern, until

not seem inclined to move along the corridors to the east and west.

grating.  One could almost become more anxious to escape the sound (assuming
it's not madness inflicted by the maze) than to escape the labyrinth itself.

An Overgrown Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The long, tangled grass is growing wild in this
stretch of the maze, as if the Queen's magic were weaker here.  From here,

Off in the distance you can hear a faint, raucous call; it seems to be
coming closer, the noise penetrating your bones.  Maybe finding a place to
hide would be a good idea; something like the mass of interwoven twigs over

long, sharp thorns protruding from the imprisoning hedges.  Even in the
darkness, though, here they are easier to spot.  Tufts of grey fur have been
caught on the thorns, making them more detectable as well as cushioning the
spiny points.  Now all you have to do is avoid tripping on the withered
corpses flung round on the grass, faces frozen in expressions of terror. 
Presumably you don't want to join them, so you can head north or east.

straining one's eyes.  Those bright scarlet deathberries shine though, their
venomous fruit glowing with an inner, magic light.  They look mighty
tempting, attested to by the various bird carcasses laying near the hedge
walls.  Needless to say, the odor in the air here is nauseating.  Want to

growing over roots where they protrude from the ground.  The topmost limbs

and tangled, it makes passage difficult.  The deathberry bushes, as well,
have escaped the magic that keeps the hedges straight and sharp.  Oddly,
it's easier to breathe here, and this little corner of the maze seems to be
a refuge of sorts.

A Stinky Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  The stink of manure is strong here, but the
shrubberies and grass have benefited from the loathsome stuff.  The branches
of the deathberry bushes are harder here than anywhere else in the maze, and
the grass underfoot is lush enough to make even the best groundskeeper
jealous.  Just be careful where you step, lest you end up tracking manure
throughout the labyrinth.  Not that it would hurt the maze any, but fresh
whiffs of the odor are probably best avoided.  From here, you can head
north, east, or west in your efforts to escape.

A Dead End in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  The ground shakes now and then, as if a
massive being nearby is stomping along the maze corridors, and not even the
fine, soft grass underfoot can cushion the giant footsteps.  A quiet corner
has been cleared of the poisonous deathberries, and beneath a weeping willow
tree a little campsite has been erected.  Okay, so it's a large campsite, to
judge from the huge shelter that has been constructed of deadfall wood. 
Pieces of cotton batting the size of watermelons, the kind used in stuffed
animal toys, apparently serve as pillows.  They look more comfortable than
anything else in the maze; perhaps you have time for a quick nap before

with an inappropriate merriness.  Despite the sheltering earthen walls, the

A Camp in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  In the shadowy corridors, you stumble into a
makeshift camp.  In a pit carefully cleared of grass, a small bonfire burns
with an inappropriate merriness.  Despite the sheltering earthen walls, the
flames twist the shadows into strange, leaping shapes.  A quartet of
homemade tents have been constructed from the skins of various creatures
and racks of drying meat are placed strategically so a breeze won't carry
the smell.  All in all it seems a well-organized little camp, albeit of
crude construction.  But that's not surprising, considering the
surroundings.  When you are ready to leave, the corridor continues to the
east and west.

An Overgrown Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Despite the dim light here, the greenery has
grown wild and unchecked.  Huge trees have developed, growing many times
faster than normal and this stretch of grey-green corridor resembles thick
forest more than a nice, neat maze.  Sounds of wildlife are everywhere and
small brown rodents can be seen zipping around the foliage.  It's not easy
getting through the thick greenery, but the fact that you feel refreshed
here helps quite a bit.

At a Pond in the Labyrinth (G)
  The labyrinth continues.  This stretch of the thorny corridor is a
little bit wider than the norm and faint trails have been worn through the
short grass, though the dirt beneath isn't quite revealed.  It appears to be
a major thoroughfare for the denizens of the maze.  Dark yellow goo puddles
here and there, but while it doesn't look particularly appetizing, at least
there is little odor emanating from it.  The small pond, however, is crystal
clear and clean, offering a refreshing drink.  Here you have a choice of
three pathways - one to the north, one east, and one southward.

A Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From
here, you can head north or east in your effort to escape.

A Small Valley in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth does not continue.  Actually, here the corridor leading
into this part of the maze broadens into a small valley surrounded by the
ubiquitous hedges.  It is a dead end, but a refreshing change from the
endless rows of deathberry bushes.  It's here that the Queen's collection of
centaurs has taken up residence, the adults trying not to let the foals know
they are all prisoners.  For the most part, they succeed, but explaining the
occasional disappearance of one of their number in a flurry of fur and blood
isn't quite so easy.  When you finish watching their antics, you can head
west back into the rest of the labyrinth.

the deathberries are coated with a fine misting of frost.  The temperature
here definitely dips into an uncomfortable zone, but the hedge branches
remain as hard as iron.  Things may be more comfortable to the south or

variation in shade, but alas, the darkness has turned everything a dark

it might be realized that the carved shrubbery has been cleared of its spiky
thorns.  Instead of pricking a finger, one can detect...  Ribbons?  Yes,

Princess Zanya exclaims, "My mother has shackled and abandoned my love, my
 poor Yelsem, somewhere in this maze.  He will die of exposure if someone
 doesn't find the key to his shackles and free him soon!"

Princess Zanya sits down and thinks deeply. 
Princess Zanya says, "If there is anyone in the labyrinth who can help you
 find the key, it is the Sphinx.  If I only knew where he was, I would ask
 him myself!  If you find him, please give him this,as a token of my
 respect."

A Stinking Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  It's amazing how one's sense of smell develops
when one's eyes are useless in the unending dark.  An acrid, sour odor rises
abruptly, strong enough to make one cough, eyes watering.  Those who have
owned a pet kitten that ignores its litter box will recognize the odor
immediately.  Something feline is around here marking its territory. 
Hopefully it's a very small feline.  Maybe you'll run into it by heading

a flash of nauseating green can be detected right in front of your nose,
then it whisks away.  Presumably you'd like to get far away very fast, so
you can feel your way along to the north, east, or south.

that can be seen here.  By now, at least, one should be accustomed to
feeling along the hedges safely, without impaling hands on the poisonous
thorns.  An exotic perfume floats on the air, a sexy and exciting scent. 
What an odd thing to find in such a place.  One could go north, south, or

  The labyrinth continues.  Adventurers seeking to escape from the Queen's
maze may have considered that freezing the imprisoning hedges might make
them breakable.  Guess again.  Icicles hang from the shrubbery branches, and
the deathberries are coated with a fine misting of frost.  The temperature
here definitely dips into an uncomfortable zone, but the hedge branches
remain as hard as iron.  Things may be more comfortable to the south or
west, if one ignores the snarls and growls that can be heard.

very green.  We are talking about the ultimate green of all time.  In this
stretch of the maze, even the deathberries are green, though they seem large
and ripe.  The color probably wouldn't be so overwhelming if there were some
variation in shade, but alas, the darkness has turned everything a dark
green matching the color of pine needles.  Yuck.  Three paths are available
for the taking, to the north, east, and west.

difficult now to avoid the dangerous deathberry thorns all around, not to

Yep, this is the center of the maze. It's here that the Queen's magic is

cushion footsteps, and every inch of the hedge walls are crowded with spiky
thorns. It's painfully bright here, enough to make one shade one's eyes,
though the source of the light is a mystery. In the very center of this
denuded patch of stone, a tall stake has been thrust deep into the ground.
Around it grows a special breed of deathberry bush, in the form of climbing

  The labyrinth continues.  It's not quite so easy to move through this
part of the maze, as the grass has gone somewhat out of control, as if the
Queen's magic were weaker here.  The only deathberries in sight are those
that have burst and released their poison, rendering them harmless.  Still,
the hedges have overgrown as well and there are a lot more thorns to avoid

Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

Mesolarian Grassland
  Open and flat, the grasslands of Mesolar cover much of the continent.  In
many places, one can walk for days without seeing a single tree or hill. 
This wide expanse of flat land has an abundance of life, however; rabbits,
badgers, foxes, and mice are just a few of the types of animals one can
expect to see out here.  Also, there are many wild grains and edible plants
which the animals and nomadic peoples of Mesolar can easily find and make
use of for food.  Many adventurers should find the foraging easy enough as
well.  To the east a small town has grown up on the plains.

  The deeper you penetrate this large town, the more you get the feeling
that something is terribly wrong here.  Even in the thickest crowds, not a
single pickpocket has made an attempt at your gold, and you haven't even
seen any beggars.  The towers of the royal palace loom larger as you draw
near to it, casting shadows so deep that odd glass balls filled with glowing
insects have been set on poles to provide illumination.  It's when you reach
the gates of the palace itself that you spot a sign that might explain the
paranoid behavior of the populace.

The Palace of Queen Jula (G)
  The Dharivian palace is truly a marvel to behold.  No doubt, the
tyrannies of Queen Jula must have included severe taxes to pay for the
furnishings here.  The walls are plated in pure gold, with trimmings of
glistening silver, and precious jewels were used to form murals on the
walls.  These pictures, of course, portray the Queen at her most beauteous,
as a conquering hero and gracious ruler.  You find the Queen herself holding
court in the main hall, mounted on a throne carved from emerald, high above
everybody else on her dais.  Oh, well.  Better luck next life.

The Entrance(?) to the Labyrinth
  The deathberry hedges of Dharivian are famed throughout the world.  Not
only do they bear heavy clusters of fruit in the form of luscious, poisonous
berries, but they can easily be shaped into all sorts of forms.  In this
case, the magic of Queen Jula has forced the shrubbery into long, enclosed
corridors.  The branches lace together overhead, forming a roof a hundred
feet high, and the passages are wide enough that several giants could walk
abreast.  You can see nothing but green and the occasional splash of scarlet
berry in every direction.

A Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  As you make your way through the maze, the
sounds of its denizens become a little noisier.  It seems that the farther
you go, the more strange and exotic beings you find.  Here, a few branches
of the poisonous shrubbery are bent, as if a very strong creature was
determined at some point to break free.  The tough greenery held, though,
probably resulting in little more than sore muscles for the hapless
prisoner.  From here, you can make your way south or west in your efforts to
escape.

way through the thorny corridors, for the grass has grown completely out of
control, as if the Queen's magic were weaker here.  It's long enough to
reach knee-high on a centaur, and one can detect paths that have been
trampled down by creatures passing through it, though they seem kind of
narrow.  Despite the fact that no little glowing glass ball floats here,
there's an unmistakable brightness in this length of the maze.

blade into the ones around it.  It's so comfortable that it is something to
keep in mind for when (if) you ever get back to civilization.  You could
probably make quite a bit of gold stuffing it into shoes for those who spend
all day on their feet.  It does put quite a bit of spring into your step.

have to get out before you can make a profit.

underfoot is sticky with a clear slime that clings to you whenever you touch
it.  It glistens in the light of of a buzzing, glowing glass ball, no doubt
put here to allow the Queen a better look at her entertainment.  Somehow the
berries in this part of the labyrinth don't seem quite as appetizing. 
Poison is bad enough, but tacking on dripping slime is just gross.  If you
head north or south, you can probably get out of this stretch of corridor

An Intersection in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron, and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From
here, you can head north or west in your effort to escape.

A Sad Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Filtering through the darkness of the maze is a
low, snuffling sound.  Eventually it becomes recognizable as forlorn,
helpless weeping.  One can certainly imagine this place getting to some of
its residents enough to produce tears.  You won't break down though, right? 
You're a big tough adventurer, after all.  So, big tough adventurer, which
way are you going to go now, east or west?

  The labyrinth continues.  No sunlight or moonlight penetrates the curved,
thorny ceiling high above, leaving the passageways of the maze in darkness
similar to that of the day's dying rays.  It's not easy to see here without
straining one's eyes.  Those bright scarlet deathberries shine though, their
venomous fruit glowing with an inner, magic light.  They look mighty
tempting, attested to by the various bird carcasses laying near the hedge
walls.  Needless to say, the odor in the air here is nauseating.  Want to
get away from it?  Head north, east, or west.

the deathberries are coated with a fine misting of frost.  The temperature

  The labyrinth continues, believe it or not, despite the fact that in the
darkness, it's impossible to say just how far it goes.  An odd odor like
soured milk wafts up from the magically clipped grass, making one's stomach
turn.  One can hear some definite and loud wailing, like that of a child
lost far from home.  Of course, it wouldn't be surprising to find such a
creature in the labyrinth of the cruel Queen Jula.  If one wishes to
investigate, there are available and barely perceptible paths to the north,

  The labyrinth continues.  The grass here is tacky and the odor of drying
blood immediately informs one of the reason for it.  Of course, the nasty
stuff cannot be seen too well in the dark, perpetual night in this part of
the maze.  Obviously, though, battles have taken place here and one would

easily pushed aside and the imprisoning hedges warped as they escaped the

A Sour Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues, believe it or not, despite the fact that in the
darkness, it's impossible to say just how far it goes.  An odd odor like
soured milk wafts up from the magically clipped grass, making one's stomach
turn.  One can hear some definite and loud wailing, like that of a child
lost far from home.  Of course, it wouldn't be surprising to find such a
creature in the labyrinth of the cruel Queen Jula.  If one wishes to
investigate, there are available and barely perceptible paths to the north,
east, and south.

easy to notice that this section of the maze looks, well, cleaner than the
rest.  The fine, soft grass, already seeming to be neatly clipped, has been
fastidiously combed until it all leans in the same direction.  The branches
of the deathberry hedges gleam brightly, polished to a high shine and one
can't find a more dirt-free berry than right here.  Somebody must have been
very, very bored.  No doubt you are not, however, and you can head north or
south in your efforts to escape this deadly labyrinth.

occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in

the...  Oak?  Weeping willow?  Maple?  It's rather hard to discern, until
one spots the pair of bright yellow eyes hidden amongst the leaves.  It does
not seem inclined to move along the corridors to the east and west.

  The labyrinth continues.  Thank the gods, the glowbug globes hover here,
providing some weak light to see by.  An odd chattering can be heard, very
quick voices babbling, but the sound is maddeningly low and words cannot be
discerned.  It is very high-pitched in tone and quickly becomes rather
grating.  One could almost become more anxious to escape the sound (assuming
it's not madness inflicted by the maze) than to escape the labyrinth itself.
To that end, paths are available to the north, east, and south.

  The labyrinth continues.  Here the imprisoning corridors of hedge are
plunged into a darkness similar to a moonless midnight.  There's just the
tiniest bit of light, enough to let one's eyes adjust to the dark and see
enough to prevent most stumbles.  The deathberries still shine brightly,
giving clues to the location of the surrounding green walls, a definite boon
in avoiding the needle-sharp thorns growing there.  To the south, more light
can be discerned, but to the north is only more inky blackness.

  The labyrinth continues.  The sounds of the maze's occupants fade into
the background here, and no path is worn on the fastidious grass below.  The
hedges are pristine, branches loaded with deathberries both ripe and newly
budding.  The aroma of freshly attended grass is inhaled with each breath,
carrying a touch of honeysuckle.  It'd be perfect (assuming you weren't
imprisoned here against your will), except for the darkening all around you.
It's starting to get difficult to see very far.  In fact, the passage to the
south looks rather lighter, while the northern corridor gloams with thick
darkness.  The passageway to the east is simply an inky black hole in the
hedge.

mushroom here to feed a hundred people.  Then again, considering the way the

homemade tents have been constructed from the skins of various creatures
and racks of drying meat are placed strategically so a breeze won't carry

little bit wider than the norm and faint trails have been worn through the
short grass, though the dirt beneath isn't quite revealed.  It appears to be

deathberry bushes forming a dense, rounded corridor.  Here and there
bloodthirsty thorns stick out from the hedge, draining liquid nourishment
from those unwary enough to touch the sharp points.  It looks as if some of

A Harvested Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Green, green, and more green, it's not easy
being green.  This section is no exception to the general rule, with
deathberry bushes forming a dense, rounded corridor.  Here and there
bloodthirsty thorns stick out from the hedge, draining liquid nourishment
from those unwary enough to touch the sharp points.  It looks as if some of
the berries have been harvested here, no doubt for some evil purpose.  From
here you can go north, east, or west.

Help Keywords : Haste.
Help Category : Enhancement.

Last Updated  : 2017-08-28 18:47:53.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>
        haste   (Quickling only.)
        slow    (Quickling only.)

Spell Number: 53

Due to their freakish nature, quicklings can move at extreme speed.  This
speed equates to an extra attack during each round of combat.

Certain spellcasting classes have learned to mimic this ability with the
'haste' spell.  The spell also offers an improvement to their dexterity.
On top of the bonus attack given to anyone affected by haste, single-class
spellcasters gain another extra attack each round from the spell.

Quicklings may slow themselves down by typing 'slow', and resume their
heightened speed by typing 'haste'.  Regeneration rates are not influenced
by this condition.

Primary stat: Intelligence.
Affected by : Luck.

Instinct Bonus: The potential to increase total number of hits.

  The labyrinth comes to a dead end again.  The hedges gradually close,
though that might be due to the wild growth of greenery here.  The grass is
high and tangled and the shrubberies surge from their carved shape into a
nest of thorns and twigs through which it is impossible to see.  Yet, this
little section of the maze is rather comfortable, providing a place to rest
and relax without worrying about what might be sneaking up behind your back.
There is an oddity here, though - gnawed equine bones are strewn through the
grass.  Mmm, you don't happen to be a centaur, do you?

  The labyrinth continues.  This stretch of the thorny corridor is a
little bit wider than the norm and faint trails have been worn through the
short grass, though the dirt beneath isn't quite revealed.  It appears to be
a major thoroughfare for the denizens of the maze.  Dark yellow goo puddles
here and there, but while it doesn't look particularly appetizing, at least
there is little odor emanating from it.  The small pond, however, is crystal
clear and clean, offering a refreshing drink.  Here you have a choice of

it's hard to tell if they are simply more deathberries, or crimson eyes
watching you, planning vile acts against your person.  Maybe you ought to

A Fruitful Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  In the dim corridor of the maze, the
deathberries seem to be very prevalent here.  The luscious, scarlet fruit
hangs heavy on the branches of the hedge, almost begging to be picked and
eaten.  Of course, that wouldn't be the brightest of things to do, unless
you're in the mood for a slow, agonizing death.  Of course, you might suffer
that anyhow, if you don't escape from the labyrinth soon.  To that effort,
you can head north or east.

>>  A Harvested Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Green, green, and more green, it's not easy
being green.  This section is no exception to the general rule, with
deathberry bushes forming a dense, rounded corridor.  Here and there
bloodthirsty thorns stick out from the hedge, draining liquid nourishment
from those unwary enough to touch the sharp points.  It looks as if some of
the berries have been harvested here, no doubt for some evil purpose.  From
here you can go north, east, or west.

At a Pond in the Labyrinth (G)
  The labyrinth continues.  This stretch of the thorny corridor is a
little bit wider than the norm and faint trails have been worn through the
short grass, though the dirt beneath isn't quite revealed.  It appears to be
a major thoroughfare for the denizens of the maze.  Dark yellow goo puddles
here and there, but while it doesn't look particularly appetizing, at least
there is little odor emanating from it.  The small pond, however, is crystal
clear and clean, offering a refreshing drink.  Here you have a choice of
three pathways - one to the north, one east, and one southward.

small brown rodents can be seen zipping around the foliage.  It's not easy
getting through the thick greenery, but the fact that you feel refreshed

A Camp in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  In the shadowy corridors, you stumble into a
makeshift camp.  In a pit carefully cleared of grass, a small bonfire burns
with an inappropriate merriness.  Despite the sheltering earthen walls, the
flames twist the shadows into strange, leaping shapes.  A quartet of
homemade tents have been constructed from the skins of various creatures
and racks of drying meat are placed strategically so a breeze won't carry
the smell.  All in all it seems a well-organized little camp, albeit of
crude construction.  But that's not surprising, considering the
surroundings.  When you are ready to leave, the corridor continues to the
east and west.

some unknown language.  The sound penetrates to your bones, but it is a
pleasant sensation, relaxing and soothing.  You catch a glimpse of brilliant
green against the fading backdrop of the hedges and the song dies briefly,
only to resume a moment later.  It seems that perhaps this would be a decent

  The deathberry hedges of Dharivian are famed throughout the world.  Not
only do they bear heavy clusters of fruit in the form of luscious, poisonous
berries, but they can easily be shaped into all sorts of forms.  In this
case, the magic of Queen Jula has forced the shrubbery into long, enclosed
corridors.  The branches lace together overhead, forming a roof a hundred
feet high, and the passages are wide enough that several giants could walk
abreast.  You can see nothing but green and the occasional splash of scarlet
berry in every direction.

A Dome in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  This is, in fact, the largest part of the maze.
Instead of a long corridor, though, the hedges form a sqarish, domed chamber
easily twice the width of any other passageway in the labyrinth.  The soft
grass has been trampled flat, testament to the high number of creatures that
pass through here every day.  Or is it night?  In any case, four large
archways, to the north, east, south and west, lead further into the maze.

it might be realized that the carved shrubbery has been cleared of its spiky
thorns.  Instead of pricking a finger, one can detect...  Ribbons?  Yes,
after close examination, that's what they are - brightly colored ribbons,
interwoven into the mesh-like branches of the deathberry bushes.  It seems
somebody has been doing some redecorating.  There are two paths one can
follow from here: one to the east, and one to the south.

An Impossibly Dark Intersection in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Making one's way through the inky blackness,
one starts to become accustomed to the darkness.  One's hearing seems to
become more sensitive, every tiny stirring in the maze is startlingly loud. 
The advantage to the lack of light is that it makes you difficult to find

you hope so.  Groping fingers discover there are passageways leading north,

very green.  We are talking about the ultimate green of all time.  In this
stretch of the maze, even the deathberries are green, though they seem large
and ripe.  The color probably wouldn't be so overwhelming if there were some
variation in shade, but alas, the darkness has turned everything a dark
green matching the color of pine needles.  Yuck.  Three paths are available

A Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From
here, you can head east or west in your effort to escape.

have been oddly twisted here, although they remain unbroken and

undulating rather than sharply straight.  Granted, it makes for a much
smoother appearance to the walls of shrubbery, but it doesn't change the
fact that they still form a prison.  One can head east to get back into the

At the Town Gates of Dharivian
  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

On the Streets of Dharivian (G)
  The deeper you penetrate this large town, the more you get the feeling
that something is terribly wrong here.  Even in the thickest crowds, not a
single pickpocket has made an attempt at your gold, and you haven't even
seen any beggars.  The towers of the royal palace loom larger as you draw
near to it, casting shadows so deep that odd glass balls filled with glowing
insects have been set on poles to provide illumination.  It's when you reach
the gates of the palace itself that you spot a sign that might explain the
paranoid behavior of the populace.

The Entrance(?) to the Labyrinth
  The deathberry hedges of Dharivian are famed throughout the world.  Not
only do they bear heavy clusters of fruit in the form of luscious, poisonous
berries, but they can easily be shaped into all sorts of forms.  In this
case, the magic of Queen Jula has forced the shrubbery into long, enclosed
corridors.  The branches lace together overhead, forming a roof a hundred
feet high, and the passages are wide enough that several giants could walk
abreast.  You can see nothing but green and the occasional splash of scarlet
berry in every direction.

A Dead *cackle* End in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron, and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through, and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From
here, you can head north in your effort to escape.

determined at some point to break free.  The tough greenery held, though,
probably resulting in little more than sore muscles for the hapless

control, as if the Queen's magic were weaker here.  It's long enough to
reach knee-high on a centaur, and one can detect paths that have been
trampled down by creatures passing through it, though they seem kind of
narrow.  Despite the fact that no little glowing glass ball floats here,
there's an unmistakable brightness in this length of the maze.

blade into the ones around it.  It's so comfortable that it is something to
keep in mind for when (if) you ever get back to civilization.  You could
probably make quite a bit of gold stuffing it into shoes for those who spend
all day on their feet.  It does put quite a bit of spring into your step.

it.  It glistens in the light of of a buzzing, glowing glass ball, no doubt
put here to allow the Queen a better look at her entertainment.  Somehow the
berries in this part of the labyrinth don't seem quite as appetizing. 
Poison is bad enough, but tacking on dripping slime is just gross.  If you

At the Town Gates of Dharivian
  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

  The deeper you penetrate this large town, the more you get the feeling
that something is terribly wrong here.  Even in the thickest crowds, not a
single pickpocket has made an attempt at your gold, and you haven't even
seen any beggars.  The towers of the royal palace loom larger as you draw
near to it, casting shadows so deep that odd glass balls filled with glowing
insects have been set on poles to provide illumination.  It's when you reach
the gates of the palace itself that you spot a sign that might explain the
paranoid behavior of the populace.

>>  The Palace of Queen Jula (G)
  The Dharivian palace is truly a marvel to behold.  No doubt, the
tyrannies of Queen Jula must have included severe taxes to pay for the
furnishings here.  The walls are plated in pure gold, with trimmings of
glistening silver, and precious jewels were used to form murals on the
walls.  These pictures, of course, portray the Queen at her most beauteous,
as a conquering hero and gracious ruler.  You find the Queen herself holding
court in the main hall, mounted on a throne carved from emerald, high above
everybody else on her dais.  Oh, well.  Better luck next life.

The Entrance(?) to the Labyrinth
  The deathberry hedges of Dharivian are famed throughout the world.  Not
only do they bear heavy clusters of fruit in the form of luscious, poisonous
berries, but they can easily be shaped into all sorts of forms.  In this
case, the magic of Queen Jula has forced the shrubbery into long, enclosed
corridors.  The branches lace together overhead, forming a roof a hundred
feet high, and the passages are wide enough that several giants could walk
abreast.  You can see nothing but green and the occasional splash of scarlet
berry in every direction.

the hides of other creatures.  The effect is spoiled somewhat by the pile of

  The labyrinth continues.  As you make your way through the maze, the
sounds of its denizens become a little noisier.  It seems that the farther
you go, the more strange and exotic beings you find.  Here, a few branches
of the poisonous shrubbery are bent, as if a very strong creature was
determined at some point to break free.  The tough greenery held, though,
probably resulting in little more than sore muscles for the hapless
prisoner.  From here, you can make your way south or west in your efforts to
escape.

control, as if the Queen's magic were weaker here.  It's long enough to
reach knee-high on a centaur, and one can detect paths that have been
trampled down by creatures passing through it, though they seem kind of
narrow.  Despite the fact that no little glowing glass ball floats here,
there's an unmistakable brightness in this length of the maze.

An Intersection in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  No matter how far you go, everything looks the
same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are harder than iron, and
impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough wood is tight enough
that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze through and an
occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be several feet in
thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining ceiling, long sharp
thorns discourage climbing.  The fine, soft grass underfoot seems to be
neatly clipped, but that could just be an effect of the Queen's magic.  From
here, you can head north or west in your effort to escape.

A Sticky Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Eeewww.  The shrubbery and the short grass
underfoot is sticky with a clear slime that clings to you whenever you touch
it.  It glistens in the light of of a buzzing, glowing glass ball, no doubt
put here to allow the Queen a better look at her entertainment.  Somehow the

A Comfy Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  Here, the soft grass takes on a thicker, spongy
quality, as if something large and heavy passed over it, compressing each
blade into the ones around it.  It's so comfortable that it is something to
keep in mind for when (if) you ever get back to civilization.  You could
probably make quite a bit of gold stuffing it into shoes for those who spend
all day on their feet.  It does put quite a bit of spring into your step.

  The deathberry hedges of Dharivian are famed throughout the world.  Not
only do they bear heavy clusters of fruit in the form of luscious, poisonous
berries, but they can easily be shaped into all sorts of forms.  In this
case, the magic of Queen Jula has forced the shrubbery into long, enclosed
corridors.  The branches lace together overhead, forming a roof a hundred
feet high, and the passages are wide enough that several giants could walk
abreast.  You can see nothing but green and the occasional splash of scarlet
berry in every direction.

centaurs has taken up residence, the adults trying not to let the foals know
they are all prisoners.  For the most part, they succeed, but explaining the

undulating rather than sharply straight.  Granted, it makes for a much
smoother appearance to the walls of shrubbery, but it doesn't change the
fact that they still form a prison.  One can head east to get back into the

a frantic prisoner.  The branches, though, being as hard as iron, or harder,
resisted all but a few shallow cuts.  The powerful blows that must have been
inflicted on the shrubbery limbs may be, in one way, reassuring, or at least
informative.  If something that had the ability to even scratch the
poisonous plant could not make a dent, perhaps it's not so bad that you
cannot do it even that much.  In any case, one might head south, if he or

detect.  In fact, some might even find it delicious.  There is enough
mushroom here to feed a hundred people.  Then again, considering the way the

one is safe enough feeling carefully along the way.  Well, not counting all

be heard moving through the maze, sneaking up on hapless adventurers,
ripping flesh from bone...  Okay, that could just be something you /think/
you hear, rather than reality.  Do you really want to take that chance

a little pool here.  A raspy chuckle lets them know they are being observed,
which is a pretty good reason to hightail it west, back into the rest of the

  The labyrinth continues.  As you make your way through the maze, the
sounds of its denizens become a little noisier.  It seems that the farther
you go, the more strange and exotic beings you find.  Here, a few branches
of the poisonous shrubbery are bent, as if a very strong creature was
determined at some point to break free.  The tough greenery held, though,
probably resulting in little more than sore muscles for the hapless
prisoner.  From here, you can make your way south or west in your efforts to
escape.

Yep, this is the center of the maze. It's here that the Queen's magic is
strongest. The ground is bare rock without even a dusting of soil to
cushion footsteps, and every inch of the hedge walls are crowded with spiky
thorns. It's painfully bright here, enough to make one shade one's eyes,
though the source of the light is a mystery. In the very center of this
denuded patch of stone, a tall stake has been thrust deep into the ground.
Around it grows a special breed of deathberry bush, in the form of climbing
ivy that's a lot tougher than it looks. It also grows around the victim
chained to the pole, inflicting just enough poison to torture the poor man.
