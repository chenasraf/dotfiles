Above an Open Grave
  You climb up the edge of the wall until you find the ledge and pull
yourself up. You're outside now, but it's still quite dark. There are two
yellow, crescent moons shining from above a house up ahead, gently lighting
up the ground around you. You turn around to realize that what you've
crawled out of is actually a grave. In fact, this entire area reeks of
decomposing waste.  You're in a graveyard!

| Roume is completely right. i've been not focusing on much in aardwolf in
| general for quite some time. I do log on daily and afk alot, popping in
| long enough to quest and maybe answer a questions for someone. I haven't
| really had alot of time to do anything for the clan, i've dropped out
| of alot of epics, i'd love to try the new SKD and Trans2 but
| just can't find enough time to stay here for an hour at a time.
| 
| I'm hoping to get more time in RL soon, but who knows when that will
| happen. My stepping down has been a long time coming and i'm glad
| Roume pointed that out. Thank you!

| Hello Boot, The contest is now over. I tallied up everyone's cps and
| gave them entries in a list where everyone was spread out. ie I didn't
| put anyone's name next to each other. It was all completely random as
| in I gave no Fs on who got what slot. Then I had Anssett roll for the
| who group for 1st place so EVERYONE had a shot at top prize. Once we
| had a winner I removed their name from the list and had Anssett roll
| for all the remaining entries for 2nd place. Then repeated the process
| for 3rd place. These are the results.
| 
| 3rd Place Winning 25mil gold, 1 Tp Token, 50 qps, 1 Triv Incomp Potion,
| and 1 Trivia Spellup is Loro.
| 
| 2nd Place Winning 25mil gold, 2 Tp Tokens, 50 qps, 1 Whoname Token,
| 1 Pretitle Token, 3 Triv Incomp Potion, 3 Trivia Spellups is Flynnt.
| 
| Flynnt has done the most cps during the contest and also wins the Bonus
| Prize of 3 Tp Tokens.
| 
| And the winner of the raffle getting...
| 50 mil gold, 3 Tp Tokens, 50 qps, 2 whoname tokens, 2 pretitle tokens,
| 1 manor discount token, 4 Triv Incomp Potion, 4 Trivia Spellups is..
| 
| Abraxos
| 
| 
| Can a Leader please do what needs to happen to give 50 qps to Abraxos, Flynnt,
| and Loro please.
| 
| Thank you to everyone who participated and I hope some of you learned how
| valuable campaigns are in this game. Winners pass me a tell when online.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Grand Antechamber of the Sahuagin Palace
  The gloomy, stone walls rise above into a high, expansive dome that
vanishes into an inky darkness.  The lichen clinging to the stone gives off
a faint, sickly glow.  Monumental statues, carved from black, volcanic rock
are displayed on either side of you.  Each portrays a distorted, grotesque
Sahuagin and sharks performing horrific acts of torture to sea elves,
tritons and mermen.  The pure sense of evil that emanates from this chamber
causes you to sweat even in these underwater conditions.  To your north are
heavily-guarded, colossal coral-inlaid doors.  Guessing by the size of the
Sahuagin standing guard on either side, you get the feeling that something
of great importance is on the other side of those doors.  The deep black
eyes of the very large guard standing directly in front of the door fall on
you, leaving you with a twisting, nauseous feeling in your gut.

Sahuagin Service Chamber
  This dismal, cramped cave houses the domestic staff of the palace. 
Workers scurry in and out, performing various duties for the king and his
nobles.  You glance around the meager cave and find only some food scraps
and seaweed mats.  Bloodstains in the corner and the walls are a reminder to
the laborers that the king is not a patient creature and will not tolerate
being displeased.  A spot next to the bloodstains seems to be a tunnel.

heavily-guarded, colossal coral-inlaid doors.  Guessing by the size of the
Sahuagin standing guard on either side, you get the feeling that something

Grand Antechamber of the Sahuagin Palace
  The gloomy, stone walls rise above into a high, expansive dome that
vanishes into an inky darkness.  The lichen clinging to the stone gives off
a faint, sickly glow.  Monumental statues, carved from black, volcanic rock
are displayed on either side of you.  Each portrays a distorted, grotesque
Sahuagin and sharks performing horrific acts of torture to sea elves,
tritons and mermen.  The pure sense of evil that emanates from this chamber
causes you to sweat even in these underwater conditions.  To your north are
heavily-guarded, colossal coral-inlaid doors.  Guessing by the size of the
Sahuagin standing guard on either side, you get the feeling that something
of great importance is on the other side of those doors.  The deep black
eyes of the very large guard standing directly in front of the door fall on
you, leaving you with a twisting, nauseous feeling in your gut.

being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Turbulent Sea
  There is an abrupt change in the placid ocean waters.  The skies have
blackened and it seems that there is dark, corrupt magic causing the waves
to crash and churn violently against you.  A helpless feeling overwhelms you
as you find yourself being pulled down into the inky depths below you.

sharks that you fought in the alcove.  It is not luxurious quarters that
this prince resides in.  The walls are more of the rough, cold dark stone
that makes up the rest of the stronghold.  They glow softly with a
bioluminescence that is emitted from small sea bacteria.  Behind him hangs a
skull of shark, with his large jaws open as if the long dead animal is
reaching to devour you.  On one side of the room is a carved, stone table. 
Some bloodied, barbaric daggers lay alongside a bowl that looks to be filled
with body parts of unfortunate prisoners.  A rack of tridents and spears
hangs on the wall on the one side of him.  You send a quick prayer to your
deity as you prepare to meet this foe who is now staring coldly at you.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

serving drinks to the guards. The whole east wall has been converted 
to shelves to hold all of the booze here. They must have lots of

brain and you think you should sit down and have a drink, or two
or twenty even.

  More cells, well this is a prison, of course there will be cells.  The
moaning of the prisoners sends chills down your back, as you realize that
you could save them, or leave there here to die in these little cells.  To
the south you can see an intersection of this hall and the south hall.  Cells
stretch to the east and west.  To the far north you can barely make out the

Cell
  This cell is probably the most crowded cell in the prison. About three or 
four prisoners are sleeping thoughout this small cell. The water bucket is 
empty, and looks like it has been for quite some time. Some small crumbs of 
food are present, and most of that the rats are eating. The straw is 
scattered though the room, probably to give all the prisoners some comfort 
from the hard cold stone floor.

  Walking south down the hall, you quickly realize that you see the cells and 
the prisoners in them who are begging you to release them from this hellish 
place. To the north is the northeast corner. To the east and west, cells and 
to the south more of the hallway.

Cell
  This is another one of the cells in the prison. The straw matress
and small water bucket are present. Some small cracks are in the
stone walls, which allow some water and sand to pass though into
the cell. You hear the moaning of the prisoner here, as the life
in this room slowly fades away. Maybe you can save this person.

Main Hallway
  This is the main hallway of the prison. From here you can see the ramp from 
where you entered this hellish place. To the east and west you see the cells 
where the most unlucky prisoners are located. You see two guards approach 
you, and you are glad you hid in the shadows and could not be seen by them.
To the south, more cells are present. Probably more prisoners there too.

  Quickly running inside to shield you from the harsh desert winds you realize 
that you are in the Desert Prison. The Famed prison of which if anyone 
escapes will die from the desert. On either side of you, you see two fresh 
water springs that help make the prison self- sufficient in the desert. The 
nicely carved stones decorate the hall. You see the ramp proceed down to the 
prison. This was built that way to help cool the prison.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

Rift to the Empire of Aiighialla
  You are wandering within the timeless, grey nothingness known as
rift-space.  You are just beginning to feel utterly lost when you notice a
speck of color in the distance.  It seems to be coming from another rift
similar to the one you came from.  Throwing away caution, you head towards
it, hoping it will lead you out of here.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  The husk of a building is all that remains here. A sign lies covered in dust 
beside one of the walls, and is the only identification that this once was a

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Syntax: cast 'elemental focus' [air|earth|fire|water]
Spell Number: 526

Budding Elementalists learn the ability to align themselves with one of the
elements quite early in their studies. While attuned to one of the elements,
all damage based on that element-- whether from spells or weapons-- will be
increased. It should be noted, however, that the elements are fickle, and a
mage may only be aligned to one at a time.

When casting the spell, if no element is chosen the last element invoked is
used.

Elemental Focus does not benefit from the duration wish.

Spell available only to the Elementalist Mage Subclass.

Primary Stat: Intelligence

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

After fireballs, the talented mage moves on to master the art of lightning.
Unlike the natural lightning used by rangers in the wilderness, the power
of a mage's lightning is drawn directly from their will.  High noble mages
have even been rumored to be able to generate as much as a bolt of
lightning from each finger of the hand used to cast the spell ...

A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

Smoke rises from the rubble through the gates and lingers, making the air 
throughout the caves heavy. Patrols of dark elves wander back and forth 
through the deserted city streets, ensuring they will not lose the city

  This is the section of the city where the trading market once stood. The dark

have been smashed or burnt beyond recognition. To the east is where the main 
fire still burns, and the heat of it is even evident from over here, although
the distance from it feels generously safe. It looks like the disaster here 
has already been picked through and anything of interest has been taken.
This is not surprising, considering the number of slaves that must have 
broken free during the battle that waged here. Any dead bodies have also been
carted off, and the rubble has been sort of pushed off to the side in places 
to create a narrow walking path.

Entrance to the Temple of the Night
  In order to reach the entrance to the most important building in the dark
elf city, the Temple of the Night, there is a path that heads up a cluster
of stalagmites that have grown together into a strange, gnarly pattern.
The path twists up, and up, and up, through the middle of a massive
cavern. How is it that these stalagmites grew to be so tall, and how lucky
were the dark elves to find a cavern so large? One very likely possibility
is that the dark elves used their magic to create this cavern and all that
is within it. Near the top of the mass of stalagmites, is the temple
entrance. At this point the stalagmites have somehow managed to wrap
themselves around the temple's set of double doors. It is tough to discern
exactly what is going on, because the doors are a glossy black, and the
stalagmites are also black. This setting is the stuff of nightmares. To
make things more confusing, will-o'-the-wisps dance across the scene every
so often, further impeding the ability to discern what is going on by
occluding vision with their bright flash of light. The path is made of
shiny, slippery, obsidian stones, and the temple door is flanked with
imposing statues depicting the handmaidens of the great goddess of the
dark elves. Their goddess is simply known as the Dark Lady, since invoking
her true name is said to bring with it her wrath. The handmaidens are
serpentine, with elven torsos and heads. They wear armor that has been
built from the skulls of the Dark Lady's enemies. The lower halves of
their bodies are like the bodies of snakes, and they also have dragon-like
wings on their backs. Their faces are drawn back in snarls, daring the
uninvited to open the temple door.

Inside the Temple of the Night
  This is no normal temple. Stepping into the Temple of the Night is like
entering into a different type of reality. It is dark as night, and a
sound like whispering seems to come from every direction. Sometimes the
whispers get so close to the ears that it seems as if whatever is making
the sound is hovering right beside them. The shadowy mist that began to
make itself known at the temple entrance is even thicker in here. When it
is so thick that it is difficult to see, a strong floral scent arises,
then the mist always seems to dissipate a bit, but the smell is
overwhelming enough to cause dizziness. The floors in the temple are black
marble, and echo a loud clacking noise with each step an individual takes,
since the temple hall is so massive. Whenever the black fog clears enough
to be able to look around, it is still difficult to see, since it is so
dark. There is a faint light emitting from a source high above, however.
Upon looking upwards to investigate, it is revealed that some sort of
enchantment has been added to the temple to make it appear as if there are
tiny points of light lurking up high in the temple's rafters, like stars.
The swirls of mist move away to reveal statues that depict
gruesome-looking creatures, and other expensive adornments to the temple,
then quickly hide them again, teasing the onlooker.

Entrance to the Temple of the Night
  In order to reach the entrance to the most important building in the dark
elf city, the Temple of the Night, there is a path that heads up a cluster
of stalagmites that have grown together into a strange, gnarly pattern.
The path twists up, and up, and up, through the middle of a massive
cavern. How is it that these stalagmites grew to be so tall, and how lucky
were the dark elves to find a cavern so large? One very likely possibility
is that the dark elves used their magic to create this cavern and all that
is within it. Near the top of the mass of stalagmites, is the temple
entrance. At this point the stalagmites have somehow managed to wrap

Northeastern Temple Road
  This is the section of the city where the trading market once stood. The dark
elves haven't done much yet, with respect to cleaning up the mess here, so 
the marketplace is still a complete disaster. Carts lie tipped-over, and many
have been smashed or burnt beyond recognition. To the east is where the main 
fire still burns, and the heat of it is even evident from over here, although
the distance from it feels generously safe. It looks like the disaster here 
has already been picked through and anything of interest has been taken.
This is not surprising, considering the number of slaves that must have 
broken free during the battle that waged here. Any dead bodies have also been
carted off, and the rubble has been sort of pushed off to the side in places 
to create a narrow walking path.

  The cave system that the dark elves chose to make their city in seems to be a
series of caverns containing what could almost be referred to as a forest of 
stalagmites. It is surreal, how large these stalagmites have grown. Each of 
these gigantic stalagmites has been made into a building that is tall enough 
to hold five to ten stories within its structure. This is evident because 
each story of each building contains a balcony for the dark elves to walk out
onto. Since dark elves are fond of using the power of levitation to get to 
where they need to be, these balconies aid them either in accessing the city 
streets or in returning them to the room they desire to occupy, in the least 
amount of time necessary.

dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Spell Number: 232

After fireballs, the talented mage moves on to master the art of lightning.
Unlike the natural lightning used by rangers in the wilderness, the power
of a mage's lightning is drawn directly from their will.  High noble mages
have even been rumored to be able to generate as much as a bolt of
lightning from each finger of the hand used to cast the spell ...

Crumbling Field
  This field is slowly crumbling into the rushing river to the east. As you 
watch, more and more of the unprotected shoreline ripples away into the 
thunderous water. To the northwest, a small forest broods over the fields all
around it. Somewhere eastwards, a small trail collapses into what has become 
known as Kettermoor Crick: the fishy river leading into what is known as 
Mesolar's melting pot of debauchery. One may merely cross the Kettermoor to 
enter Fellchantry.

On the Crickbridge Road
  It was a dark and stormy night...

  There's a saying out in the darker parts of the country that, for a man
in the right kinds of trouble, all roads lead to Fellchantry. They say that
when "No Fear" Narlfryd, the famed Wolfen daredevil, needed a place to lay
low, he came to Fellchantry and knifed a guy over a card game. The story
goes that he wanted to use a vacation in a cell as a chance to let a bad
storm blow over. The authorities didn't give him the chance. They took one
look at that body, shook their heads, and walked the other way. Fellchantry
is just that kind of place. Around here, they're ALL dark and stormy nights,
and the residents like it that way just fine.

  To the east lies the bridge over Kettermoor Crick, the deceptively named
fast-running river that supplies Fellchantry with its ne'erending supply of
fish, trade taxes, and surly attitudes.

The Bridge Over Kettermoor Crick
    The rushing waters of Kettermoor Crick flow far below this sturdy stone
bridge. In the miserable old days, the people that first settled this
godsforsaken scar of land built the bridge to access Fellchantry-- the squat,
sprawling island that sits astride the river like the biggest bully in the
schoolyard. Or so they say anyway... Really, it'd make just as much sense if
they built the bridge to give themselves something high enough to jump from.
Fellchantry isn't what you'd call a vacation spot. The water is colder
and darker than a witch's heart. The fog-- like a mourner's veil-- stretches
perpetually over the land, as if the sun just can't eat a big enough
breakfast to ever cook it off. This is where dreams go to die.

  To the west the Crickbridge Road leads away from town. To the east the city
of Fellchantry looms, looking like the saddest verse of the most dismal dirge
you've ever heard. If the word on the street is true, then the murdered smith
is somewhere inside, his body giving off the putrescent stench of a mystery.

Fellchantry Square
  Here, filled with all manner of sights and smells, is Fellchantry Square.
In the constant hell of the Barony, this is where the honest (and you have
to be flexible on your definition here) citizens come to gossip, barter, and
conduct their necessary business. The square is a microcosm of the city; all
cramped buildings, bustling crowds, and narrow side streets. A guy could get
lost with the slightest wandering from the beaten path, and he probably
wouldn't like where he ended up. The only thing less welcoming than
Fellchantry's main streets are its back alleys.
 
  The spikes of the raised Kettermoor gate loom to the west like a dragon
waiting for a snack. From all other directions the cramped chaos of the
square presses in.

dozens of replacements over the years (or perhaps decades). Up to the helm,

feature of His Majesty's Court of Justice. On it is a simple judge's bench,
its face decorated with the Baron's coat of arms. Those wondering about the
Baron's views on justice can find their questions answered by the large
painting that totally dominates the wall behind the bench. Simply titled,
"Justice," it depicts a woman with a radiant halo and pure white vestments
holding a sword aloft with one elegantly-sandled foot atop a pile of corpses.
It's not exactly the sort of court at whose mercy one throws oneself.
Non-descript hardwood benches are arranged in two aisles so that the
populace may observe the proceedings of the court, though few ever do.

  If you were to close one eye, tilt your head a bit, and then close your other
eye, you might be able to suss out some details past the first inches of the 
hardly-opaque waters which stream underfoot from the east towards a grate in 
the western wall, eventually plummeting away into darkness. No doubt it leads
to Kettermoor Crick; a wasteful supply, at that. It doesn't smell nearly as 
bad here as it does when one enters Fellchantry's spiked maw to the 
southwest. Alas, silence itself is also quite the rare commodity among the 
ramshackle stone buildings which make up the settlement; one would not need 
to strain their ears to hear the rattling of bars and enraged yells beyond

Fellchantry Square
  Here, traffic is heavy. Oft there would be two seperate rows leading to and 
fro the double doors which rest upon rusted hinges to the east, possibly 
never having been closed over decades of being pelted with rain and snow 
until lodged in place permanently. Commotion never ceases amidst merriment 
and the frequent clatter of a good old fashioned brawl among the 
establishment's patrons.
 
To the south and the west Fellchantry Square continues to sprawl out, cobbles
underfoot sodden and trampled deep beneath the earth after years of harried 
abuse.

Fellchantry Square
  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the 
closer one moves towards the hulking drawbridge which lies eastwards and is 
stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.
 
To the north, south and west, the Square continues to sprawl out and avail 
itself of the free (yet more dangerous) space offered here.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

Fellchantry Square
  Here, filled with all manner of sights and smells, is Fellchantry Square.
In the constant hell of the Barony, this is where the honest (and you have
to be flexible on your definition here) citizens come to gossip, barter, and
conduct their necessary business. The square is a microcosm of the city; all
cramped buildings, bustling crowds, and narrow side streets. A guy could get
lost with the slightest wandering from the beaten path, and he probably
wouldn't like where he ended up. The only thing less welcoming than
Fellchantry's main streets are its back alleys.
 
  The spikes of the raised Kettermoor gate loom to the west like a dragon
waiting for a snack. From all other directions the cramped chaos of the
square presses in.

Fellchantry Square
  The southwestern portion of Fellchantry Square is most notable for being
the location of the city's shopping district, such as it is. Small
mercantile shops abound, each with signs boasting their wares. The largest
of the shops, the general store, boasts a sign reading: "Needful Things
For Sale or Trade." From the flow of traffic in and out of the shop, its
Things must be very Needful indeed.

  To the south marvelous things are for sale. To the north and east
the square offers other amusements.

city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,

  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

  A welcome break from the square, buildings of stone and layered over with 
plaster cascade in varying shapes and forms towards the south. Beddings and 
pots provide a surprisingly lush fauna in reflection to the denizens which 
march these cobblestone ways - lords and ladies by any given right, all 
marred with some deformation or another which tells of their past during (or 
perhaps prior to) their stay within Fellchantry. Surely the Barony had seen 
no opulence like this since Valkur himself had fallen.
 
To one's north they would find their gaze fixated upon the many bodies which 
traffic Fellchantry Square, while southwards the opulence continues. Many

  A conglomerate of buildings continue to sprawl their way southwards and 
eventually come to an end at an awakward cul de sac, though the brilliant 
white of cobble beneath an eternal gloomy sky have yet to lose their luster 
within the Barony. Yonder west lies perhaps the most inconspicuous building 
of the lot - enough so that one may not place words to it lest they venture 
beyond their vocabulary. Eastwards, however, among the cries of "Ho, lad!" 
for carriageboys rests a grand manor upon evidently rich soil, its gardens 
immaculate and lacking no maintenance. 
 
Northwards La Rochelle Row continues before eventually terminating within
the infamous Fellchantry Square, where a particular entanglement of scents
may remind the denizens of this lovely place of "home".

Fellchantry Square
  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

  A welcome break from the square, buildings of stone and layered over with 
plaster cascade in varying shapes and forms towards the south. Beddings and 
pots provide a surprisingly lush fauna in reflection to the denizens which 
march these cobblestone ways - lords and ladies by any given right, all 
marred with some deformation or another which tells of their past during (or 
perhaps prior to) their stay within Fellchantry. Surely the Barony had seen 
no opulence like this since Valkur himself had fallen.
 
To one's north they would find their gaze fixated upon the many bodies which 
traffic Fellchantry Square, while southwards the opulence continues. Many 
structures present the grace and presence of emulated royalty, though some 
find themselves distinguished from others via eye-catching entrances and bold
gatherings before their respective halls.

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.

The Guild
  The working class of Fellchantry: the Guild is a simple stone building which 
one may mistake for a tavern or bar at a glance. Tables and chairs are 
littered across the area in no particular pattern. At the far western edge of
the room is a long, wide bar, the wall behind it lined with wooden shelves 
housing a large selection of liquors with no label or indication of what it 
may be, though whatever barkeep may be servicing the organization's members 
seems to know exactly what lies where, what goes into what, and which 
concoction to conjure. Upon the northern and southern walls are a scattering 
of mis-matched decor. Right next to a large tapestry is a taxidermied boar's 
head, or an emblem with crossed swords embossed upon a wooden panel would 
hang askew, teetering on the edge of harpooning the skull of whoever may find 
themselves beneath it should it eventually decide to fall.

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.

their heart's most cherished treasure is bound to be on the next shelf they

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and

jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and

on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the

stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.

Bridge Three
  A tale as old as time, the denizens of Fellchantry have wondered for many 
decades - perhaps centuries - why the very structure which bridges 
Fellchantry Square and the dwelling of His Lordship, Lord Whatshisface, had 
never gotten an official name. Lo, the name of this bridge is carved into the
timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like
tree stumps and their stances that of great sentries who guard the good 
Lord's halls. Lo, they nor their impassive watch comes to a halt.
  
Lo, how snugly their britches fit.

    Lauded as the place to be in Fellchantry, the ironically named "Baron's 
Beerhouse" (most likely never visited by the Baron himself, if rumor is to be
believed) houses a massive selection of tables, chairs, sounds, smells and 
people. The walls are adorned with basic decor and sconces which have long 
since been coated by wax from dripping candles, then coated again and never
cleaned. Smoke hangs in the air as thick as the noise generated by the 
milling of bodies and full-bellied laughter.

  A quieter corner of the beerhouse, though merely in comparison as opposed to 
fact or widely accepted truth, laughter can be heard rolling through the area
from all directions. More broody folk appear to make themselves at home here,
corner tables and chairs allowing a decent view of the area, though spaced 
apart enough for some to enjoy their drinks in relative solitude. The wall 
sconces here are caked to the brim with old wax, the idea of replenishing the
candles in this spot a long forgotten memory.

across the northern and eastern wall, eventually terminating in a small door 
which swings this way and that as bartenders move their way in and out to 
serve the establishment's patrons. Many of the more relaxed, or perhaps 
careless, folk sit here with their backs to the door at the bar's edge, 
jokingly referred to as the "maintenance team" for keeping the taps flowing 
and the kegs empty as payment. Laughter rolls through the air of the 
beerhouse, almost as if trapped in permanent festivity.

  Perhaps the busiest corner of the beerhouse, this area has a seating 
arrangement in the form of booths which line the eastern and southern edges 
of the area. A preferred space, no doubt, as these seats appear to be 
permanently occupied by those who would use line of sight to the western 
doors to their advantage. Some call it anxiety, yet others may suggest that 
it is mere precaution given the nature of work conducted in the Barony.

The Bridge Over Kettermoor Crick (1863)

On the Crickbridge Road
  It was a dark and stormy night...

  There's a saying out in the darker parts of the country that, for a man
in the right kinds of trouble, all roads lead to Fellchantry. They say that
when "No Fear" Narlfryd, the famed Wolfen daredevil, needed a place to lay
low, he came to Fellchantry and knifed a guy over a card game. The story
goes that he wanted to use a vacation in a cell as a chance to let a bad
storm blow over. The authorities didn't give him the chance. They took one
look at that body, shook their heads, and walked the other way. Fellchantry
is just that kind of place. Around here, they're ALL dark and stormy nights,
and the residents like it that way just fine.

  To the east lies the bridge over Kettermoor Crick, the deceptively named
fast-running river that supplies Fellchantry with its ne'erending supply of
fish, trade taxes, and surly attitudes.

The Bridge Over Kettermoor Crick
    The rushing waters of Kettermoor Crick flow far below this sturdy stone
bridge. In the miserable old days, the people that first settled this
godsforsaken scar of land built the bridge to access Fellchantry-- the squat,
sprawling island that sits astride the river like the biggest bully in the
schoolyard. Or so they say anyway... Really, it'd make just as much sense if
they built the bridge to give themselves something high enough to jump from.
Fellchantry isn't what you'd call a vacation spot. The water is colder
and darker than a witch's heart. The fog-- like a mourner's veil-- stretches
perpetually over the land, as if the sun just can't eat a big enough
breakfast to ever cook it off. This is where dreams go to die.

  To the west the Crickbridge Road leads away from town. To the east the city
of Fellchantry looms, looking like the saddest verse of the most dismal dirge
you've ever heard. If the word on the street is true, then the murdered smith
is somewhere inside, his body giving off the putrescent stench of a mystery.

Fellchantry Square
  Here, filled with all manner of sights and smells, is Fellchantry Square.
In the constant hell of the Barony, this is where the honest (and you have
to be flexible on your definition here) citizens come to gossip, barter, and
conduct their necessary business. The square is a microcosm of the city; all
cramped buildings, bustling crowds, and narrow side streets. A guy could get
lost with the slightest wandering from the beaten path, and he probably
wouldn't like where he ended up. The only thing less welcoming than
Fellchantry's main streets are its back alleys.
 
  The spikes of the raised Kettermoor gate loom to the west like a dragon
waiting for a snack. From all other directions the cramped chaos of the

Fellchantry Square
  The southwestern portion of Fellchantry Square is most notable for being
the location of the city's shopping district, such as it is. Small
mercantile shops abound, each with signs boasting their wares. The largest
of the shops, the general store, boasts a sign reading: "Needful Things
For Sale or Trade." From the flow of traffic in and out of the shop, its
Things must be very Needful indeed.

  To the south marvelous things are for sale. To the north and east
the square offers other amusements.

Fellchantry Square
  The presence of the barony's courthouse to the north does nothing to curb
the traffic of the usual ne'er-do-wells and cutthroats here. For the majority
of the Justiciars-- Fellchantry's city guards-- the pay just isn't good
enough to really make an effort. The occasional drunk gets roughed up, and
a murderer may even be arrested if he's a little too indiscrete, but in the
end it's just keeping up appearances. Who cares about a murder when no one
misses the deceased? Besides, everyone in Fellchantry is guilty of something.

  Justice waits to the north, longing for someone to avenge the slander done
to her name. The square looms predatorily to the east and south.

Last Updated  : 2017-08-20 16:50:12.

Syntax: cast 'lightning strike' <victim>
Damage: electric
Spell Number: 232

After fireballs, the talented mage moves on to master the art of lightning.
Unlike the natural lightning used by rangers in the wilderness, the power
of a mage's lightning is drawn directly from their will.  High noble mages
have even been rumored to be able to generate as much as a bolt of
lightning from each finger of the hand used to cast the spell ...

Last Updated  : 2018-01-15 00:48:07.

Syntax: cast 'elemental focus' [air|earth|fire|water]
Spell Number: 526

Budding Elementalists learn the ability to align themselves with one of the
elements quite early in their studies. While attuned to one of the elements,
all damage based on that element-- whether from spells or weapons-- will be
increased. It should be noted, however, that the elements are fickle, and a
mage may only be aligned to one at a time.

When casting the spell, if no element is chosen the last element invoked is
used.

Elemental Focus does not benefit from the duration wish.

Spell available only to the Elementalist Mage Subclass.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

Crudely Carved Passage
  It is pitch black, and you wait a moment for your eyes to adjust so you
can get your bearings.  You soon realize that you are in the middle of some
sort of Sahuagin stronghold.  The passage you stand in leads off in various
directions.  The faint shrieks of pain and death coming from beyond the stone
walls send tremors of apprehension through your body.

Lair of Prince Tumek
  You have come face to face with the formidable figure of one of the
Sahuagin princes.  He is surrounded by several guards and more of the same
sharks that you fought in the alcove.  It is not luxurious quarters that
this prince resides in.  The walls are more of the rough, cold dark stone
that makes up the rest of the stronghold.  They glow softly with a
bioluminescence that is emitted from small sea bacteria.  Behind him hangs a
skull of shark, with his large jaws open as if the long dead animal is
reaching to devour you.  On one side of the room is a carved, stone table. 
Some bloodied, barbaric daggers lay alongside a bowl that looks to be filled
with body parts of unfortunate prisoners.  A rack of tridents and spears
hangs on the wall on the one side of him.  You send a quick prayer to your
deity as you prepare to meet this foe who is now staring coldly at you.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Approaching the Camp of the Gathering Horde
  Going down the hill, you can see the expansive plains of Hathzor spread out 
limitless before you, only broken by the harsh mountains to the north and the
Great Desert to the south-east. Sarcoph's warcamp dominates your view, a 
smoking black sore, a loud and bustling abomination choking the land's 
beauty. Trees logged from the local mountains have been shaved to form a gory
fence circling the encampment, ogre heads impaled intermittently on the 
saplings.

  You have finally reached the end of the camp, but instead of relief for the 
end of an unbearably long walk, all you can feel is awe. Awe, because to the 
east lies a tent that is impossibly large. No amount of physical coordination
could equal that required to construct it. From within come the sounds of 
explosions and shouts, and you wonder what is inside.

  If the resonating din outside the tent didn't prepare you for the sheer chaos
inside, that's not surprising. Smoke and steam cloud the air, piercing 
whistles shred your mind with their wails, unidentifiable objects fly through
the air, and fires erupt from the strangest places. The magnitude of this 
tent is absurd, and though you don't know who could have set it up, you know 
you don't want to be under it if it falls.

that is altogether confusing. Pipes stick up at odd angles from the ground 
with fluids of unknown origins bubbling out the ends and forming puddles on 
the cleared floor. In the middle of the room is a good sized bathtub, filled 
to brim with ... That is wrong.

     A bathtub filled with excrement chokes you with its stench.
(Hidden) (Red Aura) Out of the filth erupts a gurgling mess of toxicity that slides closer and

The Supervisor's Office [**> PK <**]
  This is the office of the poor soul assigned to overseeing the gnomes' 
progress. A poorly constructed desk sits charred and abandoned against the 
wall of the tent, looking forlorn and well beyond its prime. An uncomfortable
looking chair, overturned in the middle of the room, looks a fitting partner 
for the abused desk. You decide to search for the luckless chap in charge.

Entrance to the Gnomish Siege Factory (G)
  If the resonating din outside the tent didn't prepare you for the sheer chaos
inside, that's not surprising. Smoke and steam cloud the air, piercing 
whistles shred your mind with their wails, unidentifiable objects fly through
the air, and fires erupt from the strangest places. The magnitude of this 
tent is absurd, and though you don't know who could have set it up, you know 
you don't want to be under it if it falls.

[ Exits: north east south (west) ]
(Red Aura) The bolt launched from a half-finished ballista falls laughably short of your person.

At a Tent Unparalleled in Size (G)
  You have finally reached the end of the camp, but instead of relief for the 
end of an unbearably long walk, all you can feel is awe. Awe, because to the 
east lies a tent that is impossibly large. No amount of physical coordination
could equal that required to construct it. From within come the sounds of 
explosions and shouts, and you wonder what is inside.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An

        mafiainfo                     : Global mafia chat channel.

Mafia is a game which pits an uninformed majority (the citizens/innocents) 
against an informed minority (the mafia). In Aardwolf, Mafia games can be 
hosted by a player for other players. 

Mafia Helps & Information

For game options, see 'help mafia-options'.

For game commands, see 'help mafia-commands'.

For a list of roles, see 'help mafia-roles'.

For tips, strategies, and rules, see 'help mafia-tips'.


Gameplay

The game begins with the Mafia phase, when the Mafia (and optionally the
Vigilante) perform their kill(s). After the Mafia have acted, the night
transitions to the police/doctor phase. When the police and doctor have
used their abilities, the morning comes and any deaths are announced.
There is some time for discussion, and then all players may nominate each 
other for lynching. Each player seconded may defend himself, and then all 
players vote on each lynch candidate. A majority is required to kill; note 
that this refers to the majority of players in the game, not the majority 
of players who voted.

The game ends when one side eliminates (or nearly eliminates) the other(s).


If you have any questions, please feel free to post a note to Imm on the 
Personal board -- hope you enjoy Mafia!

Rangers have special abilities to locate creatures within the realm in the

powerful that it will detect creatures covered under the veil of sneak and
invisibility.  It is not powerful enough, however, to find other player
characters.

Syntax: cast summon <character>
Spell Number: 77

This spell summons a player from anywhere else in the world into your
room. Characters who are fighting may not be summoned.  You also cannot 
summon while on a quest or campaign.

By default, you are not summonable.  You must type 'nosummon' to toggle the
ability to be summoned.  Once summoned, you will again be immune to summon,
until you type 'nosummon' yet again.  To disable this safety feature, type
'autonosummon'.

The spell only works on other players.  Mobs can not be summoned.

Syntax: cast 'chaos portal' <ingredient> (continent)     (See below.)
Spell Number: 334

In ancient times when the world was far less stable and the Demonlord
would often descend upon the cities of Aardwolf, an emergency escape plan
was developed. This involved the creation of portals that could be handed
out to the fleeing citizens of Aardwolf. Each portal would take its owner
to a completely random location. While many had considerable misfortune in
their destinations and were slain anyway, many others survived. The
spreading of victims across the realm made it impossible for the Demonlord
to slaughter everyone so at least some survived....

Casting this spell on a blank ingredient will activate the portal and set
a destination.  The type and destination of this portal vary depending
upon the ingredient; see 'help chaos portal types' for an explanation, as
well as information on the 'continent' argument available to Navigators.

Primary stat: Wisdom.
Affected by : Intelligence, Luck.

If an existing chaos portal goes nowhere (due to an area being removed),
see 'help portal replacements' for rules for replacing it.

Blank Chaos Portals can be purchased from Ravi for trivia points, may be
daily blessing reward, or may be purchased from other players.

Inside the Great Gates
  You have passed through the great polished bronze gates of Reme, into a
city that is as splendid as the legends say.  Great domes crown the
buildings of white marble, and silver mouldings show scenes from legends
along the tops of walls all over the city.  It indeed must be a blinding
sight during sunrise and sunset.  You can see roads running to your north
and south, and some sort of large marketplace seems to be to your east.

Entrance to the Bazaar (G)
  Smells overpower you, strange incenses that burn in oddly twisted pots,
exotic fruits from lands that no human has seen dried and hung from wooden
poles.  Voices speak in a thousand tongues, harsh northern speech conflicted
with soft eastern syllables in a cascade of noise that threatens your
composure and sanity.  The crowd that gawks in every booth and at every
wonder adds its own special noises and smells to this wonderful chaos, that
is the Bazaar at Reme.

  Your head is definitely hurting now from the noise of the massive crowd
around you.  Women, men and children barter at every tent and table for
every imaginable item in the chaos that is the great Reman Bazaar.  Stalls
line every inch of square, with brightly coloured tents taking up the space
along the edges.  Storekeepers wander by dressed in exotic silks and linens,
while nobles and commoners alike wander by in awe.  Welcome to the square of
the Bazaar.

ground, with carvings of palm leaves and olive branches decorating the

middle years with a regal bearing.  His cold stare tells that well the
sculptor his passions read, as he stares beyond the walls of Reme.  A small
plaque at the statue's feet reads simply 'Emperor Octavian.'  Roadways lead

exotic water plants, while magical songbirds dance and sing in streams of

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Astra Road (1838)

Astra Road
  You walk along the east/west running Astra road, admiring the various
guilds of Reme.  This section appears to house the guilds of Warriors and
Mages, at least this is what the signs seem to indicate.  To your north a
painted sword and shield hang from a wooden post, and to your south a
glowing symbol of an open hand floats mysteriously in mid air.  Astra road
continues to the west and east.

A Dank Sewer Tunnel (1885)

   Taarn looks up at you with a feverish look in his eyes.
 He tries to rise, but his broken leg gives out and he cries out in pain.
 Taarn says 'Please... you MUST help Felisluna... Rok has her and he has lost
 whatever sanity and morals he once possessed!  You MUST find her!'
 
 Taarn motions north with his hand.
 
 He says 'She is somewhere out there... in the sewers... his headquarters is hidden
 somewhere out there.  Please... you are her only chance now that my leg has fallen
 victim to his trap... Please go help her.'

The Grand Sewer (1881)

An ancient tunnel (G)
  This small tunnel, carved into the walls of the great sewer, seems to
have once housed quarters and storerooms for the maintenence staff that kept
the waters flowing smoothly out from the city's heart.  Rusted iron brackets
still hold long dimmed magic lanterns that still yet hold a faint spark of
light in this impossible gloom.  A rotted wooden door sits barely closed to
your south.

An abandoned storeroom
  This ancient storeroom is filled with rotting supplies and tools.  Water
drips from a cracked stone ceiling onto piles of rusty picks and shovels
piled loosely in one corner.  Scurrying noises tell you that small animals
have in time infested the rotted piles of rough woven cloth sacks laying
loosely in one corner, and one shelf to the south seems to be the only thing
intact.  Indeed the shelf looks like it is almost new, strange given the age
and neglect of this forgotten room.

A Roughly Carved Passage (1878)

Antechamber
  This hallway extends from north to south, and seems to have been carved
from the Reman stone very roughly, almost as if some magical beast tore its
way through the rock like a berserk mole.  A door is set into the west wall,
with a strange emblem seeming to be of a bloodstained mandolin?  The hallway
continues north and south.

Rok's Office (1876)

Rok's Workshop (G)
  This room is filled with insane instruments, measuring things that only
Rok understands.  In one corner of the cluttered bench he appears to be
trying to combine a chicken and a cow...  For what fiendish reason, you
cannot imagine.  In the other side of the workshop he has a small table with
cluttered writings...  All of which are crazed rambling sonnets and poems. 
You had best leave this place as soon as possible.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Alabaster Road
  This road is made completely of perfectly placed, white stone. Several 
evergreen trees grow alongside the south side of the road, shading you from 
the sun year round. A tall, white wall follows the road along the northern 
side. It appears too high to climb, and there are no holes in the wall to 
climb through. Perhaps a gate is nearby. The road continues to the east and

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

individual cushioned chairs are provided for visitors to rest after their
long journey to the Bonded Guild.  Books stand neatly on glass-topped

enough that three people can walk through it abreast, a torch sconce on the

The Lea
  The Lea is several acres of lush grassland, expanding over gently rolling
hills.  Several groves of fruit trees break up the horizon, and each breeze
leaves a delicious aroma lingering on the air.  The Guildmembers' involved
with pegasi live here with their partners, their green and brown tents
blending in to the surroundings.  A wide but deliciously clear and cold
stream burbles its way eastish, and a few tasteful bridges allow passage
over it.  To the south can be glimpsed a large wooden shelter provided for
truly inclement weather.

The Training Field (1901)

The Training Field
  The training field is huge, covering several acres.  This was, perhaps,
optimism on the part of the first Guild, who built the base.  The air
is filled with pegasi, dragons, and their human counterparts, perfecting the
skills they're going to need in the upcoming war.  The ground has long since
been packed hard from centuries of traffic by hooves and feet, and the only
grass that grows is at the very edges of the field.  A sheer cliff forms the
western and southern borders, though forest can be glimpsed to the
Southeast, and wooden buildings such as the one just south of here have been
built into tunnels in the semi-surrounding mountain.

A Long Hallway (1899)

A Long Hallway
  This is a rather cheerful hallway- the wooden walls are painted in sunny
yellow with purple doors.  Every inch of the floor is covered by a bright,
electric green carpet.  Don't blame the senior members of the Guild- the
students vote on the color scheme every year.  Bulletin boards in between
the doors are tacked with schedules and artwork and notices, and every
afternoon after classes, the pupils police the corridor so that it's fresh
for the next day's studies.  The schedule is fairly easy- three hours of
classes in the morning, two in the afternoon.  Of course, plenty of the
other hours are taken up by the hated drills in the training field.

A Classroom
  Compared to the hallway outside, this classroom is fairly boring.  The
wood of the walls is painted off-white, and the floor is bare stone, roughly
flaked into shape.  Of course, this is all done on purpose- when the room is
boring, those being taught inevitably concentrate on their teacher.  The
instructor utilizes a large easel with huge sheets of paper for
demonstrations, and the students often have to lean forward in their
uncomfortable chairs to get every detail.  On the other hand, there's only a
handful of pupils here, and each gets intense individual attention from the
teacher, resulting in superior performance and results.  It's a tried and
true method that's been working just fine for centuries, and nobody sees a
reason to change it any time soon.

Hundreds of years' worth of documentation, literature, and treatises are

guarantee graduation.  Literally thousands of books have found a home here,
and each is treasured and treated with the utmost care.  The first time a
student is careless with something borrowed from the library will be the

A Long Hallway
  This is a rather cheerful hallway- the wooden walls are painted in sunny
yellow with purple doors.  Every inch of the floor is covered by a bright,
electric green carpet.  Don't blame the senior members of the Guild- the
students vote on the color scheme every year.  Bulletin boards in between
the doors are tacked with schedules and artwork and notices, and every
afternoon after classes, the pupils police the corridor so that it's fresh
for the next day's studies.  The schedule is fairly easy- three hours of
classes in the morning, two in the afternoon.  Of course, plenty of the
other hours are taken up by the hated drills in the training field.

The Instructors' Office
  It's this room that misbehaving students are summoned to for a lecture
from Jarik or Julani.  There's merely a single desk and chair, and the
aforementioned student needs must stand and fidget while getting a gentle
dressing down.  Jarik never raises his voice, and Julani tries to follow his
example, but she has a bit of temper in her.  It doesn't quite always work
out that way.  It's probably just as well, as that makes it easy for the
pair to play good cop, bad cop.

flaked into shape.  Of course, this is all done on purpose- when the room is
boring, those being taught inevitably concentrate on their teacher.  The
instructor utilizes a large easel with huge sheets of paper for
demonstrations, and the students often have to lean forward in their
uncomfortable chairs to get every detail.  On the other hand, there's only a
handful of pupils here, and each gets intense individual attention from the
teacher, resulting in superior performance and results.  It's a tried and
true method that's been working just fine for centuries, and nobody sees a
reason to change it any time soon.

A Long Hallway
  This is a rather cheerful hallway- the wooden walls are painted in sunny
yellow with purple doors.  Every inch of the floor is covered by a bright,
electric green carpet.  Don't blame the senior members of the Guild- the
students vote on the color scheme every year.  Bulletin boards in between
the doors are tacked with schedules and artwork and notices, and every
afternoon after classes, the pupils police the corridor so that it's fresh
for the next day's studies.  The schedule is fairly easy- three hours of
classes in the morning, two in the afternoon.  Of course, plenty of the
other hours are taken up by the hated drills in the training field.

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
CLAN: At-ten-tion! KumoGami is here to get some training done!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.
