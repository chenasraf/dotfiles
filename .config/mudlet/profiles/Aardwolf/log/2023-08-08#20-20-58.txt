Fiendish Tech: yes

nothing

Yerald Tech: sweet, and the wild card indicater goes where?

Fiendish Tech: what wildcard?

## You are very hungry; your healing is reduced.
## You are dehydrated; your healing is greatly reduced.

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance. 

Type 'North' to begin your journey...

  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the path through the maze. The 
short grass is soft and spongy, which springs back into place, leaving no 
footprints nor any trace of passage. There is a stray apple lying on the 
ground, nestled comfortably underneath a section of the hedges. A soft

  This small alley was named for the people heading to fight in the arena.
Nicknamed by the citizens, this alley was renamed to Deadman's Alley. The 
alley is well lit by lanterns hanging on the walls which contain a candle 
which burns day and night in honor of the gladiators.

Deadman's Alley
  This small alley leads towards the arena. The alley is wide enough to allow a
cart to easily navigate its path, but just barely. The way is lit by small 
lanterns hanging on the side of the walls, and they burn night and day in 
memory of the gladiators who passed away.

Bloomstone's Alley
  This alley was named for Mr. Bloomstone who created this alley as place for 
his family to live. Since then it has been expanded until many families live 
here. Apartment doors cover the walls and small garden plots grow beside the 
apartment doors limiting the space you have to move about. The doors are all 
closed and locked, but perhaps you could try one of the windows.

  This small alley is bright and cheerful. It is a smaller alley and provides 
only enough room for one or two people to pass at a time. Several smaller 
apartments can be accessed from here, but their doors are closed tight.
Little potted plants grow beside each door, creating a miniature garden here

A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  The stone walls are covered with shelves that are covered with vial after 
vial of poison. Hidden from all but a chosen few, this is where the real 
rulers of Kingsholm meet in secret to discuss tactics and share stories.
These are the assassins of Kingsholm, and anyone who betrays them will pay 
the blood price.

The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the

  The epitome of the perfect military installation, the courtyard almost
hums with the activity of soldiers and their support staff.  Demons march in
drills, perfectly in step.  A chow line is set up at the far end, and the
serving Damned ladling out greasy stew each bear the mark of Nephelus on his

officers and sergeants ring through the yard, trying to be heard over each

decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and

The Court of the King
  Oddly, perhaps, this is the most peaceful place in all of Pandemonium. 
Unlike some courts, in which nobles and citizens alike do not hesitate to
scream out their opinions and protests, King Lucifer's is maintained with
quiet decorum.  This probably has something to do with the fact that
violators of this rule are likely to find their heads on a spike.  Even
honor combat is forbidden in this grand hall built of simple stone and wood.
The King and his Princes each have a permanent throne here, around which are
usually clustered petitioners.  Lucifer's, of course, towers over the rest,
though the statues carved of stone, each depicting one of those nobles, are
more colossal than anything most demons and Damned ever hope to see.

The Depths of Behemoth Castle
  Brave you are indeed, to venture so far into the home of the King.
Perhaps it's quite understandable fear that keeps most out, though not even
a single guard is posted at the stone stairs that curl their spiral way
upwards. The walls are damp and cool, and the observant might notice
rivulets of... you hope that's water, though it's rather dark... converging
and draining into the grate at the middle of the floor. It's also through
that grate that muffled screams become quite clear, sending a shiver along
listeners' spines.

[ Exits: (south) up down ]
     A small campfire burns merrily away here.

Courtyard of the Stone Palace
  The epitome of the perfect military installation, the courtyard almost
hums with the activity of soldiers and their support staff.  Demons march in
drills, perfectly in step.  A chow line is set up at the far end, and the
serving Damned ladling out greasy stew each bear the mark of Nephelus on his
or her forehead.  There is no idle chatter here, though the shouts of
officers and sergeants ring through the yard, trying to be heard over each
other.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

If you were looking for help on the Heal spell, see 'help heal spell'.

Syntax:  heal            : List heal options, keywords, and costs
         heal <keyword>  : Buy given healer option

The 'heal' command is used to interact with an in-room healer mobile, such
as the priestess north of recall.  Healers are able to sell healing and
curative spells, for a price.

Type 'heal' in a room with a healer mobile to find the charges for each
spell.  If there is no healer in the room you're in, you will be told such.

Type heal with the desired argument to purchase that spell.  It will be
cast only once; you may need to buy it again if it is unsuccessful.  Also,
note that some healers are more powerful than others.  If you are having
difficulty getting a successful casting, you may want to find a different
healer.  (Rumor has it that clan healers generally get more business and
are thus a bit more experienced than their counterparts out in the field.)

Healer mobiles will give out (for free) a few spells to players level 20
and under, if that player is willing to wait for them.  This is best
accomplished in rooms that do not have a lot of other traffic.

There is also a video which shows what to do at a healer on Aardwolf:

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

Near a stream
  Finally, a break in the scenery!  Here the grass grows very tall and stirs 
in the gentle breeze.  A stream seems to be running from the foothills to 
the west and cuts a path off to the north.  Small, tender plants grow along 
the stream's edge and the water looks cool and clear.  The whirring of 
insects fills your ears and a small frog leaps from the bank of the stream, 
where it was hidden, to snatch something from the air.  The cluster of trees 
is far to the north and, just to the east and west, the foothills appear to 
be a boundary for this vast open stretch of grassland.

In tall grass
  The grass here is quite tall, over three feet in height. It waves gently in 
the soft breezes which perpetually blow over these plains. White clouds race 
across the sky, their fanciful shapes seeming to dance to the music of the 
breezes. Chirping birds dot the sky, their eyes alert for the abundant food 
that thrives in this rich land. To the west, the ground rises to foothills 
which mark the boundary of the grasslands and, farther to the west, you can 
make out the snowcapped peaks and tree covered slopes of a mountain range.
To the north, the grasslands continue. You catch a hint of mud in the breeze 
from the south.

A slight rise
    The land begins a slow rise to the north and west here.  Continuing, in
either direction, will take you into the range of foothills.  Clusters of
flowers dot the landscape and the thick carpet of grass isn't as tall here 
as it is to the east.  The openness of this place is beginning to make you 
feel just a bit exposed and the looming mountain peaks, far to the west, 
look much too foreboding to enter.  The sounds of insects are everywhere and 
small birds race the puffy clouds moving overhead.  An eagle's scream echoes,
in the distance, and you know that it has ended the existence of something in
the world of the living.  South and east, the grassland continues and, 
scanning the horizon, you think you can see a herd of animals, though at 
this distance, it is difficult to make out what kind.

>>    *[NOEXP]* A path in the low foothills
    The foothills extend farther out here than across the visible range just
to the west.  You notice the beginnings of a stream, someplace around here,
but the grass is quite tall and hides most of the ground from view, making 
it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the stream's trek through 
the plains.  The ground is very uneven here but someone has been very 
accommodating by beating some of the tall grass into a path.  The path 
continues farther westward while, to the south, the ground slopes down 
toward more prairie.  To the north, another rise in the ground slopes back 
into the grasslands.  The mountains loom large to the west, now, their 
enormity seeming to press down on you as you travel through the foothills.

    The land begins to rise here toward the low range of foothills to the west.
A small section of the foothills extends to the south and, all around, are 
clumps of wildflowers and small shrubs.  The mountains, to the far west, look 
quite high and, the closer you get, the more ominous they seem to become.  
The sounds of small grassland creatures seem to fade from your ears, somewhat,
as you near the low foothills but you can still see birds flying high overhead.
A large eagle wings its way off to the west, probably toward its nest high on 
one of the mountaintops.

make the grass stir restlessly. The sky seems alive with dancing clouds and,
far in the distance, the hunting call of a bird of prey echoes over the 
prairie.  There is a grove of large trees to the north and east and a plume 
of smoke can be seen rising from its center. You can hear thundering hooves 
and, occasionally, you catch glimpses of herds of cattle and men on horseback

    The plant life is a bit thicker here than on most of the prairie.  Small,
scrubby bushes dot the landscape and wildflowers and clover carpet the 
ground.  This is a relatively gentle section of the foothills.  The ground 
is fairly level and very few large rocks are in sight.  The high peaks of 
the mountains rear up to the west and a cliff prohibits any further passage
in that direction.  To the north, you see flat grassland, though the cliff 
turns at this point and you see the chain of foothills continuing farther 
to the north and west. To the south, the foothills become somewhat

  To the north and east, the stream runs under the branches of the large grove

seeming to revel in the cool shade. Overhead, the sounds of squabbling and 
chirping birds fill the air and a few twigs drop from the branches of the 
towering trees. To the east, you can see the outer trunks of the grove of 
trees and the sounds of playing children and bawling cattle are very 
noticeable. The smells from a cook fire drift to you from the south, as well,
and you're sure that you can smell roasted venison and beef. Not too far off 
to the west, you can see the low range of foothills that mark the western 
boundary of this grassland and, far to the north, another visible boundary is
just in view, a forest that seems to stretch off to the east and west.

openings into a prairie dog's burrow, uninterrupted.  To the southwest, a

evidence of the violence of the rockslide. The ground is dotted with large

becomes tougher as the foothills themselves seem to have suffered some damage 
from the event. The damage does seem localized, however. To the east, the 
ground is flat and open and, to the north, you notice the foothills begin to

its way to a nest far up on the cliffs and peaks of the mountains. The

the unwary passerby.  A few scrubby bushes and twisted saplings reach upward
toward the sky and the ground is thick with high grasses and clover.  All

amount of ground water were finding a way to the surface to escape its
confines.  High overhead, the clouds seem to drift and dance to the music of

  The grass here is very tall.  The foothills directly to the west rise out
of the grasses, with small stunted trees on their slopes.  The ground on the
foothills is a bit more rocky than on the grasslands, though there is still
plenty of greenery on their slopes.  Here, the ground is not as flat as it
is farther east.  It rises toward the western foothills, and small dips and
ruts are treacherous when unseen in the tall vegetation.  The sounds of
insects filter up through the tall grasses, as well as those of the small
wild rodents which scurry through the grasses on their daily business.  From
here, you can travel north into the winding foothills, and you can just see
a dark forest in that direction, a physical boundary to this flat land.  To
the west, the foothills followed by the imposing range of mountains loom up
presenting another obvious physical boundary to the plains.  To the south
and east, the large grove of trees stands, and a herd of wild cattle race
toward it, the thundering of their hooves vibrating through the ground.  The
presence of the wild looking nomads is felt, as well, their eyes seeming to
always be on you, and you catch sight of a few, ranging out on the flanks of
the wild cattle, seeming to herd and guard the beasts from attack by natural
predators and from the more intelligent predators who only wish to deal in
hides and fresh meat.

can see the eaves of a dark forest to the far north and, to the southeast, 
the large lone grove of ancient trees rises to greet the fluffy clouds. To 
the west, the foothills march toward a high range of imposing mountains. A 
large eagle suddenly appears from the crest of one of the distant mountains, 
winging its way over the grasslands in search of a meal. Insects buzz and hop
through the tall grass and rustling from deep within the shelter of the tall 
blades speaks of small animals going about their daily lives out on this flat
plain.

small scurrying animals dot the landscape here, most seeming to lead off 
toward the south west. The reason becomes clear as you stop to listen; the 
sounds of murmuring water come from that direction. You can hear the soft 
chirping of birds high over head in the branches of the trees, and to the 
south you can see the thick trunks of the trees. The sounds of people also 
come from the south and it becomes clear that the camp of the roaming nomads

  Just on the edge of the large forest, it seems quiet, almost too quiet.
Nothing seems to be moving or living within the shadows of the giant trees.
Although there are beautiful flowers here, the silence of the forest to the 
south doesn't do anything to help improve any misgivings you might have. To 
the west, a path seems to be leading deeper into the forest while to the east 
leads a little further under the trees.

    Nearing a path in the forest, the silence of the great trees surrounds you, 
almost isolating you from the world outside. Although there may be something 
or someone in this forest, the dead leaves carpeting the ground make it hard 
to hear anything at all.  Above you, the branches of the ancient trees have 
made a dark-green, almost black, canopy that blocks out the sky.  About the 
only noise that can be heard nearby, besides the wind, is the sound of water 
coming from the west. Perhaps there is a brook or spring of some kind off 
that way. Tall grass swishes softly just under the shadow of the eaves of 
the forest to the south, while travelling east leads out to the edges of the 
forest.

providing all kinds of wildlife much needed nourishment.  The cool
life-giving waters continue to flow off to the south.  Looking into the
water, you see that life flourishes there, as it does on the rest of 
the plains.  To the east, the silent forest offers shelter from the 
elements.  On a vagrant breeze, you smell smoke from nearby but all you 
can see is some underbrush and the nearby trees.

A sparkling brook in the plains
    A break from what seems to be the steady flow of grass, this sparkling 
brook offers a cool drink and a place to sit that won't cover you in grass. 
However, if you prefer, a shadier spot of grass, to the east, would at least 
give protection from most of what nature could throw at you. To the south 
and north, the brook continues through the plains.  Just to the west, a 
large cliff looms before you and travel in that direction is all but 
impossible.

strong on the air. The sounds of buzzing insects and chirping birds can be 
heard all around. To the east the grassland seems to give way to fields, and 
you think you can see a meandering lane, however that looks too much like 
civilization to investigate just now.

Nulan'Boar tribesman on horseback, or a woman moving easily through the

  Moving cautiously through the tunnels, you soon find the source of the
light.  Several puny-looking goblins cower along the walls as you enter the
room, as though they expect to be kicked at any time.  You notice they are
holding some strange slug-like creatures that are giving off a luminary
glow.  Seeing your curiosity, a goblin stands up and places a slug on the
wall of the tunnel.  It promptly sticks in place and its glow brightens just
a bit, making your vision all the better.  Apparently this kind of light
does not hurt the goblin's eyes as does the sunlight.  From the east you
hear a snarl, and the puny goblins scramble to their feet and quickly begin
applying more slugs.

  Several larger goblins lounge around this room sleeping and playing
bones.  It's obvious they are continuously arguing over who's going to go
stand out in the tunnel and watch for intruders as they throw another hand
of bones.  It's also equally obvious to you that none of them are going to
actually go do it either.

Path to the fortress
  Moving cautiously through the tunnels, you soon find the source of the
light.  Several puny-looking goblins cower along the walls as you enter the
room, as though they expect to be kicked at any time.  You notice they are
holding some strange slug-like creatures that are giving off a luminary
glow.  Seeing your curiosity, a goblin stands up and places a slug on the
wall of the tunnel.  It promptly sticks in place and its glow brightens just
a bit, making your vision all the better.  Apparently this kind of light
does not hurt the goblin's eyes as does the sunlight.  From the east you
hear a snarl, and the puny goblins scramble to their feet and quickly begin
applying more slugs.

  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought

  A huge fight is in progress here!  Several humongous goblins are wielding
spears and charging into what appears to be some kind of earthworm, although
it's not any kind of worm you've seen before.  This thing is huge, fully
eight feet long and probably three feet around.  It's a good bet this is
what caused that hole in the rock wall.  Obviously some underground, lost
variety of worm, this creature has three six-inch-long spikes protruding
from its snout.  Rearing up, it stabs forward with its head trying to impale
the goblins, while the goblins try to hold it at bay with their spears...

  These hallways are quite nice actually.  Carved stone and chiseled
rock-laid floors give it a very sturdy and safe feel.  Goblins patrol along
and stare at you as you pass by but do not make any attempt to stop you. 
The fortress is lit the same as the outside roads, again with those strange
glowing slugs.  Up ahead you see a guard post with several goblins standing
around.

  Standing in an intersection in the fortress, you're unsure which way to
go.  Looking around you feel something grabbing onto your foot and you
glance down.  A clawed hand is reaching up through a grate in the floor.  A
low hiss rises up to your ears and you yank your foot back to the sound of
snarls and cursing.  Whatever way you decide to go it's obvious that down is
not one of the choices.

  Goblin guards walk along the stone hallway here watching out for any
trouble.  Up ahead you notice a guard station.  You stop to admire the
various tabards that adorn the walls of the hallways and notice that they
are not all goblin.  Some are orcish, drow, gnomish, and even human.  You
begin to wonder if these are friends of the goblins or past groups they have
conquered before.

  Noticing the doors north and south of you, you wonder if these could be
the guards' barracks.  It's strange that a fortress of this size, with so
many guards wandering about, does not seem to have any barracks to rest in. 
It's doubtful these will be those either though; they are far too quiet and
everyone knows goblins snore like a storm.

  Moving cautiously through the tunnels, you soon find the source of the

room, as though they expect to be kicked at any time.  You notice they are
holding some strange slug-like creatures that are giving off a luminary
glow.  Seeing your curiosity, a goblin stands up and places a slug on the
wall of the tunnel.  It promptly sticks in place and its glow brightens just
a bit, making your vision all the better.  Apparently this kind of light
does not hurt the goblin's eyes as does the sunlight.  From the east you
hear a snarl, and the puny goblins scramble to their feet and quickly begin
applying more slugs.

Before the fortress
  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?

Carved from the stone of the mountain itself, this place is built to last. 
An army wouldn't have a chance of defeating the goblins here at this
fortress, but maybe if you can find out what's going on around here you can
upset them enough to cause problems internally.

Hallway in the fortress
  As you enter a hallway in the fortress, you're still amazed that such a
fortress could remain hidden here in the mountain from the people of
Aylor for so long.  Everyone always wondered how the mountain goblins of
the Miden'nir seemed to be endless.  No matter how many were killed there
were always more.  Guess this leaves no doubt as to where they all come
from.

The forgotten halls
  Ferociously attacking you, the creatures seem to be defending this room. 
Yes, it's true that they have been trying to kill you in all of the rooms
down here, but for some reason this room seems important.  Maybe there is
something hidden here?  Or maybe this is where they are coming in.  Whatever
the reason, they definitely do not like you being here.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Tunnels stretch northwards *inside* of the mountain for as far as you can

a gigantic cavern inside of this mountain!  Many humanoid figures move about
the cavern ahead; it looks as though they are following stone roads
traveling around the sides of the cavern.  Oddly, the tunnels ahead are not
dark, though you see no torches or lanterns burning.

Path to the fortress (1481)

Before the fortress
  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?  

[ Exits: (north) east south west ]
(Red Aura) A dark dwarf is here from the Underdark inspecting the fortress.
(Red Aura) A large, well-muscled goblin stands guard here.

Hallway in the fortress (1479)

Fortress intersection [**> PK <**]
  Standing in an intersection in the fortress, you're unsure which way to
go.  Looking around you feel something grabbing onto your foot and you
glance down.  A clawed hand is reaching up through a grate in the floor.  A
low hiss rises up to your ears and you yank your foot back to the sound of
snarls and cursing.  Whatever way you decide to go it's obvious that down is
not one of the choices.
 
A small sign is bolted to the nearby wall. Better read it.

  This is another room made with excellent craftsmanship, carved stone
walls hollowed out of the rock mountain with a chiseled stone-laid floor. 
Really wonderful work, but you have no time to enjoy it, considering that
the things that dwell here want to kill you.

(Red Aura) A ferocious warg runs around here frothing at the mouth.

difficult to know which way to go and could be hiding numerous amounts of
things to make the course more treacherous.  The journey onward must be
proceeded with caution.

Tunnels stretch northwards *inside* of the mountain for as far as you can

a gigantic cavern inside of this mountain!  Many humanoid figures move about
the cavern ahead; it looks as though they are following stone roads
traveling around the sides of the cavern.  Oddly, the tunnels ahead are not
dark, though you see no torches or lanterns burning.

Hallway in the fortress
  As you enter a hallway in the fortress, you're still amazed that such a
fortress could remain hidden here in the mountain from the people of
Aylor for so long.  Everyone always wondered how the mountain goblins of
the Miden'nir seemed to be endless.  No matter how many were killed there
were always more.  Guess this leaves no doubt as to where they all come
from.

Hallway in the fortress
  As you enter a hallway in the fortress, you're still amazed that such a
fortress could remain hidden here in the mountain from the people of
Aylor for so long.  Everyone always wondered how the mountain goblins of
the Miden'nir seemed to be endless.  No matter how many were killed there
were always more.  Guess this leaves no doubt as to where they all come
from.

Just inside the fortress [**> PK <**]
  Stepping through the doors into the fortress, you aren't bothered by the
guards at all.  You release your grip on your weapon, having expected them
to at least question you about your intentions here or who you might be. 
Carved from the stone of the mountain itself, this place is built to last. 
An army wouldn't have a chance of defeating the goblins here at this
fortress, but maybe if you can find out what's going on around here you can
upset them enough to cause problems internally.

  Goblin guards walk along the stone hallway here watching out for any

various tabards that adorn the walls of the hallways and notice that they
are not all goblin.  Some are orcish, drow, gnomish, and even human.  You
begin to wonder if these are friends of the goblins or past groups they have
conquered before.

Hallway in the fortress
  Noticing the doors north and south of you, you wonder if these could be
the guards' barracks.  It's strange that a fortress of this size, with so
many guards wandering about, does not seem to have any barracks to rest in. 
It's doubtful these will be those either though; they are far too quiet and
everyone knows goblins snore like a storm.

  This room appears to be that of a very important goblin.  Sitting at a
desk busily writing away on piles of parchment, he doesn't even bother to
look up at you.  "I suppose you want to see the king like everyone else?" 
"Hmmfph, no one sees the king.  He's very busy and cannot be disturbed.

Hallway in the fortress
  Noticing the doors north and south of you, you wonder if these could be
the guards' barracks.  It's strange that a fortress of this size, with so
many guards wandering about, does not seem to have any barracks to rest in. 
It's doubtful these will be those either though; they are far too quiet and
everyone knows goblins snore like a storm.

Fortress intersection [**> PK <**]
  Standing in an intersection in the fortress, you're unsure which way to
go.  Looking around you feel something grabbing onto your foot and you
glance down.  A clawed hand is reaching up through a grate in the floor.  A
low hiss rises up to your ears and you yank your foot back to the sound of
snarls and cursing.  Whatever way you decide to go it's obvious that down is
not one of the choices.
 
A small sign is bolted to the nearby wall. Better read it.

  This room is filled with screaming goblin brats.  Several matrons run
around frantically trying to keep track of them all.  You can hardly stand
being in the room at all, as the noise is deafening.  The little brats are
punching and pulling each others' hair, picking their noses and wiping their
butts on anything they can get ahold of.  Disgusting little creatures, these
goblins.

The triage area
  You have entered the medical triage center of the clinic. Here, patients are 
evaluated to determine the criticality of their wounds or injuries. From

treatment. Like the rest of the clinic, this room is at maximum capacity.
The personnel is in a rush to get people diagnosed and on to the correct

The Waiting Room
  The clinic's waiting room continues here. The builders of the clinic 
obviously kept in mind that there will be times when the clinic is at maximum
capacity, and people will be required to wait. This would also be why they 
decided to construct plastic benches into the wall as well, which now 
provides plenty of seating for those waiting to see a doctor. The lighting 
above is flickering, giving the room a somewhat spooky aura. The waiting area

swirls of mist in every direction. It is dark and damp here; you can barely 
see what is in the room with you. There are exits in all directions.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

  The stream runs gently through the grasslands, its waters cool and clear.
Small fish swim past, and the buzz of insects is louder near the water.  A
small, green frog leaps from its place of concealment, snatching one of the
unlucky insects from the air.  The stream continues to the north and west at
this point, and the grass here is shorter than you would have guessed for
such a wild grassland.

A cool stream in the plains
  The vegetation is thick around the stream here. Tender shoots of grass and 
small yellow mushrooms cluster thickly, providing numerous hiding places for 
small animals and insects. Looking to the north, you can see the stream 
running under the branches of the large grove of trees. Small fish swim 
toward the shade and a few frogs dance on the water, lazily snatching insects
from the air. Several birds glide lazily overhead, and several more appear to
be winging their way to the trees. A low range of foothills can be seen off 
to the west, as well as more open grassland.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

  Standing knee-deep in the murkish water, you feel the curious sensation
of unseen creatures slithering against you.  The soft ripples trailing
across the water are rythmically entrancing, but you blink back to reality
when you see the reptilian creature which forms the ripples.  With a shiver,
you move on, wanting to be out of the mist-laden swamp.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

Inside the Main Courtyard of the Castle
  The courtyard continues further into the castle.  The flagstones
themselves are quarried from a black stone, polished by the passing of time
and booted feet into an inky sheen.  All around the courtyard, demons roam,
going about their business, talking in their guttural rasping tongue.  All
manner of dread abomination walks, slithers and crawls; their forms a
corruption of many different creatures, twisted together into a mocking
semblance of their former lives.  All around the edges of the courtyard,
large archways vault upwards, calling you into their maw.

  This part of the castle seems to be subtly different.  The architecture
has taken on a much more functional look, not the gothic, spires and arches
of before, but something altogether more practical.  Black marble has given
way to slate grey stone, closely cobbled within the walls.  Weapons also
adorn the walls, looking well looked after and very sharp.

  The barracks continue on, further into the castle.  Slate grey walls
close around you, adorned with many very deadly looking weapons.  The dark
ground looks very well worn, as if many boots had worn it smooth.  From
within the barracks, you hear the guttural sounds of the demons, talking

  The barracks continue on, further into the castle.  Slate grey walls
close around you, adorned with many very deadly looking weapons.  The dark
ground looks very well worn, as if many boots had worn it smooth.  From

amongst themselves.

  Taking a deep breath, you prepare to enter the arena.  How many before
you have stood here, savouring their last few lungfuls of fetid air.  How
many before have seen their life flash in front of their eyes?  With a grim
resolve, you make a vow, that this will not be your lot, that somehow, this
place will not destroy you, that you will overcome.  With that in mind, you
tread boldly on...

as if from the bloody ground, that soon again, it will feast upon the flesh

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

Slithering through the grasslands, a common grass snake looks for a meal.

Nearing the ruins
  The path gains more light to the north as it approaches the ruins in the 
distance. To the south, the path is darker and more covered with roots of 
trees, mossy coverings, and leaves. Above, the Forest of Everwood bustles as 
animals and unknowing travellers run by, oblivious to the existence of this 
place.

Under a crumbled archway
  A crumbled archway stands here separating the grassy forest to the south from
the cracked stone floors of the ruins to the north. The arch of the archway 
is nearly entirely gone, leaving behind a partial pillar 7 feet high on the 
west and a partial pillar 3 feet high on the east. Based on the structure of 
the pillars, the archway would likely have stood over 15 feet high when this 
structure was in its prime.

Among the ruins
  Crumbled pillars and walls surround this area on all sides. Faded marble 
tiles pepper the grass and weeds which have grown up to envelop this 
structure. The shape of the ruins and amount of ground they cover indicate 
that a great structure once stood here. Located far north from path covered 
by the trees of Everwood Forest, the light has direct access here and 
illuminates the ruins and the dust unearthed by the occasional passing 
traveller, coating the atmosphere in a surreal cloud. When all is still, one 
can make out the faint sound of resonating melodic tones which emanate from 
the ruins themselves.

A stone platform (G)
  The faint reverberations and resonances heard elsewhere in the ruins seem to 
emanate from this place and swell in magnitude. Where the rest of the ruins 
are in pieces and dust, this platform is nearly entirely whole and uncracked.
The platform is circular in shape and is etched with numerous musical

Beginning of marble path
  A wide, immaculately laid marble path stretches north from this place toward 
a shining palace. Along the path, beautiful green fields and flower patches 
grow in gardens bordering both the east and west. The occasional child 
scampers across the path to his or her delight, chasing flower petals and 
butterflies on the breeze. The palace itself is a shining white structure 
framed by a large dome and hand-carved statues of singers, musicians, and 
dancers inlaid upon each of its corners and edges. Above this walkway stands 
a 15 foot marble archway, to the exact proportions of the crumbled archway in
the ruins, had it still been intact. And in fact, the palace ahead is to the 
exact proportion of the remaining base stones left standing in the ruins. At 
the center of the tiles on this spot, a plaque bears an inscription.

Path through the gardens
  This portion of the gardens imbues a sense of tranquility. Faint music can be
heard from the Palace to the north when a production is underway, and the 
fountain to the north gives a sense of flow and peace. To the west is the 
Garden of Duke Nhoukym, and to the east is the Garden of Lady Maltesa.

Nearing the palace
  This northern part of the garden, dedicated to the Royal Children, is more 
grandiose in nature than the southern section which was dedicated to the 
Nobles. The marble is a little brighter here, and the gardens on either side 
of the path exude a colourful vibrance not seen in the green gardens to the 
south. The grandeur and opulence of the palace to the north is nearly 
overwhelming. To the west is the Garden of Princess Amepsmamptra, and to the 
east is the Garden of Prince Amepsmamptrer.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

Beside a wide river
  The plains come to an end here, next to a wide, swift flowing river. The 
waters look cool and inviting, and far out in the water, large fish leap to 
snatch unfortunate insects from the air. The ground is rich with green 
vegetation, reeds and short grasses stirring in the breezes which are cooler 
here by the water's edge. Thick vegetation blocks the way eastward, and the 
ground becomes dangerously marshy in that direction also. To the west the 
river continues, winding lazily along the southern edge of the plains, its 
waters providing nourishment for this wide open expanse of grassland.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

An intersection of hallways
  Two different hallways come to an intersection here. Due to the sufficient 
lighting, you can see nearly to the end of each hallway. A janitor or a 
doctor occasionally passes by, on their way to an unknown destination. The 
noises here are loud, since the intersection funnels them to this single 
point. The hallways continue in all directions. There is a small door in the 
floor beneath your feet, and a stairwell that leads upwards to the second 
floor of the clinic.

light hanging above that needs changing; it is flickering very rapidly. It 
makes you dizzy as you try to navigate through the clinic. You consider 
letting a janitor know the lights need to be replaced, but it would be 
impossible for them not to know this already. There's a small door to the

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:

Players may buy and customize private areas of their own.  This is not
an inexpensive process, but is available to anyone that has the required
resources.

Several features come with owning a manor:

- When you have a private room, you also have a command called 'home',
  which works the same as recall but instead takes you back to your manor.
- Married players can share the expenses and benefits of a manor; only one
  player can be registered as the owner, however.
- Every manor includes a porch- a 'waiting room' of sorts which allows
  other players to wait to be allowed inside.  (See 'help invite'.)
- While in your room, you can 'look outside' to see who is in your waiting
  room that you might want to invite in.
- A player in your 'waiting room' can ring the doorbell (see 'help ring'),
  and the manor owner/spouse will be notified.
- Your room comes with a free fireplace and fountain and may be customized
  in several ways (see 'help manorupgrade').
- Private rooms are 'safe'; you cannot be attacked unless you purposely
  toggle this flag off, and then only by players you invite inside.
- Manors can be sold to other players; this can even involve the transfer
  of Quest and Trivia points (see 'help mu-transfer').
 
For information on how to request a new manor see 'help manor purchase'.
For information on available upgrade options  see 'help manorupgrade'.
For information on available locations        see 'help mu-locations'
For a general list of manor help files, type 'index mu-'

*** Please note that all upgrades need to be submitted to the Imms on
the upgrades board. To easily create an upgrade use the manor upgrade
generator at: http://bit.ly/aard_manors

What are clans?
See 'help clan'. Basically, they're a group of (hopefully) like-minded 
individuals who work together and help each other with the game. 


How do I join a clan?
For general information, read this article.  Joining a clan depends on the
specific clan- each clan has their own entry requirements and joining 
procedures.  At the very least, you'll probably have interviews, to get to
know the clan and its members and for them to get to know you.  There's
also usually some other steps in the process, like doing something to help
the clan or show your MUD knowledge.  Check out a clan's website (see
'help claninfo') in order to find more information. 


What are the benefits of joining a clan?
Another benefit is that clan members generally help each other out. You can
ask questions, learn more about the game, get spellups, find grouping
partners, and more.  Most clans have a private area where they store
information that can help make the game easier.  Being a member of a clan
may give you a positive reputation to other players, too.

PK (player-killing, see 'help pk') clans have closed clan equipment you
can only acquire by being a member of that clan, and also have the ability
to engage in combat against other players.

Clans also have the ability to have morgues and tend to get one as soon as
they possibly can; if you die and your clan has a morgue, you'll never
have to go find your corpse again. (Your corpse will be moved to the clan
hall and you'll be able to loot it at your leisure.)


What are the drawbacks of joining a clan?
If you join a PK clan, you can get PKed.  If you join a clan with a bad 
reputation, you can be ignored, called a moron, and generally considered 
an idiot based on that clan's reputations.  As a member of a clan, you'll 
generally be expected to contribute to the clan- group with lower level 
members, donate gold, help defend (if you're part of a PK clan), and 
participate in clan activities such as festivals or meetings. 


I'm scared of PK, does this mean I should avoid clans?
Nope, not at all!  Player killing has limits- it can generally only occur
in specific rooms you can usually avoid if desired.  Unless you instigate
a fight, you can only be attacked by players within 10 levels of your own
level.  There are almost no penalties for pk deaths, and no loss of
equipment, so even in a PK clan, you may forget you're able to be targeted
by other players.

Alternatively, you can also choose to join a NoPK clan.  The NoPK setting
can be seen in the far right column of 'clist', and next to the clan name
in 'claninfo <clanname>'.  NoPK clans trade some of their privacy for the
protection of not being able to PK or be PKed.  Anyone can visit most of a
NoPK clan hall (save for a few private rooms) and freely buy and wear that
clan's equipment.


How do I choose which clan to join?
There are several factors that can help influence your choice.  The biggest
one is going to be who's in the clan.  Are your friends mostly in the same
clan?  If so, chances are you'll probably enjoy being there, too.  Talk to
the members of a clan- see what they think.

The clan's website is also a very good source of information.  Clans are
designed with a specific theme or purpose in mind.  Since Aardwolf is not
a roleplay-intensive game, theme basically usually helps determine things
like the clan's room and item descriptions, ranks, and so forth, though it
may also form some of the rules/guidelines for the clan.  Requirements for
joining, what is expected of clan members, and similar policies are also
listed on clan webpages.

There is a clan specifically designed as an introduction to clan life for
new players- see 'help boot' for more information.


What happens if I change my mind and I chose the wrong clan?
First off, talk with your clan's leaders.  They can often help with doubts,
disputes, or other problems you may be having with other clan members or
the clan itself.  You might even bring about a change to make things feel
more comfortable- you never know unless you discuss it.

If this doesn't work and the clan is absolutely not what you expected, not
the right fit, or you're generally unhappy and it's not going to change,
you're not stuck- you can leave at any time (and for any reason).  Leaving
a clan flags you as an Outcast (see 'help outcast').  The only penalties
for this is that you will have to pay a fee to remove the Outcast flag
before you can join another clan, and you are vulnerable to player-killing
(within normal pk limitations) from members of any clan.  

If you find out the one clan you tried isn't a good fit, this is no
big deal;  however, if you move from clan to clan and outcast quickly and
often, you may get the reputation of a 'clan hopper' and the remaining
clans may be less likely to take you as a new member.  (Would you want to
spend the time recruiting someone and helping them if you think they're
going to leave at the first hint of trouble?)


What if I want to start my own clan?
This is a VERY difficult thing to do. New clans are RARELY accepted and 
only when they are called for- currently, once every several years (though
there is no formula for when or how it will happen).  Before the most
recent clan was added in October of 2011, a single clan was added in 2006.
The last batch of multiple clans added at once happened in 2003.

Starting a clan also needs hundreds of millions of gold invested in the
beginning, just for the initial design.  This usually means new clans in
particular also need lots of players,  particularly heroes/superheroes that
can sit and raise money for the clan, as well as help defend when the time
comes.

Basically, don't expect to start a clan of your own anytime soon.  Don't go
around saying that you are going to start one and collecting donations.
Don't pretend you're a real clan.  If you want to start a clan in the
future, sit down, talk quietly with your friends, and start hoarding the
hundreds of millions of gold you're going to need. Meanwhile, you can go
join another clan- maybe you'll find out it's not so bad somewhere else.

Boot Camp is, in essence, a clan made by experienced players for the purpose
of helping newer players. We take in newer players to help them along and 
give them a taste of what clan life is like until they either outgrow us or 
decide to stay with us as staff members.
 
Before applying you will need to have reached at least lvl 15 and have 
completed the Aardwolf Academy goal.
 
Our application process is pretty simple and should take a maximum of 1 week to 
complete. To begin the process start by posting a note on board personal 
to boot announcing your interest in joining, along with a little about 
yourself. An example application note can be found in HELP 
BOOT-APPLICATION.
 
After posting your note you will receive a reply note giving you further 
instructions on how to continue with your application process. 
 
If you are tier 3, 7x, 201 or higher in level and wish to apply as staff, 
you may begin your application process by simply writing us a note. We will 
respond with a note on how to continue.

The mandate of Boot is to help new players, therefore, once a member has
reached the level stated above (T3, 7x, 201), the player will be given
the choice to continue on as a staff member or be assisted in the transition
to a new clan life outside of Boot. It is assumed that by that level, Boot
has taught the player everything that they will need to know and in fact
they are a newbie no more.

This is where we cover what your application should consist of and give you
an example application.

All applications should be on Personal Board and addressed to Boot. For
the Subject, please reference the words "application" or "joining". Now just
like a job application, you wouldn't just put "I want the job!". We'd like a
bit more information as the following example shows:

Type: "forum personal"
Current forum changed to Personal. You can read and write in this forum.
Type: "note write"
The recipient of this post must NOT include: "all"
To      :  boot
Subject :  Joining Boot
Enter your post. Type END on an empty line to finish.

Hello, my name is Barney.
I have been playing for 15 years and I really enjoy doing quests and
campaigns. :)
I would like to join bootcamp because I would like some extra help
learning where to level.
I'm pretty active, I really enjoy the game and hope to make some new
friends. :D

The above is an example of a good application. Here is an example of a bad one:
"i would like to join boot camp, it is awsome"

Not much information at all is given there and it doesn't look as though
a lot of effort was put into writing it. This doesn't give your potential
future clannies a lot of incentive to get to know you better. Most clans
would prefer something along the lines of the first note for an application
(or in many cases, quite a bit more than that). We here at Boot Camp are not
as strict, but we do want to help you learn to write application notes now so
that you know the basics for clan applications as you continue your
Aard career.

Loner is a special flag that is added to a character which prevents them
from being recruited into other clans.  This is a good way to show that you
are not interested in joining any clan.  You will show as a Loner in who,
whois, finger, etc., as if a member of any other clan; however, Loners are
not able to take part in clan wars. Loner status does not affect PK status,
a character will need to turn on OPK in order to participate in those 
activities.

Unlike other settings on a character, Loner is not a flag to be taken
lightly; once set, it may only be removed when you tier (not remort) or 
after 1 year of real life time has passed. Removal of the Loner flag leaves 
you unclanned; you are not outcast as with other clans and do not have to 
pay any fees.

The Loner flag must be set by an Immortal (level 205 or higher).  He/she
will make certain that this choice is what you desire.  Only Lasher may
remove the Loner flag; you must post a note to him on Personal after you
are done with the tier process to have it removed.  You do not need to stay
level 1 until your loner flag is removed, however.

Centuries have passed.
Rumors of Stendarr's imprisonment abound.
The Watchmen have nearly died out.
  
Chaos sweeps across the lands of Aardwolf leaving devastation in its wake.
It is time once again for the Watchmen to take up arms and recruit an army.
Perilous journies await the dauntless Watchmen and malevolent forces work to
thwart these guardians and turn them from righteousness! Against even these
terrible odds, Stendarr's children MUST prevail and break His bonds!
  
  
Stendarr's army invites those whose hearts are pure to lead Aardwolf into a
new era!
    
Clan Watchmen has no alignment requirements, nor does Stendarr demand 
regular tributes of gold or quest points. A statutory clan tax based upon
auction earnings, sale proceeds, and mob spoils funds the holy war.  Clan
members are not required to join committees, wars, raids, or PK activities.
We take pride in supporting every clan member in the pursuit of his or her
personal goals within the guidelines of our clan theme. 
  
Do you wish to herald Stendarr's restoration and serve as guardian and
protector of our realm?
Do you want Stendarr's children to stand with you as you achieve victory and
gather round you if you suffer defeat?
Adventurer, you seek Clan |Watchmen|.
Clan |Watchmen| awaits you.

:::The Revolution::: began during the darkest days of the
Great Cleansing, during which time there was great malice
and prejudice against the lower castes.

The movement started as several small, clandestine groups
of aggrieved commoners began plotting against the greed and
selfishness that was threatening to destroy their hopes
for an improved way of life. Inevitably, word of these
meetings reached the ears of the King and his closest
advisors.

Soon thereafter, as the gatherings continued to grow in
both size and reputation, they were infiltrated and members
began disappearing at an alarming rate. In short order, a
Royal Decree was passed ordering the eradication of
all rebels.

Great screams of torment were heard throughout the land as
both revolutionaries and innocents alike were mercilessly
tortured and slaughtered for their beliefs in equality.

As the ocean of dead began to rise, the revolt surged in
numbers, recruiting advocates and finding allies from all
walks of life. As darkness mingled with light, education
with experience, this faction moved underground and developed
into a seriously vexing problem for the Kingdom.

Rumors are that this tenacious organization continues to this
very day, and that their quantity and clout continue to grow.
The upper castes have yet to understand the true motives
behind what they have appropriately labeled as
:::LoquI:::, the Outspoken.

Since the very beginning of civilization, life in all its forms has been 
marked with a constant desire for betterment and a continual yearning for 
knowledge and power.

Throughout history, many races of the world have sought, in various ways, 
to achieve true power through the use of knowledge. By poking and digging 
into dark and mysterious corners of the globe, by exploring new and 
dangerous lands, or by the tame act of simply reading a book.

A few of these select knowledge seekers have come together to form a
studious group of scholars known to the outside world only as "The
Seekers."

Additionally, the Seekers will gladly share their knowledge of the world
and its places. If any person has a question about an area, where to find 
this object, or how to defeat that dragon, the Seekers will give the
answer or work to find it.

When the Bore was drilled into a place outside the Pattern, a dark
presence used the opening to touch the world. This presence, which named
itself Shai'tan, had been imprisoned outside of time and creation by the
Creator of the universe.  Although the dark presence is something beyond
the mortal realm and outside our complete understanding, one mortal word
seems to embody Shai'tan -- "evil." Since his first touch, he has been
known by many names, though most commonly as the Dark One. He is known as
the Great Lord of the Dark by those who follow him truly.

Ishamael, also known as Baalzamon, was the Great Lord's top
Captain-General. When the Great Lord and his High Council were trapped
within the resealed Bore, only Baalzamon was left free. Baalzamon executed
the Great Lord's will by influencing his most loyal followers. He forced
them to combine into a clan. This clan is a task force whose job is to
bring about the Great Lord's return. Its members are known as the Children
of Baalzamon.

The Children of Baalzamon seek to bring about the return of the Great Lord
by any means necessary. If this means waging war upon the entire world,
then so be it. If it means ending world hunger to gain status and
influence, then so be it. Beyond all, the clan will never become stagnant.
It will continue to gain influence, power, or whatever is necessary to
bring about the one dream, the one nightmare, the return of the Great
Lord.

The clan has three factions: Ebony Dagger, Black Ajah, and Darkfriends.
Ebony Dagger includes the warriors and thieves whose dark whispers keep
kingdoms awake at night. Black Ajah gathers mages, clerics, and
psionicists who experiment and practice with the Dark Powers given to them
by their Master. Darkfriends are those who most desire status, influence,
and power.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Whitewind Avenue (G)
  You stand amidst a very crowded portion of Whitewind Avenue.  To the
north is a large mass of people who are waiting in line to speak with
Aylor's great and noble quest master.  To the south even more crowds
gather to find the treasures of Grandmarket Boulevard.

  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

>>    The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.  

[ Exits: north east south west ]
(White Aura) The local banker, Phreshnar, sits behind a table with a hole in the center.

>>    Whitewind Avenue (G)
  You stand on Whitewind Avenue just south of Grandmarket Boulevard. 
Farther south, Whitewind meets up with Darksoil Path in a soft merging of
roadways.  The road here on Whitewind is as white as snow.  You cannot
imagine the thousands of footsteps that the road has endured, but it seems
no worse for wear.  In fact, the road is a pristine snow white and quite
beautiful.

  Walking along this section of Whitewind Avenue, strollers can experience
a pleasant aroma of earth and flowers carried on the breeze.  People say
that the smell in the air is an enchantment, part of the mysticism of Aylor
that occurs even in the worst of storms.  The avenue is a pristine white,
which, with its scent, can't help but refresh even the most weary of
adventurers.

  The pure white avenue beneath your feet trademarks the road from which
its name originates.  The road travels north and south, this portion of it
laying between Darksoil Path and Faeriefog Lane.  To the south and west, you
see a large residential part that hosts a large attraction that the local
residents are very proud.  Beyond the houses to the east, you can hear the
laughter of children and the splashing of water in the distance.  Residents
and adventurers make their way past, some exploring, others searching for
their future legacies.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

>>    Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

In Black Cat Tower (G)
  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

reverie.  They tumble in the sky, their shrill cries stark against the
background noise of the gently rolling ocean.  Children play in the street,
their smiles grinning at you from faces caked in sand...

  The sand from the beach blows gently across the road...  People moving
back and forth under the bright sunlight.  The air has a salty tang upon it,
a gentle breeze blowing in from the ocean, memories of galleons and gulls
called to mind.

Near Oasis Island
  The waters are strangely gentler closer to the island, as if having spent
all their anger and fury on travellers attempting to cross, but not caring
once the journey is done.

Eastern beach of Oasis Island
  The sun-warmed sand of the eastern beaches ends here, the golden sand
darkened by the tide of the waves.  A few rocks peek above the water's
surface from time to time as the tide recedes.

  Inland, the beaches yield to fields of lush green grass.  The island lies
too far away from the main continents for birds to travel here, and only
seeds and insects have somehow made their way to the island oasis.

  You are on the most beautifully kept and built road you've ever seen. 
Each individual stone appears so clean it may have been scrubbed with a
toothbrush, and is set so flawlessly you can barely tell where one stone
ends and the next begins.  The road travels for what appears to be a fairly
short distance towards the north, heading for the largest dome you've ever
seen.  Could that be the infamous Gladiator's Arena?

Outside the Arena (G)
  The road you are on remains nearly perfect in every way, and cleaner than
any you've seen before; yet now you can see signs of traffic on the cobbled
stones, where decades of long hard use have begun to wear the stones a
little TOO smooth.  In front of you is the single largest building you've
ever seen; easily ten stories tall, and at least eight thousand feet in
diameter, this perfect dome is reputed to have been built so well that a
whisper spoken anywhere inside would carry to any other part of the
building.  The walls are unbelievably smooth, and so clean that the sun
practically reflects off of the dark grey granite.  An enormous archway to
the north, fifty feet at its peak and twice as wide, provides access to the
dome.

A gigantic man stands here, guarding the doors into the Gladiator's Arena.
The Entrance Guard gets a greedy gleam in his eyes.
The Entrance Guard exclaims, "Welcome to the Gladiator's Arena, sir! For a

 warriors, and... uhm... others the land has to offer!"

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

  The vegetation here is odd.  All the plants seem to have a slight reddish
tint to them, no doubt due to the red dust which permeates this land.  Even
the water here has a sickly crimson color, polluted by the high iron content
of this entire continent, thus giving birth to the name the Blood Swamps. 
Loud cackles can be heard coming from east of here, where a blood red strata
of rock rises from the swamp and into the heavens.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

A Path at the Foot of a Mountain
  A grove of spindly pine trees passes as a forest at the foot of the mountain 
to the north. The tree branches are knobby with short needles that scratch 
you as you walk the trail. The air is crisp, and the oxygen thin as you 
follow the trail through the woods. The path leads north and east from here.

  Knobby tree branches scratch at your face and arms as you follow the 
wandering trail through a grove of spindly pine trees. The air is clean and

  The trail stops at the base of a very tall, rocky mountain. Looking around, 
there appears to be no other alternative than to return whence you came.
However, a glance upwards reveals that the rock wall has what appears to be

what appears to be a mountain ledge not ten feet above your head.

A Kobalos palace guard opens the portcullis and lets you enter the palace.
Entrance to the Palace
  The grandest of caverns is reserved for the King and Queen of the Kobaloi.
Relief sculpture has been carved into the walls on each side of the hallway.
The carvings however have been defaced so that what was once the work of 
another race now has the tracings of amateurish Kobaloi artistry.

lighting up the room. Kobaloi are milling about, hoping to petition the King

others standing alone. They are all waiting in the hope of gaining audience

The Mess Hall
  At mid-day, the Peace Keepers converge on the mess hall, in the expectation 
of a good meal. The cook works in a vented corner of the room, at a hearth 
where a huge pot of fish stew is boiling. Locally made ale is served with the
stew, and generally no one ever complains or tires of the lack of variety.
Good food is good food, and that is all.

The Keepers of the Peace
  You are standing in the cavern designated for the Keepers of the Peace. The 
Peace Keepers are responsible for the defense of the Keep, and for settling 
disputes between neighbours. They also hunt down thieves who dare to try to 
steal from the Temple, Palace or even the Ponds. A set of stone steps lead 
immediately to the upper level of the Peace Keepers' cavern.

  The trail levels out and leads along the east face of the mountain. A safety 
wall, built of stone and mortar, borders the trail across from the mountain 
face. Without it, one might easily fall several hundred feet and such a fall 
would surely be mortal.

  This section of the holy retreat appears to be the main place of worship for 
the Kobaloi. Several rows of pews are separated by an isle which ends at a 
dais and a high set podium from which sermons are read. Although deep within 
the cavern, the room is brightly lit by torches along the walls.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

this field is still be used as a training center, and

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

Boot Clan Public Hall (G)
  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you

enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Bottomless Chasm (G)
  There's literally no end to this chasm.  A falling being will never hit
bottom- kind of a mixed blessing- and the canyon continues in a perfect
circle around Pandemonium City.  Even those who can fly have trouble here,
battered and tossed about by stinking, gale force winds.  Were it not for
the bridge above, the City would be almost impossible to reach.

City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the

the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of

wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light

entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks

Pandemonium Marketplace
  Easily the busiest place in the city, the Pandemonium Marketplace is a
broad square of flagstone easily covering half an acre.  Not only shops are
available here, but kiosks can be, and are, set up as well.  Every item
imaginable is available here, and at all hours of the day and night.  The
buzz of deals being struck can be constantly heard, interspersed with a
shout now and then as those dickering get a bit excited.

  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris.  Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur is
never eliminated completely.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

  Oddly, perhaps, this is the most peaceful place in all of Pandemonium. 
Unlike some courts, in which nobles and citizens alike do not hesitate to
scream out their opinions and protests, King Lucifer's is maintained with
quiet decorum.  This probably has something to do with the fact that
violators of this rule are likely to find their heads on a spike.  Even
honor combat is forbidden in this grand hall built of simple stone and wood.
The King and his Princes each have a permanent throne here, around which are
usually clustered petitioners.  Lucifer's, of course, towers over the rest,
though the statues carved of stone, each depicting one of those nobles, are
more colossal than anything most demons and Damned ever hope to see.

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

A shady spot on the plains (1180)

Near a grove of ancient trees
  You find yourself on the outer edge of a large grove of trees. They seem 
ancient, their thick, grey-brown trunks big around enough to build a house 
within and reaching toward the open sky. The branches are heavy with 
greenery, and the sounds of chirping and squabbling birds drift down from the
treetops. Other sounds come to you from within the ancient grove. The sounds 
of children playing, a trickle of water, and the occasional call of an adult.
A small stream runs in from the west, disappearing into the grove of trees, 
and its crystal clear waters reveal darting fish and small insects. The soft 
carpet of grass and clover is cool and damp to the touch, and this looks like
a nice spot to rest before continuing the trek across the plains.

Inside a hidden clearing
    The clearing looks even larger now that you are inside the grove of 
ancient trees.  A sparkling lake is a few feet to one side and the stream 
empties into its still waters. You can see many people moving around here, 
some going to and from the lake, either swimming or bringing back pails of 
water to the tents which dot the clearing. The source of the smoke is 
evident, now, as you make note of a large bonfire with several spits of meat 
roasting over it. You can, also, make out a paddock, of sorts, where several 
horses are hobbled.  At the far end of the clearing, a large bull hide tent
stands, as if to watch over the dark-skinned inhabitants as they go about 
their daily lives.

A path alongside the lake
  Many small plants and reeds grow among the grass here.  The lake to the
north looks clean and pure, and the sounds of frogs and small insects
surround you.  Underfoot, the vegetation is soft and damp.  You can see
several of the Nulan'Boar people going about their business between the
tents to the east, and the smell of roast meat is heavy in the air.  The
clearing looks much like the rest of the grasslands, except for the
gathering of tents, and you are puzzled by this single grove of trees in the
middle of a flat prairie.

Path through the scattered tents
  Tents are set up haphazardly through this stretch of grassland.  There is
no clear or visible path through the tents.  It is as if the inhabitants of
the clearing do not care much about structure, at least in terms of where
things are placed.  There are a lot of people moving around here, some armed
with bows and spears, others carry baskets, or blankets and babies.  The low
murmur of their voices is tinged with an exotic accent and you can see a
peacefulness about them.  The tents all seem to be made of bull or deer
skin, and look quite roomy.  While large, the tents are still smaller than
the one to the north and east, which seems to dominate the view within the
camp.  The smells of roasting meat begin to take their toll on you, and you
realize that you are becoming very ravenous.

A large cook fire
  As you move into the firelight, it becomes apparent that this is the
source of all the smoke and smells of cooking.  The large fire is surrounded
by men and women turning spits, kneading dough, and cutting meats.  It
appears that all the cooking for the entire camp is done at this one large
fire.  Spits are loaded with roasting haunches of deer and cow.  Several
flat rocks serve as an oven where large, flat pieces of dough become some
sort of bread, and there are even a few glowing kettles positioned very
close to the fire, steaming and bubbling.  From the smells coming from one
of these you guess that the herbs and nuts that some of the women of the
tribe bring in are becoming a stew or soup of some sort.  The fire itself
does not use much wood.  It seems to utilize more readily available fuel
sources, such as dried dung from the herds of animals, and dried grasses. 
There are a few chunks of wood scattered among the other sources of fuel,
but they are not the most important part of the fire's makeup.  From here,
you can travel west into a scattering of tents, or north, deeper into the
camp of the Nulan'Boar.

feed on the tender shoots of plant life which grow densely alongside the
lake.  Several small children and a few adult women, all dressed in leather
clothing, with tanned skin and dark hair, come to dip reed basketsful of 
water from the lake.  As you continue to move across the lake, you can make

  While not exactly set apart from all the others, this tent does have
space around it.  It is much larger and more ornate than the plain tents you
have seen in the Nulan'Boar camp.  Out here the ground is flat, but there is
grass growing, unlike in the center of the camp.  There appears to be smoke
drifting from a hole in the roof of the tent, and a sense of power seems to
surround the dwelling.  As you look over the view from here, you see a few
people, both men and women, enter and exit the tent.  Many of the women who
enter the tent are dressed in what appear to be robes of soft white calf's
hide, and all have a peaceful look about them.  All of the men who visit are
armed, and most have a gait that suggests they are more comfortable on
horseback.  Wherever this is, it must be a place of importance.

>>    *[NOEXP]* A path through the tents of the Nulan'Boar
    You find yourself walking among a scattering of bull hide tents. There 
seems to be no particular path through the structures and you have to wind 
your way through them. The Nulan'Boar seem to prefer randomness to straight
lines.  Most of the Nulan'Boar are away from the tents, at the moment, but 
there are a few mothers watching their young at play here. The tents are 
all unadorned and look to be large enough for small families. To the south,
is a cleared spot in the camp and you can just see a carving of what looks 
to be a charging boar atop a slender pole. To the west, you can see pasture
or, at least, someplace where animals are kept and cared for.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Middle of the Nulan'Boar camp
    In this part of the camp, the ground is cleared of all obstructions.  The
only feature is a slender pole with a carving of a charging boar adorning
its very top.  The pole is placed in the exact center of the cleared space.
This must be a ceremonial place for the Nulan'Boar, possibly the gathering
place for meals, as well.  It seems as if they take great pains to keep this
place very clear of all things, grass, rocks and animals.

>>    *[NOEXP]* A large cook fire
  As you move into the firelight, it becomes apparent that this is the
source of all the smoke and smells of cooking.  The large fire is surrounded
by men and women turning spits, kneading dough, and cutting meats.  It
appears that all the cooking for the entire camp is done at this one large
fire.  Spits are loaded with roasting haunches of deer and cow.  Several
flat rocks serve as an oven where large, flat pieces of dough become some
sort of bread, and there are even a few glowing kettles positioned very
close to the fire, steaming and bubbling.  From the smells coming from one
of these you guess that the herbs and nuts that some of the women of the
tribe bring in are becoming a stew or soup of some sort.  The fire itself
does not use much wood.  It seems to utilize more readily available fuel
sources, such as dried dung from the herds of animals, and dried grasses. 
There are a few chunks of wood scattered among the other sources of fuel,
but they are not the most important part of the fire's makeup.  From here,
you can travel west into a scattering of tents, or north, deeper into the
camp of the Nulan'Boar.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Path through the scattered tents
  Tents are set up haphazardly through this stretch of grassland.  There is
no clear or visible path through the tents.  It is as if the inhabitants of
the clearing do not care much about structure, at least in terms of where
things are placed.  There are a lot of people moving around here, some armed
with bows and spears, others carry baskets, or blankets and babies.  The low
murmur of their voices is tinged with an exotic accent and you can see a
peacefulness about them.  The tents all seem to be made of bull or deer
skin, and look quite roomy.  While large, the tents are still smaller than
the one to the north and east, which seems to dominate the view within the
camp.  The smells of roasting meat begin to take their toll on you, and you
realize that you are becoming very ravenous.

  Many small plants and reeds grow among the grass here.  The lake to the
north looks clean and pure, and the sounds of frogs and small insects
surround you.  Underfoot, the vegetation is soft and damp.  You can see
several of the Nulan'Boar people going about their business between the
tents to the east, and the smell of roast meat is heavy in the air.  The
clearing looks much like the rest of the grasslands, except for the
gathering of tents, and you are puzzled by this single grove of trees in the
middle of a flat prairie.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Inside a hidden clearing
    The clearing looks even larger now that you are inside the grove of 
ancient trees.  A sparkling lake is a few feet to one side and the stream 
empties into its still waters. You can see many people moving around here, 
some going to and from the lake, either swimming or bringing back pails of 
water to the tents which dot the clearing. The source of the smoke is 
evident, now, as you make note of a large bonfire with several spits of meat 
roasting over it. You can, also, make out a paddock, of sorts, where several 
horses are hobbled.  At the far end of the clearing, a large bull hide tent
stands, as if to watch over the dark-skinned inhabitants as they go about 
their daily lives.

orcs, goblins and kobolds.

  As you enter this part of the castle, a state of disrepair seems to come 
about. Homes and shops look old and crumbled, as indeed one small house has 
fallen apart with age. This is obviously the poorest section in an otherwise 
clean and well-kept castle. To the north looks to be a dingy store of some 
kind and south is a residence.

Spinning in the Storm
  You are spinning hanging onto a long rope that is between the Tempest and a 
Lem-Dagor pirateship. The pirateship has become a litte bigger, as a result 
of your climb. Down - is there a 'down' in a hurricane? - from you, the 
Tempest spins helpless in the whirlwind. Looking further, you see a clearing 
in the storm, becoming bigger and bigger.

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time

meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

A Crack in the Rock
  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.

  Working your way down deeper into the crack, you gain some breathing room

random arrangement of rock?  Or does it include an element of design?  You
note the beautiful moss growing on the walls.

you are not in a cavern or grotto.  Might there be inhabitants here?  It is

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door

A Crack in the Rock
  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.

rock that surrounds you.  Threading your way through pits of quicksand, you
see a trail leading south.

  More skulls crunch beneath your boots.  More emeralds sparkle in the
gloom.  Occasionally a large bat lurches past, its shrill cry piercing the
silence.  It is so dry and barren here, you feel like you are in an
underground desert.  After a bit, the ravine veers east.

  Descending even deeper into this dark realm, you find yourself in a
narrow ravine with high rock walls.  The ground is littered with ugly oblong
skulls.  No armor is to be seen, so perhaps they were a primitive race. 
Despite the bleakness of the ravine, the mineral richness you encounter
continues to dazzle you.  Large green emeralds sparkle in the obsidian-like
rock that surrounds you.  Threading your way through pits of quicksand, you
see a trail leading south.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Behind the velvet drapes (G)
  The lighting in this small sidechamber is rather subdued, the room barely
illuminated by guttering torches on the east and west walls. The marble
floor is clean swept, though scuffed with numerous marks and scratches,
as if the room has been home to a great deal of activity over the years.
The sounds of adventurers snoring and knocking each other off the benches
can be still be heard from the cloak room, though they are somewhat muffled
by the velvet drapes covering the archway to the north. As you become
accustomed to the gloom, you can make out the outline of a man in 
renaissance garb at the far end of the room, watching you wearily.

The central stairwell (G)
  This central location in the tower is brightly lit, though you do not
see any light source. A spiral staircase makes its way up to the landing,
before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through
the halls, much of it going to the shops on the next floor. Shadows flicker
lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the
south.

marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

of issues no one actually cares about any more and the ghosts of inactive
players pop in from time to time to mutter something about all the damn
newbies.  There is a painting of Ivar on the mantle over the fireplace that
all the rocking chairs are crowded around.  In spite of all the chairs here,

  These black mountains seem darker then the ones prior.  There are large

The wind blowing through the treetops sound as if something evil lurks here
hunting for anything living to sustain itself.  Misty trail ways makes it
difficult to know which way to go and could be hiding numerous amounts of
things to make the course more treacherous.  The journey onward must be
proceeded with caution.

Tunnels stretch northwards *inside* of the mountain for as far as you can

a gigantic cavern inside of this mountain!  Many humanoid figures move about
the cavern ahead; it looks as though they are following stone roads
traveling around the sides of the cavern.  Oddly, the tunnels ahead are not
dark, though you see no torches or lanterns burning.

A goblin worker exclaims, "Please don't beat me, master! I will work

A goblin worker cowers in a corner and whimpers softly.
Before the fortress
  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?

Amongst The Killing Fields
  The sun burning high above, makes venturing across the blood tinted
sand almost impossible. With each step your feet sink into the scalding
hot sands of this barren wasteland. In the near distance there is a
traveling wagon train moving from the East to the West. These wagons
do not seem to be carrying wares and goods, like a normal wagon train
should. A closer inspection reveals that each wagon contains a coffin, or
another type of container to hold the deceased. Perhaps these are the
infamous wagons that take the dead to the afterlife.

  The sun burning high above, makes venturing across the blood tinted
sand almost impossible. With each step your feet sink into the scalding
hot sands of this barren wasteland. In the near distance there is a
traveling wagon train moving from the East to the West. These wagons
do not seem to be carrying wares and goods, like a normal wagon train
should. A closer inspection reveals that each wagon contains a coffin, or
another type of container to hold the deceased. Perhaps these are the
infamous wagons that take the dead to the afterlife.

Entering The Ruins Of A Village
  Moving from the caravan of wagons and out of the hot sands, you enter
between the ruins of what was once a town.  Most of the buildings are
crumbled and burnt out, yet due to their size, one can see that this was the
prominent village amongst the realm.  Almost no life can be seen around you
except for the large rat scurrying away with a crumb of what might be food. 
To the south appears to be the town well, and a large building which has
survived the devastation.

Amongst The Killing Fields
  The sun burning high above, makes venturing across the blood tinted
sand almost impossible. With each step your feet sink into the scalding
hot sands of this barren wasteland. In the near distance there is a
traveling wagon train moving from the East to the West. These wagons
do not seem to be carrying wares and goods, like a normal wagon train
should. A closer inspection reveals that each wagon contains a coffin, or
another type of container to hold the deceased. Perhaps these are the
infamous wagons that take the dead to the afterlife.

The Far Western Side Of The Killing Fields
  Moving even deeper within the plains has provided you with ironclad proof
of why they call this place the Killing Fields.  The huge beasts of this
realm hunt for their prey here.  Here on the far west, a unique creature
makes his home.  To the south, the terrain gets a bit steep as the mountains
begin.

>>    *[NOEXP]* The Sands Continue
  Moving away from the caravan takes you deeper into the dreaded sands.
Without the safety of the magical wagons the creatures move a bit
closer to you. Some of the animals here look slightly familiar, yet
deformed all at the same time. What could have possibly happened
to this place?

Amongst The Killing Fields
  The sun burning high above, makes venturing across the blood tinted
sand almost impossible. With each step your feet sink into the scalding
hot sands of this barren wasteland. In the near distance there is a
traveling wagon train moving from the East to the West. These wagons
do not seem to be carrying wares and goods, like a normal wagon train
should. A closer inspection reveals that each wagon contains a coffin, or
another type of container to hold the deceased. Perhaps these are the
infamous wagons that take the dead to the afterlife.

Demon's Halo Mountains
  The mountain range circles around here to cover the northern side of the
range.  Although the going is slow, several well worn grooves along the way
suggest that a people once traveled these mountains on a regular basis.  The
glare from the desert is a stark contrast to the bleary red dust making up
the outer lands of the continent. To the south you can see an encampment of
some kind, just at the beginning of the desert.

  Cold limestone bricks fit perfectly together, and they remain intact here in 
the center of the village. In the middle lies an old well that once supplied 
the village with water. Now the well is locked and closed, stained with the 
plasma of some dead creature. Hanging above the well is an old rusted sign.
Beginning in the east is a dark walkway, to the south is a large building, 
still standing intact.

  Beneath the Forest of Everwood, this is a dark, mossy green enclosure, 
surrounded by the roots of the massive trees towering above. Ahead, down a 
passage bordered by roots and moss, sunlight filters down from above upon 
what appear to be some stony structures in a large opening. The air in here 
seems more still than in the forest above...even as birds fly above you, 
their songs seem somewhat muffled. Above, a grassy fissure leads back to the

thrive in the dim light, and the occasional chirp of a cricket breaks the

Beginning of marble path
  A wide, immaculately laid marble path stretches north from this place toward 
a shining palace. Along the path, beautiful green fields and flower patches 
grow in gardens bordering both the east and west. The occasional child 
scampers across the path to his or her delight, chasing flower petals and 
butterflies on the breeze. The palace itself is a shining white structure 
framed by a large dome and hand-carved statues of singers, musicians, and 
dancers inlaid upon each of its corners and edges. Above this walkway stands 
a 15 foot marble archway, to the exact proportions of the crumbled archway in
the ruins, had it still been intact. And in fact, the palace ahead is to the 
exact proportion of the remaining base stones left standing in the ruins. At 
the center of the tiles on this spot, a plaque bears an inscription.

Garden of Duke Nhoukym
  The garden of Duke Nhoukym is a sparse, green, utilitarian sort of garden.
No flowers or any other 'nonsense' (in his words) are permitted to sprout in 
this section. Instead, the grass is cut at two different lengths to produce a
square pattern which spirals inward to a center stone, upon which a statue of
him is placed. The statue depicts His Grace the Duke Nhoukym on one knee, one
hand holding a bugle aloft, the other upon his chest in a show of fealty to 
the Queen.

  The Lady Maltesa earned her title and this garden when, in the late winter of
the Season of the Storm in the Year of Shadow, she sold all of her chocolates
and placed her children in indentured servitude in order to fund the 
expansion of the Palace's Mezzanine by one seat. The Queen was so touched 
that she would sacrifice her children and chocolates that she bestowed this 
grassy garden as a symbolic fiefdom to the Lady Maltesa, ousting previous 
favourite Lord Aiyeroh. The statue of Lady Maltesa shows a thin woman 
squatting to flog a frog.

  This portion of the gardens imbues a sense of tranquility. Faint music can be
heard from the Palace to the north when a production is underway, and the 
fountain to the north gives a sense of flow and peace. To the west is the 
Garden of Duke Nhoukym, and to the east is the Garden of Lady Maltesa.

Beginning of marble path
  A wide, immaculately laid marble path stretches north from this place toward 
a shining palace. Along the path, beautiful green fields and flower patches 
grow in gardens bordering both the east and west. The occasional child 
scampers across the path to his or her delight, chasing flower petals and 
butterflies on the breeze. The palace itself is a shining white structure 
framed by a large dome and hand-carved statues of singers, musicians, and 
dancers inlaid upon each of its corners and edges. Above this walkway stands 
a 15 foot marble archway, to the exact proportions of the crumbled archway in
the ruins, had it still been intact. And in fact, the palace ahead is to the 
exact proportion of the remaining base stones left standing in the ruins. At 
the center of the tiles on this spot, a plaque bears an inscription.

Nearing the palace
  This northern part of the garden, dedicated to the Royal Children, is more 
grandiose in nature than the southern section which was dedicated to the 
Nobles. The marble is a little brighter here, and the gardens on either side 
of the path exude a colourful vibrance not seen in the green gardens to the 
south. The grandeur and opulence of the palace to the north is nearly 
overwhelming. To the west is the Garden of Princess Amepsmamptra, and to the 
east is the Garden of Prince Amepsmamptrer.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

  Standing knee-deep in the murkish water, you feel the curious sensation
of unseen creatures slithering against you.  The soft ripples trailing
across the water are rythmically entrancing, but you blink back to reality
when you see the reptilian creature which forms the ripples.  With a shiver,
you move on, wanting to be out of the mist-laden swamp.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more

antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.

     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew

Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

  The cathedral continues on here, still as stunning and brilliant as it
was in the entryway.  A cyan statue of a yak stands to your west.  Yaks, of
course, are such noble and demure creatures that you can't help but wipe
away a tear - the statue is just so gorgeous.  Even though the floor is made
of the same jewel as the walls, your boots don't make any noise at all -
it's as if someone wanted to preserve the tranquility of the cathedral. 
That's completely fine with you, as you've felt more at peace here than
anywhere else.  The cathedral's altar lies to the west, the entry way is to
the east, and nuns' quarters lie to the north and south.

jumping in and out of the water, passing the time by playing together.  You
smile to yourself at how pleasant the scene is and resolve to spend more
time just sitting by a lake and letting things be.  Inside the chamber you
see two very neat beds, each with a small plaque on the headboard.  A
communal dresser against the east wall houses the nuns' habits, and you
notice that the outfits are impeccable.  The two inhabitants must truly set
an example for the other nuns.

  The brilliant building before you is made entirely of cyan colored
crystal which you quickly recognize as being aquamarine.  A holy energy
seems to radiate from the building, filling your soul with warmth and
goodness.  The crystalline house of worship has a tear-jerking scene painted
on it: a sargasso miner discovers this strange town and proceeds to forget
all the evil in his heart.  How touching!  This place, unlike some of the
more corrupt churches you've visited, fills you with such a sense of
serenity that you know that all doubts will be removed when you enter its
walls.

Inside a strange city
  Closing your eyes, you jump down the hole.  After speeding towards the
ground at terminal velocity for several minutes, you suddenly screech to a
near halt and find yourself floating very gently and gracefully downwards. 
For some reason this reminds you of "Alice in Wonderland" when Alice jumps
down the rabbit's hole.  After almost an hour of floating like a feather,
you see sky below you.  SKY?!  You could have SWORN that you were just in a
cave.  Yet here you are, falling down towards a sky and a sparkling city
below.  The sun gleams off all the buildings, spiralling reds, blues,
purples, and colors you don't even have names for in all directions.  As you
touch ground for the first time in ages, you find yourself in the midst of
this strange underground city of sky and crystal.

  You tiptoe through the door into the aquamarine cathedral and are struck
with reverence for the strange inhabitants of this bejeweled city.  The
architecture of this building is just incredible, combining the columns of
the classical style and the flamboyancy of the baroque with the twinkling
brilliance of aquamarine gems.  Diamond sculptures of exquisite craftsmanship
grace the hallway with tranquility.  The smell of fresh lilacs floats
throughout the air, sending you into a dream-like trance.  You never want to
leave this place of beauty and life, as you feel at one with yourself here. 
You notice some aquamarine doors to the south and north, while the lovely
cathedral continues to the west.

  The cathedral continues on here, still as stunning and brilliant as it
was in the entryway.  A cyan statue of a yak stands to your west.  Yaks, of
course, are such noble and demure creatures that you can't help but wipe
away a tear - the statue is just so gorgeous.  Even though the floor is made
of the same jewel as the walls, your boots don't make any noise at all -
it's as if someone wanted to preserve the tranquility of the cathedral. 
That's completely fine with you, as you've felt more at peace here than
anywhere else.  The cathedral's altar lies to the west, the entry way is to
the east, and nuns' quarters lie to the north and south.

  Talcum Way (which is covered with Talcum powder, believe it or not)
extends north here.  Your boots don't make the "crunch, crunch" sound that
you expect, but rather you hear a pleasant swishing sound, similar to a
broom of feathers brushing across a tile floor.  You close your eyes and let
the peaceful sounds overcome you.  You feel lighter than air, almost as if
you could float away into the clouds.  Two very decorative mansions lie to
your east and west: one made of jade, the other of opal.  To your north is a
very ancient library.

  Bookshelves spiral upwards towards the seemingly endless ceiling.  Normal
citizens and scholars alike congregate here to do but one thing: learn.  To
this end, sapphire tables are scattered about the library, and each is
completely crammed with people reading, examining, and poring over the
contents of some book or other.  Seeing how engrossed people are in their
reading, you mosey over to one of the bookshelves.  Three particular works
catch your eye: "Planets and You", "The Life and Times of Queen Angelina",
and "Melosa's Wish".  How fascinating!

  This section of the library contains some very rare books: consequently,
there are some extremely knowledge-thirsty creatures studying here.  You
tiptoe very cautiously, because just the slightest noise would bring their
complete wrath upon you.  Sure, they may be just scholars, but enraged
scholars can be a big pain in the butt.  A large bookshelf to your west
contains quite a few interesting looking books, while one to the left looks
quite boring.  Not all information is worth knowing, you suppose.

being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Boot Clan Public Hall (G)
  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

>>    Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance. 

Type 'North' to begin your journey...

land?  Maybe if you step carefully, VERY carefully, the ice won't break.  
There's no sight of the shore anywhere, looks like this ice will break any
minute. Perhaps you'd best find a way off it.

The Jungle Trail
  Going down this trail seems easy.  The sun's shining down, warming up
everything and birds are chirping in the trees.  You better hope that no
dangerous creatures are out there lurking around.  With all the rustling in
the bushes, there might be a bear coming, if they have those sort of
creatures.  If talking trees are all you have to deal with, this journey
might just be a pleasant one.

Worms and puddles
  The dirt under the hedges is a little churned up and muddy. There is a group 
of worms oozing in and out of the mud under the safety of the leaves. The 
grass nearby is squishy and little puddles of water form momentarily in the 
footprints left behind. A trio of black and orange butterflies dance along 
the dark hedges, sparkling in the sunlight.

  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

  Definitely not much to look at, this one-room shack is nonetheless
typical of the dwellings squabbled over in the Warren.  With a roof so low
one has to duck to enter, and only some ragged blankets to provide comfort,
it does have one precious advantage- it's a place to hide from those that
would do its occupant harm.  And there are many, many of those.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

Courtyard of the Stone Palace
  The epitome of the perfect military installation, the courtyard almost
hums with the activity of soldiers and their support staff.  Demons march in
drills, perfectly in step.  A chow line is set up at the far end, and the
serving Damned ladling out greasy stew each bear the mark of Nephelus on his
or her forehead.  There is no idle chatter here, though the shouts of
officers and sergeants ring through the yard, trying to be heard over each
other.

A crack in the valley floor
  The valley you travel through is marred by an opening caused by a
recent earthquake.  The sun casts trails of light that reach deep in
the opening illuminating what appears to be mason work.  Looking in,
you can see that the sides of the crevasse form a rough staircase 
leading into the gloom.

The crevasse
  Climbing down the crevasse you are plagued by aftershocks that cause you
to lose your grip.  With each move you set loose rocks tumbling down letting
you know how far you would fall.  Your light begins to illuminate what seems

A great hall
  As you pass through a painted ceiling you emerge into a great hall.  
The tiles on the floor seem to make a pattern of some sort but the 
dust makes it hard to see.  Large Ionic pillars line the east and 
west walls of this room.  The southern wall is buried under dirt and 
rocks.  You see a faint light coming from an alcove to the north.  It 
adds an eerie glow to the room.

An alcove
  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its
walls are lined by smaller pillars that you saw in the hall.  In the center
there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.  

[ Exits: south ]
(White Aura) A cracked statue is placed here giving off an eerie glow.
A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

The lightside of the coin
  Staring out across the edge of the citadel you can see the land of
Aardwolf whisking by.  You can hear the joy and feel the warmth from within
the small town that lies to the north.  Looking up into the clouds, past the
city, you see the goal of this journey.  Somewhere in that tower lies the
relic you seek.

A back alley
  The way you came is now gone and you find yourself in a back alley.  The
alley walls are high and too flat to get any traction to climb.  The ground
has garbage on it; luckily not much light gets back here so it is not
rotten.  Noises come to you from the opening leading from the alley into the
main part of town.

 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."

gain a good foothold.  A spiraling staircase leads farther up the tower.

however, is a small coin with one side in the light and one in darkness.  Of
the artifact you are looking for there is no trace.  Where could it be?

Born into Arms (G)
  
A great stone fortress towers over the rolling countryside, surrounded by what
seems to be an unscalable wall ringing its perimeter. Verdant flags flying
from the towers and draped from the ramparts declare this bastion of might to
be the Emerald Stronghold. The only entrance to this place is barred with a
weathered, yet stalwart, gate that has stood for ages.
 
On either side of the gates, mounting huge, monolithic pillars are two colossal
statues facing one another with swords crossed above the entrance. These
imposing figures engraved in marble are in the likeness of the goddess Athena
and the legendary guardian of Midgaard, Hassan. Here they stand, ever vigilant
against the darkness they united against. At the base of each pillar, a plaque
details the momentous event of their accord.

  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that

marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

In the Back of the Aylorian Temple (G)
  Standing in the back of the Temple of Aylor, one can truly appreciate
its unique structure and design.  The white marble walls and floor blend
together, accented by black pews, altar, and pulpit.  The blood-red candles
around the room seem calming but almost foreboding.  The windows, accented
in gold, are brightly painted to portray handsome yet intimidating scenes.
A large, white and gold statue of a man monuments the front of the room. 
The statue stands taller than 20 feet in the temple's vaulted ceiling.

The temple's altar stands to the north, with the exit into Aylor to the south. 
A small black doorway stands in the distance to the west.

difficult to know which way to go and could be hiding numerous amounts of
things to make the course more treacherous.  The journey onward must be

  Several larger goblins lounge around this room sleeping and playing
bones.  It's obvious they are continuously arguing over who's going to go
stand out in the tunnel and watch for intruders as they throw another hand
of bones.  It's also equally obvious to you that none of them are going to
actually go do it either.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Minor surgeries

surgery they are having. There's a door to the east which is not labeled, and

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

floor is clean swept, though scuffed with numerous marks and scratches,
as if the room has been home to a great deal of activity over the years.
The sounds of adventurers snoring and knocking each other off the benches
can be still be heard from the cloak room, though they are somewhat muffled
by the velvet drapes covering the archway to the north. As you become
accustomed to the gloom, you can make out the outline of a man in 
renaissance garb at the far end of the room, watching you wearily.

  This central location in the tower is brightly lit, though you do not
see any light source. A spiral staircase makes its way up to the landing,
before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through
the halls, much of it going to the shops on the next floor. Shadows flicker
lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the
south.

  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.

Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

rocks in the way that proceeding farther in that direction would be
impossible.  The wind picks up again and you choke and gag as you inhale

A Dingy Saloon
  The walls and ceiling of this saloon are made of a sturdy canvas-like 
material held aloft by a wooden framework that gives the large tent its 
shape. The dirt floor is covered with sawdust, and it looks like left-over 
food and other things have been tossed down there also. The tables and chairs
are made of a crudely cut dark wood that gives the saloon a utilitarian 
feeling. Along the west wall is a bar made of the same wood as the chairs and
tables, but the surface has been smoothed and polished. Behind the bar are 
shelves with bottles of various alcoholic liquids, and a keg of beer sits on 
the floor underneath the shelves. Small stacks of semi-clean shot glasses are
at both ends of the bar, and cheap pewter mugs for the beer sit on a shelf 
above the keg. The only illumination is provided by dirty hanging oil 
lanterns that swing lazily from the breeze that blows in from the opening.

not a good idea to randomly enter mirrors hoping that they are portals.  At

  Pictures of all the kings and queens of this recently discovered kingdom
line the crystalline walls in this section of the hallway.  From the gilded
plates beneath each, you are able to trace the lineage of the monarchs from
Queen Angelina, the present ruler, back 12 generations to Queen Rosita and
King James.  What amazes you most of all about these paintings is that each
of the leaders has a genuine smile on his or her face - in many portraits
the subject smiles almost cynically, but you see none of that in the faces
of the monarchs.  On the western wall is a silver plaque listing the members
of the current royal family as well as their birthdates.  The sense of
history and pride in one's family that the royalty displays is incredible
and quite refreshing: too many people forget who they are and pay attention
instead to where they are going.  The hallway continues east and west.

  Two tapestries woven of pure silken threads grace the diamond walls of
the hallway, each depicting a turning point of not just the castle, but of
the whole city as well.  Crystalline suits of armor line the walls,
absorbing the light then dispersing it in a prismatic spiral.  The
chandelier hanging from the ceiling has no candles with which to
illuminate the corridor, yet it gives off a tranquil radiance which urges
you to release all your pent up hatreds and phobias.  Your eyelids slowly
drift downwards as you fall into a deep healing trance.  Here, above all

  The diamond walls of the corridor open up into a huge ante chamber here,
and you gaze up at the almost endless ceiling.  Tiny points of light dot the
top of the large dome in the ceiling, and you get the sensation that the
energy of the stars themselves are being funneled into the castle.  Indeed,
you feel like some kind of cosmic force is protecting you from harm.  Unlike
the light of the stars, however, the light is somewhat chilly, almost as if
it has been corrupted.  The sensation increases as you head north, towards
the jail, but decreases as you go south towards the portal room.  The throne
room is far ahead of you, a long way to the east.

  Pictures of all the kings and queens of this recently discovered kingdom
line the crystalline walls in this section of the hallway.  From the gilded
plates beneath each, you are able to trace the lineage of the monarchs from
Queen Angelina, the present ruler, back 12 generations to Queen Rosita and
King James.  What amazes you most of all about these paintings is that each
of the leaders has a genuine smile on his or her face - in many portraits
the subject smiles almost cynically, but you see none of that in the faces
of the monarchs.  On the western wall is a silver plaque listing the members
of the current royal family as well as their birthdates.  The sense of
history and pride in one's family that the royalty displays is incredible
and quite refreshing: too many people forget who they are and pay attention
instead to where they are going.  The hallway continues east and west.

  You have greatly enjoyed your journey through Sargasso, the underworld,
and this mysterious town/castle, but now all that is behind you.  You stand
in front of the diamond door to the throne room, where you can at last meet
Queen Angelina, whose grace and wisdom you have heard much about.  Your heart
starts to race with excitement, and you want to tear down the door just so
you can see her more quickly.  You will yourself to calm down however, and
take time out to think of what you will say to her.  As you ponder this
important question, you admire the statues of the queen that guard the
throne room like angels of eternity.  They were sculpted from pure diamond,
but their eyes are aquamarine, their staves sapphires, their halos topaz, and
their fingernails rubies.  Its almost as if Queen Angelina summoned the
powers from all corners of her realm to protect her throne room from hatred
and destruction.  Taking a deep breath, you finally realize what you will
say to her and decide to open the door.

fists and choking the very life out of all those inside ...  Including you. 
Your very soul feels like it is being ripped in half.  It is like death
itself threw its well aimed dart and pinned you to the wall like a butterfly
with no will whose sentence has always been written.  You start to gag
uncontrollably and summon all your will to purge your body of the spirit. 
With a loud groan you regain control of your body, and force the spirit away
into the eastern wall.  That was a hellish experience that does NOT need

  The diamond walls of the corridor open up into a huge ante chamber here,
and you gaze up at the almost endless ceiling.  Tiny points of light dot the
top of the large dome in the ceiling, and you get the sensation that the
energy of the stars themselves are being funneled into the castle.  Indeed,
you feel like some kind of cosmic force is protecting you from harm.  Unlike
the light of the stars, however, the light is somewhat chilly, almost as if
it has been corrupted.  The sensation increases as you head north, towards
the jail, but decreases as you go south towards the portal room.  The throne
room is far ahead of you, a long way to the east.

  As you walk along this talcum-covered path, you see what appears to be a
large castle made entirely of glass in the distance.  Smiling to yourself,
you are almost blinded by the sunlight reflecting into your eyes.  You
shield your face with your hand, hoping that you can block out the radiance.
The light is so pure that it hurts even a powerful adventurer such as you.

ordinary glass: it is pure diamond.  You whistle at the exorbitant cost, but

Approaching the portal room
  You feel a strange static force pulsating in the air here, almost as if
bands of energy are gathering.  Your hair stands on end as you move farther
south, not because you are afraid, but rather because of all the static. 
You become quite tense as you realize that something must be creating the
tremendous force, and you are not quite sure what the source is nor how to
stop it.  Even the magic of the diamond walls seems overpowered by this
unseen force.  The portal room is to the south, while the hallway lies to
your north.

  The diamond walls of the corridor open up into a huge ante chamber here,
and you gaze up at the almost endless ceiling.  Tiny points of light dot the
top of the large dome in the ceiling, and you get the sensation that the
energy of the stars themselves are being funneled into the castle.  Indeed,
you feel like some kind of cosmic force is protecting you from harm.  Unlike
the light of the stars, however, the light is somewhat chilly, almost as if
it has been corrupted.  The sensation increases as you head north, towards
the jail, but decreases as you go south towards the portal room.  The throne
room is far ahead of you, a long way to the east.

Inside Diamond Castle
  Pictures of all the kings and queens of this recently discovered kingdom
line the crystalline walls in this section of the hallway.  From the gilded
plates beneath each, you are able to trace the lineage of the monarchs from
Queen Angelina, the present ruler, back 12 generations to Queen Rosita and
King James.  What amazes you most of all about these paintings is that each
of the leaders has a genuine smile on his or her face - in many portraits
the subject smiles almost cynically, but you see none of that in the faces
of the monarchs.  On the western wall is a silver plaque listing the members
of the current royal family as well as their birthdates.  The sense of
history and pride in one's family that the royalty displays is incredible
and quite refreshing: too many people forget who they are and pay attention
instead to where they are going.  The hallway continues east and west.

  You have greatly enjoyed your journey through Sargasso, the underworld,
and this mysterious town/castle, but now all that is behind you.  You stand
in front of the diamond door to the throne room, where you can at last meet
Queen Angelina, whose grace and wisdom you have heard much about.  Your heart
starts to race with excitement, and you want to tear down the door just so
you can see her more quickly.  You will yourself to calm down however, and
take time out to think of what you will say to her.  As you ponder this
important question, you admire the statues of the queen that guard the
throne room like angels of eternity.  They were sculpted from pure diamond,
but their eyes are aquamarine, their staves sapphires, their halos topaz, and
their fingernails rubies.  Its almost as if Queen Angelina summoned the
powers from all corners of her realm to protect her throne room from hatred
and destruction.  Taking a deep breath, you finally realize what you will
say to her and decide to open the door.

  As you enter Queen Angelina's throne room, you (rightfully) expect the
room to be filled with diamonds, as the rest of the castle is.  Much to your
surprise, there are no jewels of any kind to be found.  The throne room is
filled with puffy white clouds that you could bounce on for days and days
and the novelty would not wear off.  Indeed, the atmosphere is that of a
bright blue sky, and you cannot tell where the room begins and ends, so
seamless is the illusion.  A soft breeze blows throughout the chamber,
gently tossing your hair about.  Only two objects are in this room: Queen
Angelina's cherry wood throne and a magical decanter which produces a crisp,
spring-like scent.  You sigh and close your eyes, letting the Queen's
essence fill your soul.  It is warm and loving, and you now know why she is
so adored by her people.

absorbing the light then dispersing it in a prismatic spiral.  The
chandelier hanging from the ceiling has no candles with which to
illuminate the corridor, yet it gives off a tranquil radiance which urges
you to release all your pent up hatreds and phobias.  Your eyelids slowly

as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which

Inside a strange city
  Closing your eyes, you jump down the hole.  After speeding towards the
ground at terminal velocity for several minutes, you suddenly screech to a
near halt and find yourself floating very gently and gracefully downwards. 
For some reason this reminds you of "Alice in Wonderland" when Alice jumps
down the rabbit's hole.  After almost an hour of floating like a feather,
you see sky below you.  SKY?!  You could have SWORN that you were just in a
cave.  Yet here you are, falling down towards a sky and a sparkling city
below.  The sun gleams off all the buildings, spiralling reds, blues,
purples, and colors you don't even have names for in all directions.  As you
touch ground for the first time in ages, you find yourself in the midst of
this strange underground city of sky and crystal.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  The leaves on the hedges wave around a little in the light wind that also 
brings the perfume of numerous flowers with it, tickling the hairs of your 
nose slightly. A stray autumn leaf drifts past you, slowly floating backwards
and forwards as it gets closer and closer to the green grass, to lay there 
unmoving. A grasshopper, startled by the leaf's appearance, springs away in a
graceful bound.

in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

You wake up on Medical beds, then stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance. 

Type 'North' to begin your journey...

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Boot Clan Public Hall (G)
  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
(Hidden) You catch a glimpse of a jackrabbit out of the corner of your eye.
Slithering through the grasslands a cottonmouth searches for prey.
(Hidden) (Golden Aura) A Nulan'Boar woman walks through the grasslands, gathering roots and herbs.
Pale cream in color, a moth feeds on the flowers of the plains.

tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

Before the Captain's Quarters
  You are about to meet Rory Prosper, captain of the storm ship, Tempest.
Without a doubt, the man behind the door must be among the best of the best.
Brave, intelligent and calm before the storm - these are the qualities of a 
storm ship captain.

The West Side of the Bridge
  There are some storm ships in which it is very dark, or where you can see 
white clouds appearing everywhere. The Tempest is surely not one of them.
Every room is brightly lit, the floors swabbed and the brass railings buffed.
Everything is so fine and tidy, it is hard to believe it's a ship that 
traverses the ocean on a storm's leading edge.

The Imaginarium
  You have entered a room, which is completely white on all walls. On the north
wall is a PLAQUE. Two strange creatures stand before a crystal of some sort.
They appear to be communicating with each other with a high porpoise-like 
sound.

  This part of the hallway is damaged very badly. It seems like a total war is 
going on in the ship. West is the entryway and east the Imaginarium. North is

towards battle and some, fearfully away from battle.

The Eye of the Storm (G)
  You have entered the nothingness of the eye of a hurricane, a dangerous place
to be, and certainly a false haven. There is a rope leading from the Tempest 
to a far point above you. With some effort you can follow the rope with your 
eyes. You hold onto the rope and climb when you discover a Lem-Dagor 
pirateship!

  You are spinning hanging onto a long rope that is between the Tempest and a 
Lem-Dagor pirateship. The pirateship has become a litte bigger, as a result 
of your climb. Down - is there a 'down' in a hurricane? - from you, the 
Tempest spins helpless in the whirlwind. Looking further, you see a clearing 
in the storm, becoming bigger and bigger.

the Tempest has disappeared into the misty storm.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

The central stairwell (G)
  This central location in the tower is brightly lit, though you do not
see any light source. A spiral staircase makes its way up to the landing,
before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through
the halls, much of it going to the shops on the next floor. Shadows flicker
lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the

The Theatre (G)
  Ghosts of ancient plays echo through this room, a thespian spirit haunting
the stage.  Heavy velvet draperies line the walls to help control the
echoing voices of the actors as they perform.  Stairs lead high up into
the balcony, and, as you wonder how anyone can see the stage from there,
you're grateful that your seats are on the lower level. 
The usher leads you to your seat and hands you a program; you glance
through it, and notice that page1 and page2 are full of useful theatre
etiquette. As you read, a hush fills the room, save for the quiet sounds
of rustling backstage; it seems that the performance is about to begin.

Peto's Cornucopia O' Corn (G)
  You look in wonder at the many bright colors in this room.  Even for
Bards there are many.  You see a large man serving customers ahead of you in
the line, each of whom walk away sniffing some unusual and obviously foreign
delicacy.  The only delicacy you can even guess at seems to be a little
carton full of what looks like cheese.  Moving ahead, you can see more of
the back of the stand, in which lies two barrels, which are constantly
making noise which can even be heard over the chatter of the customers.  You
look into the cup of a passing, just-served customer and see that the liquid
is cherry-colored.  The liquid is bubbly and noisy.  In a far corner of the
stand, you see some rocks hopping up and down all by themselves!  In the
other far corner, you see a metal vat, the contents of which are out of your
sight, but you guess is the same as that which lies about it, a
yellow-orange pudding!  As the customer in front of you moves away, you
realize you are next.

The Cloak Room (G)
  At the center of this cloak room is a large, circular coat rack, which is
filled with all manner of outerwear.  Fine fur coats and tailored jackets
hang side by side with travel-stained cloaks and scuffed, crudely tanned
leather overcoats.  Through a gap in the cloaks you see a light flickering.
A closer look reveals a small fire surrounded by a pair of comfortable-
looking benches.  At the foot of a velvet-topped bench is a small fountain,
which bubbles forth fresh orange juice.  Along the walls of the room lie
a multitude of packs, both bulging and empty, some of which lie in the way
of the exits to the northward concession stand and the stairwell to the
west.  However, there are no packs along the southern wall, which is hung
with large, velvet drapes that discreetly cloak another exit to a small
chamber.

Lem-Dagor pirateship. The pirateship has become a litte bigger, as a result 
of your climb. Down - is there a 'down' in a hurricane? - from you, the 
Tempest spins helpless in the whirlwind. Looking further, you see a clearing 
in the storm, becoming bigger and bigger.

never seem to reach their goal.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Path to the fortress
  Moving cautiously through the tunnels, you soon find the source of the
light.  Several puny-looking goblins cower along the walls as you enter the
room, as though they expect to be kicked at any time.  You notice they are
holding some strange slug-like creatures that are giving off a luminary
glow.  Seeing your curiosity, a goblin stands up and places a slug on the
wall of the tunnel.  It promptly sticks in place and its glow brightens just
a bit, making your vision all the better.  Apparently this kind of light
does not hurt the goblin's eyes as does the sunlight.  From the east you
hear a snarl, and the puny goblins scramble to their feet and quickly begin
applying more slugs.

Before the fortress
  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?

Hallway in the fortress
  As you enter a hallway in the fortress, you're still amazed that such a
fortress could remain hidden here in the mountain from the people of
Aylor for so long.  Everyone always wondered how the mountain goblins of
the Miden'nir seemed to be endless.  No matter how many were killed there
were always more.  Guess this leaves no doubt as to where they all come
from.

difficult to know which way to go and could be hiding numerous amounts of
things to make the course more treacherous.  The journey onward must be

a gigantic cavern inside of this mountain!  Many humanoid figures move about
the cavern ahead; it looks as though they are following stone roads
traveling around the sides of the cavern.  Oddly, the tunnels ahead are not
dark, though you see no torches or lanterns burning.

Path to the fortress
  Moving cautiously through the tunnels, you soon find the source of the
light.  Several puny-looking goblins cower along the walls as you enter the
room, as though they expect to be kicked at any time.  You notice they are
holding some strange slug-like creatures that are giving off a luminary
glow.  Seeing your curiosity, a goblin stands up and places a slug on the
wall of the tunnel.  It promptly sticks in place and its glow brightens just
a bit, making your vision all the better.  Apparently this kind of light
does not hurt the goblin's eyes as does the sunlight.  From the east you
hear a snarl, and the puny goblins scramble to their feet and quickly begin
applying more slugs.

everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?

Carved from the stone of the mountain itself, this place is built to last. 
An army wouldn't have a chance of defeating the goblins here at this
fortress, but maybe if you can find out what's going on around here you can
upset them enough to cause problems internally.

were always more.  Guess this leaves no doubt as to where they all come
from.

Hallway in the fortress
  Noticing the doors north and south of you, you wonder if these could be
the guards' barracks.  It's strange that a fortress of this size, with so
many guards wandering about, does not seem to have any barracks to rest in. 
It's doubtful these will be those either though; they are far too quiet and
everyone knows goblins snore like a storm.

Fortress intersection [**> PK <**]
  Standing in an intersection in the fortress, you're unsure which way to
go.  Looking around you feel something grabbing onto your foot and you
glance down.  A clawed hand is reaching up through a grate in the floor.  A
low hiss rises up to your ears and you yank your foot back to the sound of
snarls and cursing.  Whatever way you decide to go it's obvious that down is
not one of the choices.

Hallway in the fortress
  As you enter a hallway in the fortress, you're still amazed that such a
fortress could remain hidden here in the mountain from the people of
Aylor for so long.  Everyone always wondered how the mountain goblins of
the Miden'nir seemed to be endless.  No matter how many were killed there
were always more.  Guess this leaves no doubt as to where they all come
from.

Just inside the fortress [**> PK <**]
  Stepping through the doors into the fortress, you aren't bothered by the
guards at all.  You release your grip on your weapon, having expected them
to at least question you about your intentions here or who you might be. 
Carved from the stone of the mountain itself, this place is built to last. 
An army wouldn't have a chance of defeating the goblins here at this
fortress, but maybe if you can find out what's going on around here you can
upset them enough to cause problems internally.

Tunnels stretch northwards *inside* of the mountain for as far as you can
see.  In the distance you see what looks to be a smaller mountain inside of
a gigantic cavern inside of this mountain!  Many humanoid figures move about
the cavern ahead; it looks as though they are following stone roads
traveling around the sides of the cavern.  Oddly, the tunnels ahead are not
dark, though you see no torches or lanterns burning.

Path to the fortress
  Moving cautiously through the tunnels, you soon find the source of the
light.  Several puny-looking goblins cower along the walls as you enter the
room, as though they expect to be kicked at any time.  You notice they are
holding some strange slug-like creatures that are giving off a luminary
glow.  Seeing your curiosity, a goblin stands up and places a slug on the
wall of the tunnel.  It promptly sticks in place and its glow brightens just
a bit, making your vision all the better.  Apparently this kind of light
does not hurt the goblin's eyes as does the sunlight.  From the east you
hear a snarl, and the puny goblins scramble to their feet and quickly begin
applying more slugs.  

[ Exits: north east south ]
(Red Aura) A tiny goblin runs quickly around here belching fire.
A sticky slug covered in slimy goo sticks to the wall and glows brightly.

>>    Before the fortress
  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?  

[ Exits: north east south west ]

  Stepping through the doors into the fortress, you aren't bothered by the
guards at all.  You release your grip on your weapon, having expected them
to at least question you about your intentions here or who you might be. 
Carved from the stone of the mountain itself, this place is built to last. 
An army wouldn't have a chance of defeating the goblins here at this
fortress, but maybe if you can find out what's going on around here you can
upset them enough to cause problems internally.

Hallway in the fortress
  As you enter a hallway in the fortress, you're still amazed that such a
fortress could remain hidden here in the mountain from the people of
Aylor for so long.  Everyone always wondered how the mountain goblins of
the Miden'nir seemed to be endless.  No matter how many were killed there
were always more.  Guess this leaves no doubt as to where they all come
from.  

[ Exits: north south ]

Fortress intersection [**> PK <**]
  Standing in an intersection in the fortress, you're unsure which way to
go.  Looking around you feel something grabbing onto your foot and you
glance down.  A clawed hand is reaching up through a grate in the floor.  A
low hiss rises up to your ears and you yank your foot back to the sound of
snarls and cursing.  Whatever way you decide to go it's obvious that down is
not one of the choices.
 
A small sign is bolted to the nearby wall. Better read it.

laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more

mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

  You step through the archway leading into the academy courtyard, stopping to 
take in the splendor around you. You notice an older gentleman leaning 
against the wall. He steps from his post and approaches you with an easy and

an example application.

All applications should be on Personal Board and addressed to Boot. For
the Subject, please reference the words "application" or "joining". Now just
like a job application, you wouldn't just put "I want the job!". We'd like a
bit more information as the following example shows:

Current forum changed to Personal. You can read and write in this forum.

Enter your post. Type END on an empty line to finish.

Hello, my name is Barney.
I have been playing for 15 years and I really enjoy doing quests and
campaigns. :)
I would like to join bootcamp because I would like some extra help
learning where to level.
I'm pretty active, I really enjoy the game and hope to make some new
friends. :D

The above is an example of a good application. Here is an example of a bad one:
"i would like to join boot camp, it is awsome"

Not much information at all is given there and it doesn't look as though
a lot of effort was put into writing it. This doesn't give your potential
future clannies a lot of incentive to get to know you better. Most clans
would prefer something along the lines of the first note for an application
(or in many cases, quite a bit more than that). We here at Boot Camp are not
as strict, but we do want to help you learn to write application notes now so
that you know the basics for clan applications as you continue your
Aard career.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

In the Back of the Aylorian Temple (G)
  Standing in the back of the Temple of Aylor, one can truly appreciate
its unique structure and design.  The white marble walls and floor blend
together, accented by black pews, altar, and pulpit.  The blood-red candles
around the room seem calming but almost foreboding.  The windows, accented
in gold, are brightly painted to portray handsome yet intimidating scenes.
A large, white and gold statue of a man monuments the front of the room. 
The statue stands taller than 20 feet in the temple's vaulted ceiling.

The temple's altar stands to the north, with the exit into Aylor to the south. 
A small black doorway stands in the distance to the west.

An Intersection in the Temple (G)
  You are walking up the center aisle between rows of pews.  Travelling
farther north takes you up to the pulpit, the raised platform from which the
divine leaders give their sermons.  The lectern holds a large book, which
appears to have a black leather cover.  Heading east or west at this point
takes you into the black marble pews.  The temple's exit is south.

  The fields here have been laid waste by some massive battle (or a very
large field mouse).  A few pathetic, straggling shreds of grass rise up from
the ground here and there, but the ground is covered with the footprints of
great armies.  Apparently, they were armies of ...  Furniture?  To the north
a long road wends through the fields.  To the southeast, two large towers
stretch upwards.

desperately to avoid the oncoming rush of animals as they scurry and run to
and from the tower.  Looking upwards, you see that the tower rises up at
least fifty feet into the air.  Once, this tower must have been beautiful,
majestic.  Now, however, it is only an eyesore in ruins.

  Finally you have made it to Richard's tower.  You were worried traveling
through the battlefield with so much fighting raging on around you, but
neither the animals nor the enchanted goods seemed interested in you. 
Stepping just inside of the tower, you can see that this tower used to
actually be part of a castle.  Now, however, it is only shambled remains of
its former glory.  The floors and walls are covered in animal feces and
cracks run the length of the room, worrying you that at any time this whole
place may come down on top of you.

verge of collapse after so many months of constant battle.  You notice some
stairs here that seem to go both up and down, as well as collapsing hallways
leading off in all directions.  Unsure of which way to go, you place your

covers this place, along with droppings of every other kind of animal that

  Obviously Richard is very serious about defeating his brother; this room
is apparently a makeshift jail.  It is filled with tables, chairs, and other
household goods that have not been animated by Virgil yet.  In his own way
Richard is denying Virgil access to more troops and although quite silly,
you can not deny that this is, in a sense, a real jail.

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a

Welcome to Grandmarket Boulevard! (G)
  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

gather to find the treasures of Grandmarket Boulevard.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Road Not Taken
  Turning away from the busy street, you walk down a little-used alley and come
to a part of the city that doesn't seem to get a lot of traffic. You marvel at
the sights and sounds as you make your way between the houses and shops. 
Somehow, this area seems even more beautiful than the rest of Aylor. The 
buildings look old, yet you don't remember ever seeing them before. Can there
really be an entire city quarter you just never noticed before?
You make your way through a pair of city gates and out into the countryside.
Breaking away from the main road is a path following along the city wall.
Off in the distance you see a large tower made of three intertwined pillars.
It piques your attention, so you follow the path toward the tower. Eventually,
you come to a road. Though it seems neglected, there is something hauntingly
familiar about it, as if you've seen it in another world. The Granite Highway.

The Granite Highway
  Traveling along the Granite Highway, you notice a striking marble
staircase leading upwards.  Peering along the glorious blue and white 
marble, you can discern a helixed tower rising above you.  Deciding 
that the scenic route would, perhaps, be better than simply walking 
along the same, tired highway, you veer off the stone road and take 
the path towards the brilliant staircase. Wonders past the imagining 
of mortal beings must reside there, and your head fills with images 
of marble staircases, each landing revealing a new landscape or marvel.
The graceful flight of several white doves draws arcs of tranquility 
along the reddish-orange background of the majestic setting sun.  A 
northerly breeze ruffles your hair and makes the deep green grass sway 
back and forth like the gentle crests and troughs of the Dragon Sea.  
You decide to remove your boots so that your worn feet can bathe in 
the essence of placidity that surrounds you.  Thoughts of a utopian 
society enter your tired head, and you slowly drift off to sleep, 
dreaming of a land where all walk hand in hand towards a brighter future.

The Alembic and Pentameter
  This room is dominated by a long counter along one side.  The counter
is made of the same rainbowed marble found elsewhere in the tower,
and appears seamless.  Behind the counter, long rows of shelves line
the walls.  The shelves are packed with bottles, glittering with deeply
jewel-toned potions.  At one end of the counter, a small alembic lies
in a deep wall embrasure.  Written around the arched embrasure are the
processes of alchemy...Calcination, Digestion, Fermentation, Congelation, 
Fixation, Ceration, Distillation, Sublimation, Filtration, Solution, 
Multiplication and Projection.

In ancient times, during the early evolution of the great clans, 
there were some that refused to renounce the old gods and their 
ways. These few were considered outcasts by the clans, and  
persecuted for their beliefs. Greatly outnumbered, and with no 
stronghold of their own, they were quickly captured and set 
adrift, to die, on The Great Dragon Sea. Ehecatl, the god of the wind 
saw their plight and recognized them as Xunti, (children of the
old gods). He brought them to an island sanctuary, that had been 
prepared for them since the beginning of time. Here they were
taught the old ways and embued with the power of the gods. 
Little else is known of Xunti and they remain shrouded in secrecy 
to this very day. Though never documented by eyewitnesses,
the charred, mutilated remains of their human sacrifices, tell
of a religion steeped in violence and cruelty.

 Xunti is a cult, extremely secretive, a brotherhood of religious
fanatics, where the concern, desire, or enemy of one is shared
by all. Their leaders are oracles, communing always with the gods
for guidance and direction. Ancient prophecy speaks of Xunti
as a small, close-knit band of believers, never more than 30
strong. It was decreed to them by Xiuhtecutli to aid those
who can not or will not tolerate the faithless ways of the clans.
Therefore, to those known as outcasts, Xunti shows favor by
donating gold for the removal of these so-called flags of shame.
Only the most devout need apply for admittance into the ranks 
of Xunti. Every applicant must first have experienced the 
meaningless existance offered by the clans of the infidels.
A petition for audience must then be written to Xunti. Each applicant 
will then be brought before the Great Prophets to be tried as 
though by fire. If one is then deemed worthy to proceed, the
Oracles will commune with the gods (through rituals of prayer,
human sacrifice, and bloodletting) until the decision of the
almighty Xiuhtecutli is revealed. Entrance into Xunti will always
be accompanied by a human sacrifice.

Be forewarned!
Some, in seeking Xunti, have never been heard from again.

Syntax: unoutcast

If you leave a clan, whether by choice or force, you become an 'Outcast'.
Outcasts cannot join a clan and can still attack and be attacked by clan
members in the special PK rooms.

There should be little reason to leave a clan; the clan theme and rules are
made clear to you before you join the clan and you accept those rules.
Extreme cases (clans not regarding a given theme at all, leadership abuse,
etc.) may have Imm intervention, but '<leader> is a <insert expletive> and 
didn't do what I wanted!' is an issue left to you and your clan.  

To remove outcast status, type 'unoutcast'.  There is a fee of 25,000 gold
per level (current, not total level).


What if my leaders aren't active, or ignore my note?
Sometimes, leaders are unavailable to outcast players (AFK, not logged in,
etc.).  If leaders are not on regularly to request outcasting, post a note
to Imm and your clan leaders' names on Personal board.  If you have 
received no response from clan leaders within 48 hours of posting the note,
you may contact an Imm to have him/her outcast you.

Leaders may not outright refuse outcast requests.  This does not mean,
however, that it is unreasonable for them to ask for a few hours to think
about the situation, cool off after an argument, etc.  If the timeframe is
unreasonable or this tactic is used multiple times (and can be validated),
Imms may take immediate action.

Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

The lobby (G)
  The sheer size of the theatre's lobby is breathtaking. Tall marble
columns support the ornately carved dome ceiling, and the walls are adorned
with playbills from previous and future shows. This is where the crowds
gather before the show, and where they wait out intermissions with lively
discussions. The continuous low, humming drone of conversation is 
occasionally punctuated by loud, boisterous laughter coming from the large
group of people congregating near the entryway. On the southern side of the
room stands a towering pair of arched double-doors leading into the
theatre. Ushers stand ready, programs in hand, to show you to your seat.

  This central location in the tower is brightly lit, though you do not
see any light source. A spiral staircase makes its way up to the landing,
before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through
the halls, much of it going to the shops on the next floor. Shadows flicker
lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the
south.

dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

  These black mountains seem darker then the ones prior.  There are large

hunting for anything living to sustain itself.  Misty trail ways makes it
difficult to know which way to go and could be hiding numerous amounts of
things to make the course more treacherous.  The journey onward must be
proceeded with caution.

Tunnels stretch northwards *inside* of the mountain for as far as you can

a gigantic cavern inside of this mountain!  Many humanoid figures move about
the cavern ahead; it looks as though they are following stone roads
traveling around the sides of the cavern.  Oddly, the tunnels ahead are not
dark, though you see no torches or lanterns burning.

Path to the fortress
  Moving cautiously through the tunnels, you soon find the source of the
light.  Several puny-looking goblins cower along the walls as you enter the
room, as though they expect to be kicked at any time.  You notice they are
holding some strange slug-like creatures that are giving off a luminary
glow.  Seeing your curiosity, a goblin stands up and places a slug on the
wall of the tunnel.  It promptly sticks in place and its glow brightens just
a bit, making your vision all the better.  Apparently this kind of light
does not hurt the goblin's eyes as does the sunlight.  From the east you
hear a snarl, and the puny goblins scramble to their feet and quickly begin
applying more slugs.

Before the fortress
  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?

Fortress intersection [**> PK <**]
  Standing in an intersection in the fortress, you're unsure which way to
go.  Looking around you feel something grabbing onto your foot and you
glance down.  A clawed hand is reaching up through a grate in the floor.  A
low hiss rises up to your ears and you yank your foot back to the sound of
snarls and cursing.  Whatever way you decide to go it's obvious that down is
not one of the choices.

everyone knows goblins snore like a storm.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)

  The courtyard seems to be getting smaller towards the east, but people
still travel through here as much as any other place.  You've noticed that
many of the locals appear to walk around with their head hung down, as if
they have something to fear by interacting with outsiders such as yourself.

makes you dizzy as you try to navigate through the clinic. You consider 
letting a janitor know the lights need to be replaced, but it would be 
impossible for them not to know this already. There's a small door to the

a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a

beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely

rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

>>    The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

>>    In Black Cat Tower (G)
  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more

and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Inside The Iron Gates Of The Keep
  Once inside the gates you enter a small courtyard.  To the south in front
of the main keep is a river of magma.  Damian uses this river as his first
barrier of protection from intruders.  Here before the river bank a nice set
of guards is here to greet you.  Perhaps they are not as nice as one would
hope.  

[ Exits: south ]
     A towering iron gate blocks you from exiting the keep.

Amongst The Killing Fields
  The sun burning high above, makes venturing across the blood tinted
sand almost impossible. With each step your feet sink into the scalding
hot sands of this barren wasteland. In the near distance there is a
traveling wagon train moving from the East to the West. These wagons
do not seem to be carrying wares and goods, like a normal wagon train
should. A closer inspection reveals that each wagon contains a coffin, or
another type of container to hold the deceased. Perhaps these are the
infamous wagons that take the dead to the afterlife.

Along The Magma River
  The heat off the flowing river of lava is almost unbearable.  Nearly to
the point of melting your face, you cannot stand too close to this river. 
Vile creatures, obviously immune to the extreme heat, crawl out of the river
in hopes of a quick meal.  Hopefully you are not on the menu.

Along The Magma River
  Thank goodness the river seems to be flowing down into a chasm of some
sorts.  The banks of the river grow steeper and steeper until they are
nearly cliffs dropping down into the molten rock below.  Falling now would
surely mean death, so it might be a good idea to stay away from the edge.

  Once inside the gates you enter a small courtyard.  To the south in front
of the main keep is a river of magma.  Damian uses this river as his first
barrier of protection from intruders.  Here before the river bank a nice set
of guards is here to greet you.  Perhaps they are not as nice as one would
hope.

If you are confused on what to do as a new player, see 'help newhelp'.

The newbie channel is the first channel available to new players.  It is
available to all players in their first mort until superhero and under 300
hours. This should be the first place to ask MUD-related questions.  
Immortals, Helpers (see 'help helper'), and Advisors ('help advisor'), as 
well as other new players, all watch this channel and try to respond to 
questions and offer assistance as needed.

Please use this channel instead of asking Helpers/Advisors or immortals
questions in tells- you will have a much quicker response when everyone can
see your question, and may be asking the same question another player has
but hasn't asked yet.

Once you lose access to newbietalk, you will still have access to the 
Question & Answer channel, where all available players may offer their 
assistance.

'Gossip' will redirect to newbietalk until level 5, when a player can use
the gossip channel (see 'help gossip').  'nb' is also a shortcut for the
newbie channel- 'newbie Hi' and 'nb Hi' will have the same result.

See 'help channels' for a list of functions that can be used on this 
channel.

  Thank goodness the river seems to be flowing down into a chasm of some

nearly cliffs dropping down into the molten rock below.  Falling now would
surely mean death, so it might be a good idea to stay away from the edge.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

This is where we cover what your application should consist of and give you
an example application.

All applications should be on Personal Board and addressed to Boot. For
the Subject, please reference the words "application" or "joining". Now just
like a job application, you wouldn't just put "I want the job!". We'd like a
bit more information as the following example shows:

Hello, my name is Barney.
I have been playing for 15 years and I really enjoy doing quests and
campaigns. :)
I would like to join bootcamp because I would like some extra help
learning where to level.
I'm pretty active, I really enjoy the game and hope to make some new
friends. :D

The above is an example of a good application. Here is an example of a bad one:
"i would like to join boot camp, it is awsome"

Not much information at all is given there and it doesn't look as though
a lot of effort was put into writing it. This doesn't give your potential
future clannies a lot of incentive to get to know you better. Most clans
would prefer something along the lines of the first note for an application
(or in many cases, quite a bit more than that). We here at Boot Camp are not
as strict, but we do want to help you learn to write application notes now so
that you know the basics for clan applications as you continue your
Aard career.

Hi, my name is Chen.

I was in the boot clan before but I became inactive a while after.
I have been active for a while and I was hoping it's possible to rejoin the clan.
Line too long. Please do not go over 79 characters.

I have been active for a while and I was hoping
 it's possible to rejoin the clan.

I'd like to be in the clan because I want some more
people to talk to that is a little more close knitted than randos,
and hopefully I can help others though I am still relatively new.

I play almost daily now and for varied hours so even if
I'm idle I hope to join in on some conversations.

Hope you're all doing well,
~ Kumo

| Hi, my name is Chen.
| 
| I was in the boot clan before but I became inactive a while after.
| 
| I have been active for a while and I was hoping
|  it's possible to rejoin the clan.
| 
| I'd like to be in the clan because I want some more
| people to talk to that is a little more close knitted than randos,
| and hopefully I can help others though I am still relatively new.
| 
| I play almost daily now and for varied hours so even if
| I'm idle I hope to join in on some conversations.

| Hope you're all doing well,

This is where we cover what your application should consist of and give you
an example application.

All applications should be on Personal Board and addressed to Boot. For
the Subject, please reference the words "application" or "joining". Now just
like a job application, you wouldn't just put "I want the job!". We'd like a
bit more information as the following example shows:

Type: "forum personal"
Current forum changed to Personal. You can read and write in this forum.
Type: "note write"
The recipient of this post must NOT include: "all"
To      :  boot
Subject :  Joining Boot
Enter your post. Type END on an empty line to finish.

Hello, my name is Barney.
I have been playing for 15 years and I really enjoy doing quests and
campaigns. :)
I would like to join bootcamp because I would like some extra help
learning where to level.
I'm pretty active, I really enjoy the game and hope to make some new
friends. :D

The above is an example of a good application. Here is an example of a bad one:
"i would like to join boot camp, it is awsome"

Not much information at all is given there and it doesn't look as though
a lot of effort was put into writing it. This doesn't give your potential
future clannies a lot of incentive to get to know you better. Most clans
would prefer something along the lines of the first note for an application
(or in many cases, quite a bit more than that). We here at Boot Camp are not
as strict, but we do want to help you learn to write application notes now so
that you know the basics for clan applications as you continue your
Aard career.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.  

[ Exits: north east south up ]
The world famous Master Questor of Aylor hands out quests to adventurers.

Notes are created by players to communicate on Aardwolf's longer-term forum/
communication system. There are several forums/boards, each with specific
topics. The help files that deal with note reading and writing are listed
below.

This help file deals with sorting and reading notes.  To compose a note,
please see 'help note writing'.

Syntax:

note                      Reads next unread note on the current board or
                          moves to next board with unread notes.
note read <number>        Reads a certain note.
note read <last|again>    Re-read last note.
note reset <num>          Resets your "last read" pointer.
note reset                Resets last read pointer to previous note read.
                          Can be used repeatedly to move backwards.
note peek <num>           Reads a note without changing last read pointer.
note unread               Shows all unread notes in current board.
note catchup              Marks all notes in current board read.
note catchup all          Marks all notes in all boards except Announce,
                          Mudinfo, and Personal as read.
note from <person>        List notes from a specific person. 'note from  
                          imm'
                          will show all notes from any Immortal.
note to <person>          List notes to a specific person.
note subject <text>       Shows all notes with <text> in subject.
note list ([num])         Shows all (or last <number>) notes.

note threads              Lists all threads.
note threadinfo <num>     Shows a particular post summary.
note fullthread <num>     Shows all notes for a particular thread.

These commands are used for reading notes on Aardwolf's longer-term forum/
communication system.  There are several forums/boards, each with specific
topics.  See 'help board' and 'help subscribe' for information on the board
system itself.  See 'help note writing' for help on writing notes on these
boards.

To read your next unread note, type 'note'. If there are no more notes on
the current board, 'note' will change you to the next subscribed board with
new notes waiting.

To see a list of all notes on a board, type 'note list'. You can also type
'note list <number>' to list only the last <number> notes on a board. Notes
with * before the player's name are currently unread. You can list the
unread notes on the current board by typing 'note unread'.

To read a specific note, type 'note read <number>'. To read the last note
you have read on the current board, type 'note read again'.

There are several ways to view notes from only specific people; you can use
'note subject <specific subject>', 'note to <person/clan>', and 'note from
<person>' to limit notes listed.  The special syntax 'note from imm' will
list notes from all Immortals.

You can set your "last read" pointer by typing 'note reset <number>'. This
will mark the note with the given number and all subsequent notes on the
current board as unread. This can be useful when you want to (re-)read a
thread of notes by typing 'note' without parameters.  You can read a later
note without moving your last read pointer by using 'note peek <number>'.
All notes in the current board can be marked as read by typing 'note
catchup', or use 'note catchup all' to mark all notes (except those on
Announce, Mudinfo, and Personal) as read.

A note and its replies (see details about replies in 'help note writing')
are threaded.  To see all note threads on the current board, type 'note
threads'.  To see which notes are in a thread, use 'note threadinfo <note
number>'.  To quickly list an entire thread of notes, type 'note fullthread
<note number>" or 'note fullthread' by itself to view the entire thread of 
the last note read.  This will not affect your unread pointers.  (Note: 
threads are still a work in progress.)

| Hi, my name is Chen.
| 
| I was in the boot clan before but I became inactive a while after.
| 
| I have been active for a while and I was hoping
|  it's possible to rejoin the clan.
| 
| I'd like to be in the clan because I want some more
| people to talk to that is a little more close knitted than randos,
| and hopefully I can help others though I am still relatively new.
| 
| I play almost daily now and for varied hours so even if
| I'm idle I hope to join in on some conversations.
| 
| Hope you're all doing well,

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Boot Clan Public Hall (G)
  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
A commissary shopkeeper stands here, begging you to type 'list'.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.
     An old electric heater.

Lieutenant Pixie smiles up at you as she gets ready to amputate your leg.
