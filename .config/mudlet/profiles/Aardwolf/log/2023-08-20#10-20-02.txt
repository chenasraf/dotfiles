allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

  Standing knee-deep in the murkish water, you feel the curious sensation
of unseen creatures slithering against you.  The soft ripples trailing
across the water are rythmically entrancing, but you blink back to reality
when you see the reptilian creature which forms the ripples.  With a shiver,
you move on, wanting to be out of the mist-laden swamp.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

whispering upon the breeze hints of the fate that awaits you.

runes, depicted in disturbing detail, the rights of these demons to the
world around.  An alien script, that you cannot read, sends deep, unknown
chills through your soul.  It is as if the very air itself were watching,

Passing Under Some Iron Gates
  Crude, wrought iron gates spread above you as you pass beneath them. 
Weathered with the rust of countless years, they screech in the wind, the
sound like a scream from beyond the pale.  The metal itself has cracked,
split and corroded, weathering the cold wind of Vlad Shamir for countless
aeons.  The whistling of the wind, through the close built iron, sends a
howling wave of noise down the corridor.

  Upon entering this domed room, you are immediately filled with a most
profound sense of dread and horror.  The first thing that strikes you is the
very odd smell on the air, that you cannot quite place.  Then, when you look
again, your stomach turns over..  Laying on one of the benches, staked out,
is something that must have once been humanoid.  The skin has been stripped
from it, and every manner of strange instrument, probe and equipment seems
to be inserted in it somewhere.  As you look, there is a brief flash of
lightning from the sky outside, and with the smell of electricity on the
air, the monstrosity slowly turns, and stares at you.  Before you know it,
you are screaming...

Pathway to Snuckles Forest
  This forest holds magic that is stronger than any other in the land.  The
faeries have spent centuries in this forest, instilling it with magical
powers to protect them from harm.  The trees are like none around.  Each
tree has leaves a different color from the next.  The wind rustles the
leaves and the smell of rain is in the air.

  The path narrows here, giving way to the thousands of mushrooms that grow
on the sides of the path.  The mushrooms are harvested for eating, and grow
back almost overnight.  The snuckles use the mushrooms for a major part of

the trees singing a lovely song to entertain those who are picking
mushrooms.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Meandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind 
after all.

(Golden Aura) A solid looking ironwood bars your way with a shimmering wooden shield.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

floor. There is no ceiling so that the council may leave at any point. Small 
lanterns hang on the finely crafted mahogany walls. A picture of each council
member hangs on the walls.

  This is the Floating Temple of Jupiter, the god of sky and thunder. The 
temple is open to the sky so that supplicants can kneel and pray without 
anything blocking their access to the sky god. Mats are placed around the 
room so that believers can kneel when they pray. The walls are decorated with
the stories of Jupiter. The stairs to the rear of the temple lead upwards to 
the Council Chambers. It is said that the Council makes you pass through the 
temple to remind you of humility before coming before them. A small man-sized
hole is in the floor.

sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A dark forest
  Wandering through the forest was a bad idea. Not only is it cold and wet, but
also unnaturally dark. Regardless of the time of day, the forest stays the 
same brightness. Even the sounds of the forest have been muffled by some 
unseen force. The remains of an animal trail loop and twist around, 
eventually extending out of sight.

[ Exits: north east south west up ]
(Hidden) (Golden Aura) (White Aura) An unusually large firefly is here, and it appears to be
watching you.
(Red Aura) A kobold shaman hides in the underbrush, waiting for an ally.
 
As you enter, you see a kobold dive into some bushes and wait for you to leave.

The corner of the field
  The western barricade that separates the camp from the battleground ends
abruptly far short of the north edge of the battlegrounds.  Any movement
toward the camp itself is stymied by the dense forest that wraps around the
northwestern corner of this field. The kobolds must have decided the 
battlefield was big enough to take advantage of their numbers, because 
the clear-cutting has completely stopped in this corner. They were either 
confident or lazy, but definitely one of the two.

The battle path around the castle
  The southern path around the castle is filled with carnage and mayhem.
Scavengers fight and peck the fallen kobolds which have been pushed off of 
the path. The siege has been the hardest for the kobolds around this path, 
without much damage to the castle. Without warning, the ground shakes with a 
muffled thud, followed by mad cackling. Perhaps that sound could be 
investigated further to discover the source.

  Unlike the other tents, this one is an absolute mess. Vials full of liquid 
and canisters overtopped with unknown powders have been shoved into every 
corner of the tent just to make room for walking. Paths have been intricately
carved into the clutter, creating walkways to the important features of the 
room: the table, a stool in the southwest corner, and a brazier of warm coals
in the northeast corner. Unfurled scrolls, wands of varying shapes and sizes,
and other mystical trinkets are piled high, outlining the only safe passage.
Despite the intense amount of stuff littered about the tent, there is a 
noticeable lack of refuse.

Pathway to Snuckles Forest
  This forest holds magic that is stronger than any other in the land.  The
faeries have spent centuries in this forest, instilling it with magical
powers to protect them from harm.  The trees are like none around.  Each
tree has leaves a different color from the next.  The wind rustles the
leaves and the smell of rain is in the air.

Base of the Tree of Many Colors
  Majestically, this huge tree reaches towards the sky.  It easily takes a
dozen snuckles with stretched hands to circle this tree.  Its leaves are
colored in every possible color imaginable.  Every faerie that comes by here
adds a bit more color with every visit.  This is the main place where the
faeries gather and they treat this tree with respect.  Shay, the keeper of
the forest lives in this tree.

It is amazing how the faeries can form a room out of leaves and make
furniture and such without ever harming the tree.  The tree is old and the

Destiney's Hideaway
  A small room has been made out of the pink leaves that adorn this tree.
It is amazing how the faeries can form a room out of leaves and make
furniture and such without ever harming the tree.  The tree is old and the
pink leaves mingle with the multi-colored leaves of the tree that grows
very close to this one.  The tall tree is one of the oldest in the forest.
The only tree older than this one is the one with the multi-colored leaves
that Shay and Faydra live in.  

[ Exits: south down ]
(Invis) (Golden Aura) (White Aura) Destiney flies around the room playing in faerie dust and humming
softly.

The Tree Of Many Colors (G)
  This tree is referred to as "The Tree of Many Colors" by all who travel
the land.  It is the oldest and tallest tree in all the forest.  Each leaf
has been painted a different color, making this the most unusual, as well
as the most astounding tree in all the land.  The tree itself seems to be
alive.  Its radiant glow appears to be an aura of pure goodness.  This
tree serves as the home of Shay, the keeper of the forest, and her sister
Faydra.

Shay's Atelier
  Shay needed a place to do her magical deeds without anyone knowing where
it was.  She decided to hollow out a small branch and make it into a room. 
Shay worked a long time carving the walls into shelves to make room for all
her needed supplies.  Shay brought only one other faerie here and that was
Faydra, her sister.  Faydra was told to keep this room a secret.  Shay knew
that if it was discovered the magic of the forest was in grave danger.  

[ Exits: down ]
     (Invis) (Magic) (Cursed) A small cauldron is near the bay window.
(Hidden) (Golden Aura) Shay flies about frantically in search of her lost book.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  Waves gently lap at the glimmering sands here, creating a calming rhythmic 
hum in your ears. Just off the shallow waters you see a group of ships, 
seamen tirelessly unloading supplies. Inland a short distance, you spot a 
makeshift camp positioned just before a towering forest. A dim rainbow arcs 
up in front of the camp like an entryway.

  Barely audible, the ringing of axes upon the ironwood trees is but a 
distraction here. The air is still in this dense thicket, and yet there 
remains an eerie howl amidst the trees. Before you, the trees become too 
dense to pass. In either direction you see a narrow path onward, through the 
ironwood.

The Perfect Road (G)
  You are on the most beautifully kept and built road you've ever seen. 
Each individual stone appears so clean it may have been scrubbed with a
toothbrush, and is set so flawlessly you can barely tell where one stone
ends and the next begins.  The road travels for what appears to be a fairly
short distance towards the north, heading for the largest dome you've ever
seen.  Could that be the infamous Gladiator's Arena?

Outside the Arena (G)
  The road you are on remains nearly perfect in every way, and cleaner than
any you've seen before; yet now you can see signs of traffic on the cobbled
stones, where decades of long hard use have begun to wear the stones a
little TOO smooth.  In front of you is the single largest building you've
ever seen; easily ten stories tall, and at least eight thousand feet in
diameter, this perfect dome is reputed to have been built so well that a
whisper spoken anywhere inside would carry to any other part of the
building.  The walls are unbelievably smooth, and so clean that the sun
practically reflects off of the dark grey granite.  An enormous archway to
the north, fifty feet at its peak and twice as wide, provides access to the
dome.

The Entrance Guard says, "I'm sure you can afford more than that, but I

Inside the Gigantic Archway
  Rising to a curved peak some 50 feet above you, the archway you stand
in now is easily the biggest you've ever seen...  Or heard of...  Or even
imagined!  Yet every inch of it is spotlessly clean, and was immaculately
carved, crafted, and set.  Each stone integrates so seamlessly with the next
that not even a speck of mortar is visible, and the entire archway looks
almost like a natural formation.  Even the intricate carvings, spaced at
even intervals approximately one foot apart, that cover the archway were
done by such a master artisan that you could easily believe they were
natural.  The designs seem to have no apparent pattern or significance. 
They seem to be merely random swirls, loops, and assorted geometric
patterns, shaped in such a way that if you stare at them for long enough,
you can see a myriad of different half-formed images, which never quite come
completely to the foreground.  It's eerily similar to the effect you get
when looking at the clouds for a long time, and can see shapes emerging, but
never quite defining themselves.  A little to the east, the dome opens up
into a vastly cavernous space, so large it's hard to believe it's truly
housed within a man-made building...

  This entire portion of the arena is covered in dirt, rocks, and weeds. 
Around 10,000 square feet in all, it provides the perfect setting for large
battles involving many combatants in a warlike environment.  Strategically
placed bunkers, buildings, and fences add to the setting.  The field itself
is often reserved on request for up to two full days, allowing the opposing
armies to spend the first day preparing the field with everything from
barbed wire to hidden pits, before engaging in their "war" on the second.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A small path through the trees (1990)

Gateway to Monastery
  As you step into a small cove, rays of light filter through the
trees overhead, allowing you to make out a moss-covered wall buried
in the brush.  Pleasant sounds of birds and trickling water carry
through the leaves, relaxing and soothing the soul.  To the east,
an opening can be seen.

  This is the Floating Temple of Jupiter, the god of sky and thunder. The 
temple is open to the sky so that supplicants can kneel and pray without 
anything blocking their access to the sky god. Mats are placed around the 
room so that believers can kneel when they pray. The walls are decorated with
the stories of Jupiter. The stairs to the rear of the temple lead upwards to 
the Council Chambers. It is said that the Council makes you pass through the 
temple to remind you of humility before coming before them. A small man-sized
hole is in the floor.

[ Exits: east south west up down ]
(Red Aura) A cleric blesses you in the name of Jupiter.
You flee from combat!
You lose 10 exp for your cowardice.

A Somber Walkway (G)
  After ascending a stairway of clouds leading into the heavens, an individual 
would probably expect to find something surreal at the top. Many an explorer 
has been left disappointed, however, since this is nothing more than the 
Ascension Bluff Nursing Home. The architect thought that a stairway of clouds
would make the residents feel closer to the gods. Unfortunately, all this 
served to do was make this location less suitable for visitors and employees 
to frequent. Further to this, when one closely inspects the clouds, they will
come to the realization that they are not real clouds at all, but rather 
millions of tiny cotton balls affixed to a steel frame. Interestingly enough,
it seems that a nursing home in the clouds acquires quite the eclectic bunch 
of residents. Anyone who chances by a for a visit will find that this nursing
home contains more than just your ordinary sampling of senior citizens.

A Somber Walkway
  This nursing home in the clouds was created by the great architect Harald
van Godwhine. Here is a quote from the acclaimed artist himself: 

     I used the grassiest grass and the treeiest trees to create a canopy
     of comfort and love for my nursing home in the sky. I injected the
     cotton ball clouds with Griffon's Blood in order to create a buoyant
     surface for the nursing home to balance upon. After that, it was all
     about adding soft textures in order to mimic the sensation of walking
     on a cloud. I wanted to call the nursing home Cloud Nine, but
     unfortunately that is not the name that was chosen in the end. Too

This architectural masterpiece has been ranked number 100 on the extensive

Harald van Godwhine's great chagrin. He was never able to figure out how
to build a structure upon the elusive material of real cloud.

A Somber Walkway
  The ground here has been built upon a study steel wire framework. It is so 
sturdy, in fact, that an individual is led to believe that they are walking 
on terra firma rather than treading 3000 feet up in the sky. This entire 
walkway has been carefully crafted into a beautiful courtyard that leads 
right up to the front doors of the nursing home. Dogwoods in a constant state
of bloom have been planted all along the walkway, their white blossoms intent
on mimicking the idea of clouds. White rose bushes were added to fill in gaps
between the trees, and the ground aside of the walkway is covered in actual 
growing cotton. Little bits of fluff float around in the air and tempt the 
formulation of a sneeze.

Entrance to Ascension Bluff
  At the entrance to the Ascension Bluff Nursing home the pathway widens into a
semi-circle of flagstones that are surrounded by several stout wooden 
benches. A low-set stone wall hugs all of these particulars, and three wide, 
curved steps lead up to the front entrance of the nursing home. This nursing 
home has been made to look like a lodge in hopes that the residents will feel
like they are simply here on vacation. The roof has a steep slope and the 
exterior of the building has been carefully crafted from wooden logs. Patio 
doors lead straight out to the front gardens and walkway from many locations 
along the front of the building. Even more light is brought into the nursing 
home via expansive, arched windows that take up much of the wall-space above
the patio doors.

>>    The Reception Area
  The architectural team for this nursing home pondered the fact that in the 
beginning, these types of facilities started out as extensions to hospitals.
Therefore, to a certain extent, folks expect that a nursing home will retain 
that appearance. The team also recognized that the building's entrance is 
incredibly important in giving visitors that positive first impression of 
what the overall facility will be like. So the designer team worked hard to 
create a spacious, colorful, and inviting entrance. They wanted to imbue an 
overwhelming feeling of happiness within the individual as they took their 
first steps into the building. To do this, they utilized a palette of warm 
color tones for several large wall murals, as well as floors crafted with a 
tile mosaic finish. They added comfortable furniture to relax in, and spared 
no expense on an extravagant, cathedral ceiling, made perfect with the 
addition of incredible skylights.

A Sanitary Hallway
  The hallways in this nursing home are wide and the floors are made of 
hardwood. Wooden floors are a good choice for a nursing home since they are 
stylish, and do not accumulate dirt and hidden debris in the uncontrollable 
fashion that carpets are susceptible to. Every so often along the hall, there
is a bench covered in soft paisley fabric that a tired soul can have a quick 
rest on if their journey becomes too treacherous. Above each of these benches
has been hung a painting. Each painting portrays a different view of the 
countryside. Each paint stroke is visible on these paintings and extra 
attention has been given to the way that the light effects the images. This 
particular hallway is quite short, and only has three rooms of residents 
leading off of it. If heading west, an individual will end up at the main 
entrance to the building.

  Directly across from the door to Robert's room is a throne. Yes, seriously, 
he's got a throne in here. A red carpet has been rolled out that leads to the
throne. The carpet is a bit creased in places and buckles as well, but it's 
obvious that it's meant to lead straight to the throne. Chintzy looking 
paintings with overly-extravagant gilded gold frames have been hung at 
intervals from one end of the room to the other. A chandelier is hanging 
crookedly from the ceiling and it looks to be terribly tarnished. Every 
resident gets a basic room that comes with a bed supplied by the nursing 
home. They are encouraged to furnish the room further in order to add their 
own personal touch. Each resident room has tongue and groove boards an inch 
thick, installed vertically for the walls, and thicker boards for the floor 
and roof.

A Sanitary Hallway
  The hallways in this nursing home are wide and the floors are made of 
hardwood. Wooden floors are a good choice for a nursing home since they are 
stylish, and do not accumulate dirt and hidden debris in the uncontrollable 
fashion that carpets are susceptible to. Every so often along the hall, there
is a bench covered in soft paisley fabric that a tired soul can have a quick 
rest on if their journey becomes too treacherous. Above each of these benches
has been hung a painting. Each painting portrays a different view of the 
countryside. Each paint stroke is visible on these paintings and extra 
attention has been given to the way that the light effects the images. This 
particular hallway is quite short, and only has three rooms of residents 
leading off of it. If heading west, an individual will end up at the main 
entrance to the building.

The Reception Area
  The architectural team for this nursing home pondered the fact that in the 
beginning, these types of facilities started out as extensions to hospitals.
Therefore, to a certain extent, folks expect that a nursing home will retain 
that appearance. The team also recognized that the building's entrance is 
incredibly important in giving visitors that positive first impression of 
what the overall facility will be like. So the designer team worked hard to 
create a spacious, colorful, and inviting entrance. They wanted to imbue an 
overwhelming feeling of happiness within the individual as they took their 
first steps into the building. To do this, they utilized a palette of warm 
color tones for several large wall murals, as well as floors crafted with a 
tile mosaic finish. They added comfortable furniture to relax in, and spared 
no expense on an extravagant, cathedral ceiling, made perfect with the 
addition of incredible skylights.

  This section of the reception area contains several supporting columns.
Light streams in through the ceiling's skylights and distracts the eye to the
various bits of the floor's mosaic that it happens to hit. Here the floor's 
mosaic depicts a tangle of flourishing leaves. The leaves in the mosaic have 
also been extended to the room's pillars by being painted upon them. In this 
manner, the leaves continue all the way up toward the ceiling. To the east is
the room of a resident. To the north is the main hallway that leads through 
the nursing home. Continuing to the south will lead an individual to the main
entryway of the building.

lullaby that repeats itself in a loop. Now, that might get a tad bit annoying
for an individual who happens to spend a lot of time at this desk, but then 
again, maybe anyone working here would just tune it out after a while. The

  Wow, this room is a busy place! Dozens of gadgets that somehow run on their

look like bugs which are rummaging through a pile of small, scrap bits, and 
sorting them into separate baskets. Several shelves are filled with rolled-up
scrolls that make an individual wonder what sort of plans for machines are 
written-out upon them. The most complete looking invention in here is a 
marble machine that sends a marble on an interesting journey if it is placed 
upon it. There are several other large objects that look about halfway to 
completion. This causes one to ponder, does Phil ever actually finish his 
creations, or does he move on to a new one every time he gets bored or 
frustrated? Every resident gets a basic room that comes with a bed supplied 
by the nursing home. They are encouraged to furnish the room further in order
to add their own personal touch. Each resident room has tongue and groove 
boards an inch thick, installed vertically for the walls, and thicker boards

cabinet that is filled with vials and glass containers of interesting-looking
substances. There are a few skulls on top of this cabinet that are being used
as candle holders. They look quite strange since they have extra eye sockets 
and over-sized jaws, so they must come from very rare creatures. There are 
also a few leather upholstered chairs for an individual to sit on while they 
read a book. However, these chairs have each been piled high with stacks of 
books so it would take a bit of reorganization to make them available to sit 
upon. Every resident gets a basic room that comes with a bed supplied by the

  It is nice and warm in here. This is mainly because the room is heated by a

bathtub in the corner that is filled with hot bath water. One of the reasons 
that this nursing home has such a great reputation is due to its modern way 
of utilizing a plumbing system in order to provide fresh water for the 
patients. The other residents share a common bathing chamber, but Harold was 
given a special bath all of his own since hydrotherapy was deemed a necessity
in order to help treat his arthritic pains.

  Here is a bar where visitors can serve themselves tea or a cup of coffee (of 
the decaffeinated variety, unfortunately). There is no one here to serve the 
drinks, but a fundraising jar has been placed on the bar so that those who 
partake in a beverage can place a gold coin inside. To the west and south are
rooms that house nursing home residents. Each door has had its occupant's

  In this section of the nursing home, a reception desk has been built to stand
along the northern wall. In order to save some gold, the nursing home 
acquires volunteers to work at this reception desk. Calming music drifts 
forth here from some indiscernible source. It seems to be an unfamiliar 
lullaby that repeats itself in a loop. Now, that might get a tad bit annoying
for an individual who happens to spend a lot of time at this desk, but then 
again, maybe anyone working here would just tune it out after a while. The 
mural painted behind this desk shows an image of trees stretching out their 
branches in order to hold each other. Some sort of high-tech magical visual 
device has been installed near the ceiling in this corner of the room, 
seemingly to scan the entryway for unwanted guests.

  Two sides of this part of the nursing home lounge are contained by walls that
join together in the southeast corner. A sectional couch runs along the 
entirety of these walls, providing enough seating for the bulk of the nursing

generally where everyone will meet if there is an excursion or meeting 
planned for the residents. Sometimes trips are planned to The Grand City of

  Glaadys' room is simple and neat. She has a table and chairs off to one side 
of the room, and on top of the table is a crystal dish that is filled with 
freshly baked cookies. The furthest wall from the door has a firm beige couch
that is topped with many plush beige cushions. On the walls hang quaint 
paintings and drawings of horses and cottages. Beside the bed there is also a
tall wooden wardrobe where Glaadys stores her clothing. Every resident gets a 
basic room that comes with a bed supplied by the nursing home. They are 
encouraged to furnish the room further in order to add their own personal 
touch. Each resident room has tongue and groove boards an inch thick, 
installed vertically for the walls, and thicker boards for the floor and 
roof.

The dining table has six chairs, but the question is, does anyone ever come 
by for a dinner party? That is pretty doubtful considering the fact that most
folks run in the other direction when they see Polly. Someone who could 
spontaneously combust at any moment has a very tough time making any friends

room, urging folks to explore the most uninhabited areas of Andolor, but 
aside from this, things have basically been thrown around on the ground and 
left wherever they have fallen. The janitor hates this of course. One day, 
after a heated verbal argument with Harry, he swore he would never set foot 
in here again. And he has been true to his word! It is difficult to take a 
step without stumbling over a discarded piece of clothing or a torn up bit of
parchment. Every resident gets a basic room that comes with a bed supplied by

A Sanitary Hallway
  This section of the hallway is similar to the last, aside from a metal case 
with a glass cover that has been hung upon the wall. Writing across the front
of the glass says, 'In case of emergency, break glass'. Inside the case there
is an ax. Perhaps the old folks are meant to chop themselves out of here if 
all the exits somehow become blocked. Well, it's hard to imagine a scenario 
where things would come down to that, but it's certainly good to be prepared 
in for an emergency if one does occur.

there is a classy loveseat that also contains an element of flower-patterned 
fabric within its design. A side table lurks beside the loveseat, which of

a rug in here that is covered with a flower pattern. Abigail's pride and joy 
sits in the furthest corner of the room; her magnificent grand piano. This 
seems to be the only item she owns that is not covered in flowers! Every 
resident gets a basic room that comes with a bed supplied by the nursing 
home. They are encouraged to furnish the room further in order to add their 
own personal touch. Each resident room has tongue and groove boards an inch 
thick, installed vertically for the walls, and thicker boards for the floor

smell especially pungent. There is only one laundry sorcerer for all of the 
different buildings that hire one in the area, so he usually only swings by 
once a week. This is why anyone would want to do a quick, cursory clean of a 
ridiculously stinky item.

>>    The Public Washroom
  This washroom has made an attempt at modernization. It is a single stall, 
with a wooden toilet, and there is a rudimentary plumbing system in the 
building, so the waste does end up in a sort of sewage system that eventually
sends everything into a river. Unfortunately, it seems no one has thought too
much about where the river leads to. Luckily there have been no complaints 
from downriver thus far, so that is promising. There is also a sink that can 
deliver running water, and a small mirror to look into in order to powder 
your nose or whatnot. The smell in here is a bit intense and for some reason 
the floor is all wet. Eww, so is the toilet paper. Hmm, it might not be a 
good idea to speculate upon the reason as to why this room is so wet.

great wall of rock. Several varieties of ferns are growing through the rocks 
of this wall as well, creating a beautifully tranquil scene. The walkway here
forms a bit of a bridge and the waterfall's water mysteriously disappears

  The first thing an individual sees when they walk into this room is the big 
wooden sign suspended from the ceiling that says "Bedroom of Booty". This 
room clearly must belong to a pirate, or an aspiring pirate at the very 
least. A cabinet that takes up one whole wall is filled with dusty containers
that look like they might contain alcohol. Some are empty, and others are 
full, but it seems to be quite the extensive collection. A coffee table in 
the middle of the room has been painted with a skull and crossbones symbol, 
and a dozen large treasure chests are stacked into one corner of the room.
The only other object of note in the room is a shelf over the bed that 
contains small, detailed models that are most likely depicting pirate ships.
Garrett must really miss life at sea. Every resident gets a basic room that 
comes with a bed supplied by the nursing home. They are encouraged to furnish
the room further in order to add their own personal touch. Each resident room
has tongue and groove boards an inch thick, installed vertically for the 
walls, and thicker boards for the floor and roof.

create a room that would let in the maximum amount of sun possible. All of

been separated by wood trim. The windows are fixed in place, since wherever 
they have been built, they take up the whole wall-space. The walls are 
nothing more than a frame to help support the windows, and then these windows

  The ground here has been built upon a study steel wire framework. It is so

on terra firma rather than treading 3000 feet up in the sky. This entire 
walkway has been carefully crafted into a beautiful courtyard that leads 
right up to the front doors of the nursing home. Dogwoods in a constant state
of bloom have been planted all along the walkway, their white blossoms intent
on mimicking the idea of clouds. White rose bushes were added to fill in gaps
between the trees, and the ground aside of the walkway is covered in actual 
growing cotton. Little bits of fluff float around in the air and tempt the

A Somber Walkway (1986)

A Somber Walkway (G)
  After ascending a stairway of clouds leading into the heavens, an individual 
would probably expect to find something surreal at the top. Many an explorer 
has been left disappointed, however, since this is nothing more than the 
Ascension Bluff Nursing Home. The architect thought that a stairway of clouds
would make the residents feel closer to the gods. Unfortunately, all this 
served to do was make this location less suitable for visitors and employees 
to frequent. Further to this, when one closely inspects the clouds, they will
come to the realization that they are not real clouds at all, but rather 
millions of tiny cotton balls affixed to a steel frame. Interestingly enough,
it seems that a nursing home in the clouds acquires quite the eclectic bunch 
of residents. Anyone who chances by a for a visit will find that this nursing
home contains more than just your ordinary sampling of senior citizens.

  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

  The Prime Celestial Meridian neatly divides the sky into eastern and

two sections on the other side of the sky.  It meets the Celestial Equator
at the Major Equatorial Locus in the very center of the sky.  On the other
side, it also meets with the Fundamental Celestial Plane to form the Major
Fundamental Locus, thus also intersecting with the antipode of that locus,
the Major Fundamental Antipode.

The Dark Path
  The broken lands!  Among the living, there are few more frightening areas
in the world. For in the broken lands exist the dreaded darklords, demons,
undead and cursed beings of the world.  It was the sin of those dark souls
which caused the fall of the gods and the rise of darkness.  Most fearsome
of all is Georfram, the dark vampyrelord.  And his fort is rumored to be at
the end of the dark path!

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Goat Skull Gate (G) [**> PK <**]
  There is a large iron gate here, with a short elf guarding it.  The gate
is going north into a mountain. There appears to be a cave north of here,
but you can't see through the gate very well.  There are many different
rocks embedded in the mountain.  It almost seems that they form a pattern.
You can hear the dripping of water from inside the caves.
There is also a cold draft of air hitting you.  Perhaps this is the
entrance to the legendary Dark Elf Fortress?

  This huge cave once belonged to the great dragon Smaug, but when the dark

of Smaug and placed him here to guard the fortress.  The smell of death
makes you feel sick.

Searching the Halls
  This room smells of fresh blood taken from dark elves.  The dwarves
appear to be looking for the device that will transport them to the rest of
the caves.  The walls do not drip of water now but of a mixture of water and
dirt.  A drop falls on your head and clanks against your helmet.  You
wonder whether you should help the dwarves find the portal...  You can look
east or west of here.  

[ Exits: east west ]
     (Invis) (Magic) A swirling maelstrom that leads somewhere ravages the area here.

  This part of the fortress is cold.  It gives you a chill being here, and
you wish you were home.  There are maps on the walls with X's on them. 
Perhaps the X marks their next point of attack?  The invading dwarves
obviously have not come through these parts yet, not one kind soul lurks
about, except for the captured slaves.  The caves get wider and larger to
the east and to the west they seem to be more confining.

  You have stumbled into a locked abandoned storage room. Cobwebs cover 
forgotten flamethrowers and other miscellaneous military gear. You are 
amazed by how huge the room is and begin to wonder how such a room could 
have been abandoned. Most of it looks like junk but if you were to take 
a closer look there might be some hidden treasures. Deciding this would 
be a safe place to leave your non valuables you lock the door.

  Here people come to vote. Even in the army, the most

all votes here are binding, but there is a time and
a place for everything.

Plastered on the walls are some reminders of what boot 
camp stands for:

Theme:
Boot Camp is, in essence, a clan made up of new players. Based
on the idea of helping the Helpershelper, this clan will take in new
players and let them learn until they decide to become teachers or
are ready to move on to bigger and better things.

Clan Decisions:
All decisions in the clan are made through voting by 
the Clan Leaders and rank 5 or 6 players. Although the 
clan will be primarily democratic, Clan Leaders or the 
Helpershelper have final say and can overrule any votes 
if they feel they go against the Clan's Petition, Theme,

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

The beautiful genie is in need of someone to free her from her entrapment. 
Many years ago she was taken prisoner by a heinous genie general and 
everyone who has ever loved her has died trying to save her. Left unchecked, 
the general's armies will continue to grow. If he becomes too powerful, 
he will attempt to usurp control of the entire genie kingdom.  If this 
were to happen, the future of the genies would be a very dark one indeed.  
A strong warrior is needed to abolish this evil general.  

Are you capable enough to help?

Syntax: say <message>
        think <message>
        whisper <player> <message>

These commands are all used to talk to other people in the gaming world.

Say sends the message after say to all players in your current room.  ' is
an alias for 'say'; say Hi and 'Hi  have the same result.

Say also has special 'modifiers' that can go at the end of your sentence.
For example, 'say How are you?' becomes "You ask 'How are you?'"  These 
modifiers are:

Think acts like say, but puts the message in thought bubbles rather than
saying it directly.  To use this on channels, see 'help channels'.

Whisper will say something to a single player in the same room as you, but
other people will only see '<Player> whispers something to <target>'.
Note: the thieves' class channel, cant, also shows as '<Player> whispers'
when used- this is a global chat channel and not the same as the whisper
command.  (See 'help class channels').

Basic Syntax: Type 'Channels' to see a list.
              Type [channel name] to toggle on / off.
              Use '[channel] *off [minutes]' to turn off temporarily.
              Use 'channels curse' to see a list of curse allowed channels.
              Use '[channel] -h' or '[channel] -h <# lines / text>' to see 
              channel history.

Further details and other usage options are in the wall of text below.

There are many means of communication on Aardwolf and channels are one of
the most important.  Channels on Aardwolf can change dynamically based on
topics relevant at the time.  To see a list of channels, type 'channels'.
To toggle a channel on or off, type its name.

Each class also has its own private channel which only members of that
class can see. These are covered in 'help class channels'.  Information on
each channel's particular rules and guidelines can be found in 'help 
<channel name>', e.g., 'help racetalk'.

Most channels have a history feature.  To see the history on a channel, use
the syntax '<channelname> -h'.  For example, 'gossip -h 10' will show the
last 10 lines on gossip, while 'answer -h' will show all available lines of
history on the question/answer channel.  You can also use the -h feature to
search for text on a channel; for example, 'gossip -h ivar' will search for
all gossip history containing 'ivar'.  Ignored players (see 'help ignore')
will still show up in channel history.  Note that you can either search or
specify a number of lines, but not both.

To search for a number without the MUD interpreting it as a number of
lines, use the syntax "gossip -h '20'" (this shows all gossip history
containing the number 20).

There are some special commands that can be used on channels to do emotes, 
socials and other actions. Using gossip as an example:

   Use a social on a channel       : gossip *smile
                                     gossip *smile ivar
   Use an emote on a channel       : gossip :emotes something
   Use emote to think on a channel : gossip *think this is cool
   Use emote to say on a channel   : gossip *say say is cool too :)
   Use dice on a channel           : gossip *dice 10 5

The following is a list of channels approved for profane language:

   Clantalk*   Curse       Ftalk       Gclan     Gtell       
   Helper      Immtalk     Mchat       Music     Pokerinfo   
   Spouse      Sports      Debate

* Though the channel is flagged for curse socials, clans may have their own
policies regarding profane language.
