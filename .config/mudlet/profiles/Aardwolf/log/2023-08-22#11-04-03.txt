Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
CLAN: At-ten-tion! KumoGami is here to get some training done!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
(Player) Ruo the Elementalist.
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.
There are 185 players on, the most on this reboot was 304.
There are 184 players using compression.

| Dear All
| 
| 
| I had a pleasure to interview Lepdar.
| He's a new player who would like to get help with the game,
| as well to help our clan best to his abilities.
| He completed academy goal and got more than 15 levels.
| He's ok with our policies, r-rated clantalk and culture.
| He has no other alts.
| I'd recommend to bring him in.
| 
| Cheers

| hi! i just figured out how to post a note.
| i like killing creatures
| and occasionally questing.
| i don't like how they're hard to figure out sometimes
| or the hidden rooms are hard to find.
| also, not really sure i like this note system.
| :D
| interesting in joining the boot clan.
| i think you guys can help me learn.
| maybe give me some directions.
| also i could find my corpse if i die.
| :)

| Hello and thank you for your interest in boot! We look forward to getting to
| know you. You have completed the first step in the application process.
| 
| Please read the below instructions carefully.
| 
| Take a day to read over the suggested help files. Feel free to introduce
| yourself to our members and ask questions if you like. Make sure
| you have completed the academy goal.
| 
| After this period  you  will need to contact a Boot Member who is above the
| rank of Corpsman / Medic for a formal interview. Staff members will be posted
| at the bottom of this note if there are any issues. Alternatively, someone
| may contact you for an interview.
| 
| Before your interview you will need to read over the following Aardwolf help
| files:
| 
|  Help Boot
|  Help Newbieclan
|  Help Rules
|  Help Botting
| 
| After your interview you will be inducted into the clan as soon as a General
| is on and someone is available to give you a tour.
| 
| Please note that if you send a member a tell and they do not respond it is most
| likely because they are afk.
| 
| More information about us can be found in claninfo boot
| and on our website: https://aardwolfboot.com

| Nienna, Talbor, and Saraid on Board Personal.

| signed up and one who is outcasted. Its still plenty of time. So...
| Note read 499901 and 500141!

| ATTENTION!
| 
| Now Listen up Booters!  This is your old friend Madrox here with some
| serious business.  Our Grumpy Old General has been out gallivanting
| somewhat close to the wilderness again.  Now as you know the good
| elderly General sometimes gets alil confused about his whereabouts
| then he gets lost.  Yet he always comes back, always making assignments
| that our Booties complete!  Well...let me tell you, he returned
| exhausted and alil angry about all the hostiles he has come across.
| As per such, he has declared war on all the people, animals, and
| the inanimate objects in the lands. He had handed over list after list
| so full of names, I just don't know what to do with it all. So for a
| very few, you will have the chance at a much larger payout than usual.
| Each and every one of you who are not staff will be eligible to

| annihilate them all and get a large bonus to spend when out about
| near Anthrox on a furlow. So soldier, do you have what it takes to
| crush Our Grumpy Old General's enemies? Do you have the fortitude
| held deep within to not stop under any circumstances? Only the best
| ever will have the best chance to win. The General is going to reach
| ever so deep into his pockets for riches you can only imagine.
| So once again, do you have what it takes? Do ya punk?!?!

| 
| Who qualifies for this raffle? 
| 
| Anyone who is not staff or training to be staff, you know who you are.

| Campaigns, and alot of them! In order to get ONE chance, you must
| complete FIFTY....5..0...campaigns. If you do 200, you get 4 chances.
| If you do 100, 2 chances, if you need help with math, ask Epsilon.
| 
| In order to enter, you will have to send me a tell with your current
| campaigns completed. No lying or Saraid will get sad and cry. Once
| you send me a tell, (which you can do right now!) I will jot down
| your name and cps. On August 31st whenever you can, send me a new tell
| with how many you have completed. If you can't make it on that day
| let me know before the 31st if you feel as if you are done CPing.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The dark cave
  Entering the dark cave, an overwhelming feeling of dread and despair fills 
your being. Smells of rotten decay waft up from below with sounds that pierce
your being and make the hairs on your neck stand on end. You wonder if this 
adventure is really worth the rewards after hearing tales in the village 
about an eight-armed skeleton who stole a woman only two days ago. Maybe it 
was just the peasant's imagination working during the excitement of the 
moment. Looking around to make sure it's safe to go down, you notice 
something scrawled on the wall.

A rough hewn passageway of stone
  Dropping down through the hole above you, you find yourself standing in a 
twisting passageway of stone. Red eyes glowing in the darkness gleam at you 
and the shuffling sounds of something moving nearer reaches your ears.
Quickly lighting a torch you hold it up, gasping with fear as you take a step
back as undead move forward. So many of them, so many different kinds, your 
mind races... How can this be that they are all working together like this?
Your question will have to wait...

Unlike normal quests from Questor, you do not "go on" area quests; they are
simply puzzles hidden within areas.  Many of these have different rewards,
including the possibility of special equipment or a portal leading to the 
area.  With very few exceptions, area quests are isolated- everything needed 
is usually in the area with the quest.  Not all areas have an area quest, and
there's no easy way to distinguish which do and which do not until you find 
them. Many area quests have been converted into the more handy goal system 
(see 'help goals').

There are any number of things you may have to do to solve an area quest.
These usually (but not always) include interacting with a mobile in some 
fashion- giving a certain mob gold or equipment, saying something in 
particular, and/or using a social on the mob or to a room.  Clues are often
given in descriptions of rooms, objects, and mobiles, as well as through
listening to mobiles with the 'listen' command.

It is not illegal to give people hints and advice on area quests but we do
ask that you avoid just giving them the entire answer, particularly on
those puzzles that are never needed for normal quests and have special
rewards at the end.  You are encouraged to explore the areas for yourself
and solve the puzzles on your own.  If you are just plain stuck after
trying everything you can think of, feel free to see if anyone on the
question channel feels like giving out some hints.

A rough hewn passageway of stone
  Finally emerging past the rows of caverns, you find yourself still traveling 
through the rough stone passageways. Curving to the east you see a light up 
ahead in what appears to be a much larger cavern. If there is light perhaps 
there is help, or at least maybe no undead to contend with. Maybe the priests
are not the only ones here trying to help.

  A ladder descends through a hole in the floor here; unfortunately it is 
covered by some type of glass dome with a strange lock on it. You nearly jump
out of your boots as a deep hiss comes from a dark corner of the room. You 
leap back and ready your weapons as a sword narrowly whistles past your gut.
Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of 
your life. Your thoughts fade as it comes at you, blades whistling through 
the air...

by some sort of powerful magic enchantment. You wonder what it will take to

was just the peasant's imagination working during the excitement of the 
moment. Looking around to make sure it's safe to go down, you notice

Darkon Stills exclaims, "When I arrived here, I was too late, the cultists
 had already begun sealing themselves deep in the cavern. In a brash
 attempt to detain them, I charged in, but in the struggle I lost my
 blessed cross. I managed to waylay a straggler and steal his key, but I
 daren't go in alone without my holy protection. Find my cross: I will give
 you the key if you prove yourself. These fiends must be stopped!"

Task 1  : Help Darkon find his lost crucifix.

Darkon Stills exclaims, "When I arrived here, I was too late, the cultists
 had already begun sealing themselves deep in the cavern. In a brash
 attempt to detain them, I charge in, but in the struggle I lost my blessed
 cross. I managed to waylay a straggler and steal his key, but I daren't go
 in alone without my holy protection. Find my cross: I will give you the
 key if you prove yourself. These fiends must be stopped!"

A large, lit cavern (G)
  A ladder descends through a hole in the floor here; unfortunately it is 
covered by some type of glass dome with a strange lock on it. You nearly jump
out of your boots as a deep hiss comes from a dark corner of the room. You 
leap back and ready your weapons as a sword narrowly whistles past your gut.
Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of 
your life. Your thoughts fade as it comes at you, blades whistling through 
the air...

  This cavern is eerily quiet. Peering around yourself in the darkness, you 
notice that your light glints off of something on the floor. Stooping down to
inspect the source of the flash, you notice a small trail of some strange wet
substance which appears to be some kind of slime. You howl in pain as the 
stuff starts to burn on your fingers. This is no ordinary slime; it has to be
made of acid!

A cavern
  This cavern seems to be some sort of refuse dump for body parts and personal 
belongings. Apparently there must be someone else around here to use this 
cavern as a waste room; certainly the undead would not care about such 
things. As you wonder about this discovery you sense some movement coming 
from the heaps of rotting flesh and clothing. Bracing yourself, you watch 
cautiously for the source. Suddenly you are showered by clumps of rot as a 
huge bulbous creature emerges, waving two tentacled arms about. It gnashes 
its teeth in a grotesque central maw as its single eye darts back and forth 
seemingly to keep you in its field of vision.

  Moving farther into the stone tunnels, you find yourself standing outside of 
what appears to be more cavern entrances. A high pitched shriek rings out and
the sounds of steel clashing reach your ears. More shouts and curses follow 
the sounds of battle and an elven warrior dressed in gleaming chainmail 
staggers from the west room. He falls to one knee and supports himself on the
hilt of his sword. Blood runs freely from a nasty wound in his side. Looking 
up he motions you closer, "Please I beg of you, HELP THEM!"

  Running into the room, you see a band of elven warriors standing together in 
a tight formation. Shields and swords drawn, they are facing a huge beast.
It appears to be some form of bear, but it has to be undead. Its ribcage 
shows exposed bone gleaming whitely in the torch light, and numerous other 
pieces of it seem to have just fallen off. The elves are obviously 
well-trained, and they move forward in unison attacking the beast 
ferociously, hacking lumps of flesh from its body. It roars in frustration 
and, seemingly unaffected, it charges!

  Moving farther into the stone tunnels, you find yourself standing outside of 
what appears to be more cavern entrances. A high pitched shriek rings out and
the sounds of steel clashing reach your ears. More shouts and curses follow 
the sounds of battle and an elven warrior dressed in gleaming chainmail 
staggers from the west room. He falls to one knee and supports himself on the
hilt of his sword. Blood runs freely from a nasty wound in his side. Looking 
up he motions you closer, "Please I beg of you, HELP THEM!"

Before the door
  Standing before the door you can see faint traces of light coming from around
its edges, and you can just barely make out what sounds like a boiling noise 
coming from inside. Pushing against the door you find it locked. Taking a 
mighty swing with your axe results in a chipped blade. This door is protected
by some sort of powerful magic enchantment. You wonder what it will take to 
break this spell so you can find out what's going on inside...

  Finally emerging past the rows of caverns, you find yourself still traveling 
through the rough stone passageways. Curving to the east you see a light up 
ahead in what appears to be a much larger cavern. If there is light perhaps 
there is help, or at least maybe no undead to contend with. Maybe the priests
are not the only ones here trying to help.

A large, lit cavern (G)
  A ladder descends through a hole in the floor here; unfortunately it is 
covered by some type of glass dome with a strange lock on it. You nearly jump
out of your boots as a deep hiss comes from a dark corner of the room. You 
leap back and ready your weapons as a sword narrowly whistles past your gut.
Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of 
your life. Your thoughts fade as it comes at you, blades whistling through 
the air...

wood and listen intently. Several voices are coming from somewhere ahead; 
they are very faint. If this room were not so quiet, you really doubt you 
would have noticed them at all. Taking advantage of not being discovered yet,
you stop to look around. A strange symbol decorates the east wall.

Altar of sacrifice
  Drawing closer, you see that there is no table here but in fact a bloody 
altar. Several men stand around the altar chanting over the body of a young 
woman who is chained down to it. Holding hands with their eyes closed they 
don't seem to notice you walk up. You can see that their skin is gray and has
a leathery look to it. These are not men- they are undead performing some 
dark ritual! Suddenly the chanting rises in volume until it becomes almost a 
yell. The man in the center, at the head of the altar, suddenly steps forward
and drives his hand into the young woman's chest! The still living girl lets 
out a low moan. As her last breath escapes her, the evil priest pulls her 
still-beating heart out and holds it high. Suddenly seeing you, he screams in
rage, "Kill this fool! No mortal will ever witness such a ceremony and escape
to tell about it!" The undead priests turn on you as he flees north.

Altar of sacrifice
  Drawing closer, you see that there is no table here but in fact a bloody 
altar. Several men stand around the altar chanting over the body of a young 
woman who is chained down to it. Holding hands with their eyes closed they 
don't seem to notice you walk up. You can see that their skin is gray and has
a leathery look to it. These are not men- they are undead performing some 
dark ritual! Suddenly the chanting rises in volume until it becomes almost a 
yell. The man in the center, at the head of the altar, suddenly steps forward
and drives his hand into the young woman's chest! The still living girl lets 
out a low moan. As her last breath escapes her, the evil priest pulls her 
still-beating heart out and holds it high. Suddenly seeing you, he screams in
rage, "Kill this fool! No mortal will ever witness such a ceremony and escape
to tell about it!" The undead priests turn on you as he flees north.

Altar of sacrifice
  Drawing closer, you see that there is no table here but in fact a bloody 
altar. Several men stand around the altar chanting over the body of a young 
woman who is chained down to it. Holding hands with their eyes closed they 
don't seem to notice you walk up. You can see that their skin is gray and has
a leathery look to it. These are not men- they are undead performing some 
dark ritual! Suddenly the chanting rises in volume until it becomes almost a 
yell. The man in the center, at the head of the altar, suddenly steps forward
and drives his hand into the young woman's chest! The still living girl lets 
out a low moan. As her last breath escapes her, the evil priest pulls her 
still-beating heart out and holds it high. Suddenly seeing you, he screams in
rage, "Kill this fool! No mortal will ever witness such a ceremony and escape
to tell about it!" The undead priests turn on you as he flees north.

  This room is huge. It stretches northwards, and you can see several figures 
huddled around what appears to be a table. Bloody barred cells line the east 
wall and there is another wooden door to the west. Dozens of corpses lie 
about this room in various stages. Some are only skeletal, others appear to 
be in various stages of decomposition, while a few appear to have a drained 
look. Odd that they are just lying about stacked like this. Perhaps they are 
just waiting to be enchanted with the force that will give them undead 
life...

Outside a dark cave (G)
  You find yourself standing before a dark and ominous cave. Villagers from the
town told you to look for a middle-aged man named Darkon Stills near the 
entrance to the cave. This must be him, and this must be the cave.

[ Exits: north west ]
     (Hum) A drumstick carved completely of hardwood lies on the nicely refurbished floor.
     (Burnished) A ripped-off piece of tabaxi fur lies here.
     (Enhanced) A Wickedly Sharp Axe lies here.
     (Magic) (Polished) A small badge lies on the floor.
     (Magic) A circular weave of thorns rests here in a pile.
(White Aura) A middle-aged man stands here with a grim look on his face.
Darkon Stills says, "Greetings, KumoGami! We live in a strange and
 terrible world where people can do things like this. Fortunately justice
 is on our side, remain strong, friend."

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Sun Warmed Beach
  The sand of the sun-warmed beach has footprints that lead in various
directions.  Some of the footprints have been filled with water, some washed
away by the waves.  Various sea shells adorn the sand as if they were placed
there by magic, when in reality, the waves left behind some small treasures
for children to find.  The view of the ocean to the south and west is
breathtakingly beautiful.  The salty sea air is filled with the sound of
hungry seagulls and laughing children.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

and soft.  Seashells are scattered about, unfortunately most are broken.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  After ascending a stairway of clouds leading into the heavens, an individual 
would probably expect to find something surreal at the top. Many an explorer 
has been left disappointed, however, since this is nothing more than the 
Ascension Bluff Nursing Home. The architect thought that a stairway of clouds
would make the residents feel closer to the gods. Unfortunately, all this 
served to do was make this location less suitable for visitors and employees 
to frequent. Further to this, when one closely inspects the clouds, they will
come to the realization that they are not real clouds at all, but rather 
millions of tiny cotton balls affixed to a steel frame. Interestingly enough,
it seems that a nursing home in the clouds acquires quite the eclectic bunch 
of residents. Anyone who chances by a for a visit will find that this nursing
home contains more than just your ordinary sampling of senior citizens.

Entrance to Ascension Bluff
  At the entrance to the Ascension Bluff Nursing home the pathway widens into a
semi-circle of flagstones that are surrounded by several stout wooden 
benches. A low-set stone wall hugs all of these particulars, and three wide, 
curved steps lead up to the front entrance of the nursing home. This nursing 
home has been made to look like a lodge in hopes that the residents will feel
like they are simply here on vacation. The roof has a steep slope and the 
exterior of the building has been carefully crafted from wooden logs. Patio 
doors lead straight out to the front gardens and walkway from many locations 
along the front of the building. Even more light is brought into the nursing 
home via expansive, arched windows that take up much of the wall-space above
the patio doors.

The Reception Area (2059)

It looks like a maintenance worker is packing up for the day.
The Reception Area
  In this section of the nursing home, a reception desk has been built to stand
along the northern wall. In order to save some gold, the nursing home 
acquires volunteers to work at this reception desk. Calming music drifts 
forth here from some indiscernible source. It seems to be an unfamiliar 
lullaby that repeats itself in a loop. Now, that might get a tad bit annoying
for an individual who happens to spend a lot of time at this desk, but then 
again, maybe anyone working here would just tune it out after a while. The 
mural painted behind this desk shows an image of trees stretching out their 
branches in order to hold each other. Some sort of high-tech magical visual 
device has been installed near the ceiling in this corner of the room, 
seemingly to scan the entryway for unwanted guests.

The Reception Area
  The architectural team for this nursing home pondered the fact that in the 
beginning, these types of facilities started out as extensions to hospitals.
Therefore, to a certain extent, folks expect that a nursing home will retain 
that appearance. The team also recognized that the building's entrance is 
incredibly important in giving visitors that positive first impression of 
what the overall facility will be like. So the designer team worked hard to 
create a spacious, colorful, and inviting entrance. They wanted to imbue an 
overwhelming feeling of happiness within the individual as they took their 
first steps into the building. To do this, they utilized a palette of warm 
color tones for several large wall murals, as well as floors crafted with a 
tile mosaic finish. They added comfortable furniture to relax in, and spared 
no expense on an extravagant, cathedral ceiling, made perfect with the 
addition of incredible skylights.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door

slaves being whipped.  The smell of sweat and perspiration is sickly sweet
to your nose, and tangy to your taste.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  This shadowy path, no doubt created by some dark force, seems even darker
than the cold emptiness of space.  The shadows form a loop, almost like a
leash around the stars, encircling Jabbah entirely while stretching out east
to Novus Ordo, back west around Polaris, and south, just shy of Xathanc,
before completing the loop.  Polaris is just west of here, while Jabbah is
off to the southeast.  Azah and Tyl can be seen together in the northwest,
across the Fundamental Celestial Plane.

itself.  Animal skulls are common.  Cracked, and worn by the harsh winds
that pass through this area, they take on macabre and menacing countenances.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Murky Water (2107)

A Small Underground Stream
  The stream here is a tunnel, the rock sides rugged and close.  The roof
is getting lower, too, though it is dotted with air pockets and shallow,
natural caves.  Kelp and streamweed grow closely together in the streambed,
and bunches of eggs hide among them.  Schools of minnows practice swimming
down and upstream, learning to use their tails and fins like their parents. 
Apparently, continuing downstream will eventually take you to a river.

  Apart from the torches on the walls, this cave would be dark and lonely. 
Even the flickering light of the torches is barely enough to see; darkness
remains, cowering in hollows and corners, hiding from the light.  This
immense cavern seems to be completely natural, having no signs of carving or
any other irregular abrasions.  The high roof seems to close in to the
north, gradually becoming more of a tunnel - though at its lowest, a
nicely-grown centaur could still stand comfortably without touching...  If
ever a centaur would venture down into this darkness.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

  Walking into this room is almost terrifying.  Trophies, most with an
agonizing or ferocious look about them, fill the room: a tiger is reared up
on his hind legs looking to strike its foe with an outstretched paw; several
lions are poised to attack; and many other animals, the likes of which you
have never seen, are spread throughout.

  This portion of the road is especially well adorned.  The oil lanterns
around the doorways are made of gold, and intricate murals decorate the
walls.  To the south, gold-laden double doors are guarded to prevent easy
entry into the Governor's Palaestra.  People, awaiting the next theatre
performance, gather around the entrance to the north.

Sarno Road
  This portion of the road is especially well adorned.  The oil lanterns
around the doorways are made of gold, and intricate murals decorate the
walls.  To the south, gold-laden double doors are guarded to prevent easy
entry into the Governor's Palaestra.  People, awaiting the next theatre
performance, gather around the entrance to the north.

Actors' Guild
  Two actors stand in the center of the room practicing their lines,
making grand motions to emphasize their words, and arguing over how a piece
should be played.  Grumbling to himself, a man searches through wardrobes
for something to wear during his next performance.  Behind the scenes is far
less attractive than the finished product; maybe it's time to go back to the
theatre.

able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling

you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can

it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Abig answers 'btw, there is a mob with bow etc. You need to think about your approach'

wake
You wake up on Medical beds, then stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     (Magic) A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     (Magic) Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

making grand motions to emphasize their words, and arguing over how a piece
should be played.  Grumbling to himself, a man searches through wardrobes
for something to wear during his next performance.  Behind the scenes is far
less attractive than the finished product; maybe it's time to go back to the

Great Pyramids of Giza
  You see before you a great stone structure, approximately 481 feet in
height.  Surrounded by corridors and shafts no matter which way you turn,
you must decide which way to go to reach the center.  This appears to be
more dangerous than your typical tour.  But then you knew this was not going
to be one anyway.

Museum of Wonders
  You enter into a museum unlike any other, as you are literally swept away
with the realism of your surroundings.  Your eyes begin to glaze over and
you have to fight to regain your bearings.  This is not real and these
places no longer exist.  These are merely replicas...  Or are they?

holds a sceptre inlaid with every kind of metal, with an eagle perched on
the sceptre.  His sandals are made of gold, as is his robe.  His garments
are carved with the animals and with lilies.  The throne is decorated with

  You walk into a large room with placards placed along the walls.  You see
etchings, a case filled with small bits of stone, miniature statues.  You
walk up closer and read one of the placards.  Wonder Fact: In Greek
mythology Zeus was the god of the sky.  He was the rain god, a cloud
gatherer.  He wields a mighty thunderbolt.  He is represented as the god of
justice and mercy, protector of the weak, punisher of the evil.  He was
married to Hera who was also his sister and was father to many children. 
His son Ares was god of war, Hebe the goddess of youth, Hephaestus the god
of fire, and Eilethyia the goddess of childbirth.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A small camp (G)
  The disillusioned looks of the people camping here show things have been
rough for them for a very long time.  Only one tent remains standing,
barely.  The fire seems dim, even for one so small.  As you look more
closely you wonder what they've had to resort to using as fuel.  A few
mining tools stick out of the ground near one wounded man, who's propped up
against a stack of barrels.  

[ Exits: east ]
     A big stack of powder kegs sits here, there's a sign on it.
     A small campfire burns merrily away here.
     A tattered tent barely stands up in the breeze.
(Golden Aura) This weary soul stares into the distance, in shock from what they've seen.
(Red Aura) An undead miner is here chewing on part of a dead miner.

A wounded miner says, "My poor tools, left on those mountains. The stone
 is much too hard for them to do much good. Only way to move that rock is
 to blast..."

A huge crater
  You stumble into this huge blackened crater, and wonder what could
possibly have done this.  It's large enough to make camp in, and the ground
is still hot to the touch.  As you look around the crater you see a charred
body laying half buried in the scorched soil.  Looking up, you see smoke
rising to the west.  

[ Exits: east south west ]
     A charred body slowly sinks into the ground.
(Red Aura) The corpse of one of the miners is shambling about evilly.

  As you look around, you wonder if this is any better then the tunnels. 
The ground is twisted and broken, a plain filled with death.  Bones litter
the surface, hundreds of creatures must've died here.  The sky fills you
with unease as it casts an eerie array of colors around you.  You decide to
keep your eyes down since watching the clouds above you boil fills you with
nausea.

>>    *[NOEXP]* At the foot of the mountains
  Monstrous black mountains rise before you, reaching through the clouds
above.  Lightning flashes from deep within the clouds, and peals of thunder
threaten to rattle your teeth out of your jaw.  Through the thunder you
think you can hear other sounds, furious roars and blood curdling shrieks. 
You can see a path of sorts leading up the mountain to the west.

  This could only be called a path because it's possible to climb it, and

the black stone you begin to wonder if it would be easier to simply go back
and try to find another way to the top.  After scrambling over a ledge, you
find a huge pile of boulders blocking your path.  Looks like the decision
has been made.

  With the boulders out of the way you can make out a path to the top of
the mountain.  The path climbs steeply, winding its way up a near vertical
slope.  Jagged formations of black rock jut out at all angles, making the
relatively simple task of finding a handhold extremely treacherous.  One
wrong move could slice your hand open, or worse.

A rough trail
  The path let out onto a broader trail, but you can't see where it leads. 
The clouds are so thick they block your vision past a few feet.  With a
little work, you manage to determine the trail leads east and west, but
where it ends up is a mystery.  As you search around the area you begin to
wonder if you'd notice a cliff until it was too late.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The ground is twisted and broken, a plain filled with death.  Bones litter
the surface, hundreds of creatures must've died here.  The sky fills you
with unease as it casts an eerie array of colors around you.  You decide to
keep your eyes down since watching the clouds above you boil fills you with
nausea.

  This could only be called a path because it's possible to climb it, and
slightly safer then the razor sharp edges around it.  As you struggle over

find a huge pile of boulders blocking your path.  Looks like the decision

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

You notice the grey moon falling to the west.

can often sell lvl 1 aard items for a decent chunk of what you paid for them'

Neeper Tech: that's quite an old plugin, there is a similar issue on its github that suggests
checking you have a %c on the end of your prompt for a new line so it triggers/catches correctly?

Neclord Tech: Checking.

Reyn answers 'no - they are noreown'

Neclord Tech: actually

Neeper Tech: (you can see your prompt in "auto" if you didn't know)

Neclord Tech: is there a newer plugin that I could/should be using, rather than xeqDB?

Sath Tech: you could edit phelpobject.lua at line 205 and check if the object is nil before saving
it

Sath Tech: no

Tech: You notice that Neclord is extremely depressed.

Neeper Tech: then you can probably remove xeqdb :)

Sath Tech: this appears to be a Bast plugin

Sath Tech: dinv is by durel and has no dependencies

Neclord Tech: So I could probably just remove it and be fine with dinv, right?

Neclord Tech: hehe

Neclord Tech: well alrighty then

Neeper Tech: or at least disable it to check it has no other affect on your setup

Neclord Tech: I'm glad I asked 

Neclord Tech: good call. I'll try that out. 

Neclord Tech: Thank you!

Misty Border
  The road you have been walking on has become clouded up ahead. A thick 
choking fog has descended and envelops it and you as well. The air is 
choking heavy with the moisture and a sickeningly sweet smell. You can't 
quite place your finger on it. As you turn your head to look about, you find 
that the way back has become obscured. The only things you can make out 
clearly are the road under your feet and the soft glow of the light above
you...

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

what.  To the west, loud clanks and pounding noises ring out from a small

  A small stairway stands before you.  Screams of the tortured souls ring
out from the eerie stairway.  You ponder if you should go down or not,
wondering if the screams you hear are the souls of dead adventurers that had
intruded.  As you stand pondering, a wind blows by and sends a deep chill
down your spine; you are momentarily paralyzed, but quickly recover.  You
sense something sinister in this evil place, but you aren't sure exactly
what.  To the west, loud clanks and pounding noises ring out from a small
building.  And to the east is a quiet, medium-sized hut.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.

  The Museum of Wonders is a very large place.  It is extremely easy to get
lost or separated from your group if you're unable to find your way back to
an exit on your own.  Maybe you just want to get away from the crowds and
clear your head.  This is the only room in the whole building you know is
real, as you know exactly where you are.

Room of Facts
  You walk into a large room with placards placed along the walls.  You see
etchings, a case filled with small bits of stone, miniature statues.  You
walk up closer and read one of the placards.  Wonder Fact: In Greek
mythology Zeus was the god of the sky.  He was the rain god, a cloud
gatherer.  He wields a mighty thunderbolt.  He is represented as the god of
justice and mercy, protector of the weak, punisher of the evil.  He was
married to Hera who was also his sister and was father to many children. 
His son Ares was god of war, Hebe the goddess of youth, Hephaestus the god
of fire, and Eilethyia the goddess of childbirth.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

Near an Old Logging Road
  A short distance from the old logging road, you see what appears to be 
a small city wall.  An odd shiver suddenly runs up your spine as you 
peer into the distance.  Something... is not right.

  You continue to wander, noticing the remains of what appear to have been

would make the residents feel closer to the gods. Unfortunately, all this 
served to do was make this location less suitable for visitors and employees 
to frequent. Further to this, when one closely inspects the clouds, they will
come to the realization that they are not real clouds at all, but rather 
millions of tiny cotton balls affixed to a steel frame. Interestingly enough,
it seems that a nursing home in the clouds acquires quite the eclectic bunch 
of residents. Anyone who chances by a for a visit will find that this nursing
home contains more than just your ordinary sampling of senior citizens.

Entrance to Ascension Bluff
  At the entrance to the Ascension Bluff Nursing home the pathway widens into a
semi-circle of flagstones that are surrounded by several stout wooden 
benches. A low-set stone wall hugs all of these particulars, and three wide, 
curved steps lead up to the front entrance of the nursing home. This nursing 
home has been made to look like a lodge in hopes that the residents will feel
like they are simply here on vacation. The roof has a steep slope and the 
exterior of the building has been carefully crafted from wooden logs. Patio 
doors lead straight out to the front gardens and walkway from many locations 
along the front of the building. Even more light is brought into the nursing 
home via expansive, arched windows that take up much of the wall-space above
the patio doors.

  Here is a bar where visitors can serve themselves tea or a cup of coffee (of 
the decaffeinated variety, unfortunately). There is no one here to serve the 
drinks, but a fundraising jar has been placed on the bar so that those who 
partake in a beverage can place a gold coin inside. To the west and south are
rooms that house nursing home residents. Each door has had its occupant's

  Big Harold's room is quite simple and masculine. He has brought in a large

stands between them. The coffee table has many drawers in it, so it's quite 
possible he is hiding some of his favorite tasty snacks in there! Harold 
definitely has a love for all foods that are sweet. Every resident gets a 
basic room that comes with a bed supplied by the nursing home. They are 
encouraged to furnish the room further in order to add their own personal 
touch. Each resident room has tongue and groove boards an inch thick, 
installed vertically for the walls, and thicker boards for the floor and 
roof.

  It is nice and warm in here. This is mainly because the room is heated by a 
series of pipes that pump hot water through it, but also because there is a 
bathtub in the corner that is filled with hot bath water. One of the reasons 
that this nursing home has such a great reputation is due to its modern way 
of utilizing a plumbing system in order to provide fresh water for the 
patients. The other residents share a common bathing chamber, but Harold was 
given a special bath all of his own since hydrotherapy was deemed a necessity
in order to help treat his arthritic pains.

The Goat Skull Gate (G) [**> PK <**]
  There is a large iron gate here, with a short elf guarding it.  The gate
is going north into a mountain. There appears to be a cave north of here,
but you can't see through the gate very well.  There are many different
rocks embedded in the mountain.  It almost seems that they form a pattern.
You can hear the dripping of water from inside the caves.
There is also a cold draft of air hitting you.  Perhaps this is the
entrance to the legendary Dark Elf Fortress?

Smaug's Cave (G)
  This huge cave once belonged to the great dragon Smaug, but when the dark
elfs killed Smaug they made this to a large guard cave, animated the corpse
of Smaug and placed him here to guard the fortress.  The smell of death
makes you feel sick.  

[ Exits: south (up) ]

The Invaded Caves (2116)

Searching the Halls
  This room smells of fresh blood taken from dark elves.  The dwarves
appear to be looking for the device that will transport them to the rest of
the caves.  The walls do not drip of water now but of a mixture of water and
dirt.  A drop falls on your head and clanks against your helmet.  You
wonder whether you should help the dwarves find the portal...  You can look
east or west of here.  

[ Exits: east west ]
     (Invis) (Magic) A swirling maelstrom that leads somewhere ravages the area here.

Portal Landing
  This part of the fortress is cold.  It gives you a chill being here, and
you wish you were home.  There are maps on the walls with X's on them. 
Perhaps the X marks their next point of attack?  The invading dwarves
obviously have not come through these parts yet, not one kind soul lurks
about, except for the captured slaves.  The caves get wider and larger to
the east and to the west they seem to be more confining.

Intersection Cave
  A cleared and empty intersection.  To the south you can see the treasury
cave.  To the north lies a storage room for food and east you can see a
door.  A sign on the door reads: 'Knock before you enter!'.  Arguing can
be heard from the door.  You wonder what is so important for the inhabitants
of the room to be yelling so loudly.

Cave Garden Entrance
  You are at the beginning of a garden, the only source of food for the
dark elves, except for the meats the drow bring back from their hunting
parties.  You would not expect food to grow here, for there is no sunlight,
which would explain why some of the plants are white instead of green. 
Several small streams flow southward.  It is very humid in here, and you can
feel the perspiration forming on your back.  The garden continues south.  

[ Exits: south ]
(Red Aura) A large gardener awaits your death here.
(Red Aura) An ugly gardener glares at you.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

The Pass
  At the southwestern edge of the Halo Mountains lies the entrance to Dusk 
Valley.  The pass is fifteen feet wide and half a mile long.  Cliffs on both 
sides shoot up hundreds of feet.  The wind at the entrance of the pass screams 
through.  Small boulders and rocks continuously fall from above and explode 
upon impacting the ground.  The ground is made up of rock, dust, sand, and 
crushed up bones.  Near the end the pass where the cliffs end the ground 
transitions to a rich farmable soil.

Into the Dusk
  The cliffs of the Halo Mountains suddenly end at the edge of Dusk Valley.  
Stories tell of ancient arcane battles within these lands.  The rich, farmable 
soil along the road is damp and contains many varieties of bones from many 
different animals and races.  There is a fine steamy mist throughout the valley 
that dims out the sun during the day.  Shadows move about the mist and there 
are low moans in the distance.  The main road that runs north and south 
through the valley is perfectly constructed with glowing slate in an archaic 
printbone pattern.  Along the outside of the road many radiant globes float 
motionless above.

and the moist, rich soil.  Spherical objects magically appear and disappear 
through the steamy mist.  Cloaked Eldars move about on and off the road.  Their 
faces are hidden and unrecognizable except for their eyes and most of them 
carry staves made of bones.

The Pull
  
The dirt road runs north and east. A strong energy pulls everything toward
the east. Giant boulders roll across the road. Vegetation is sucked out of 
the ground and a dust storm is created from the materials of the dirt road.
Light from the sky is dimmed from the amount of debris in the atmosphere 
caused by the energy.

  The Bridge of Bones runs north and south and each step that you take
swings the bridge side to side.  The hand grips made of rope are meant to 
help provide tension and to keep the traveler safe.  Almost all of the bones

falls into the bottomless pit.  Sounds of crumbling and breaking rocks come

  The bridge makes a gradual turn and runs south and west.  Most of the long 
ropes are still intact but a large number of bones have completely come loose 
and fallen down into the hole.  There is very little to walk on except for a 
few tiny bones attached to thin pieces of rope.  Some of the shorter pieces 
of rope hang down below the bridge gripping large pieces of bone.  The bones 
blow up sideways from the fierce winds.

Along the outside of the road many radiant globes float motionless

  The lobby of The Golden Egg is known for its comfort and hospitality.  The
Golden Egg stands as the only inn throughout the entire Dusk Valley.  The
room is filled with vibrant colors from floor to ceiling.  Famous Eldar
leaders are immortalized in paintings that hang on the wall just above
handsome inscriptions bearing their names.  The frames of the portraits 
are handcrafted and decorated with gold inlay.  Leather couches and
recliners are arranged around a fireplace on the west wall near a small
library.  A display table has been set up with a full buffet in the
southwest corner.  The owner stands behind the check-in counter which also
happens to be a full bar.  You can just see the owner's eyes within the

  The well-used dirt road travels east and west, and grassy fields lie to 
the north and south.  The road has been widened to provide a walkway for an 
army.  The layers of dust cover the road and leave deep footprints.  
Cloaked Eldars pass by continuously in groups and speak the ancient Eldar 
dialect.  Light is very good here even at night.  There is no valley mist 
or haze, and the humidity is minimal.  The baggy cloaks worn by the Eldars 
are kept on their bodies by leather belts and straps.  Coin bags hang from 
their waist, and most of the Eldars carry tall staves designed from bones.  
Somehow the bones have been wrapped around each other to make a single staff.

Entry Foyer
  This room has a pleasant, clean atmosphere.  The carpet is lush and
thick, soothing to weary feet.  Once, perfect nature murals covered the
walls, but now they are singed in spots and their beauty is marred.  Flowers
are dotted about the room, preserved by the unconquerable magic deep within
the foundations...

High-Security Area
  This area is very secure.  To the east, south, and north are solid wooden
doors with one tiny, barred window in each.  Beside the western door to the
hallway is a seat carved into the stone: no doubt a place of rest for the
Nispeung on duty, but a thin layer of dust rests on it, betraying the fact
that it has not been used in some time.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

  Coming out of the throne room, the hall stops at a spiral staircase going
up.  You are not sure where these stairs would lead you to.  Maybe to the
Queen's Bedroom, so perhaps you should check it out.

To the east and west you see hallways leading to other places in the castle.
Perhaps one of them will go to Elena's room.  Standing next to the queen is
Devlin, the queen's bodyguard.  He has sworn to protect her and her family

  Upon entering the throne room you see the ceiling raise to the height of
about hundred twenty feet.  Along the walls more works of art reside. 
Looking further through the hall you discover three thrones standing against
the far wall.  Above the middle throne, which is slightly larger then the
other two, you see a large stain glass window.  The light appearing from the
window, is strong enough to reach the distance of your feet.
