the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

help daily blessing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : 'Daily Blessing' Daily.
Help Category : Features.
Last Updated  : 2018-02-06 17:49:24.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:  daily blessing      : Request your daily blessing.
         daily               : Shows blessing rewards and timers.
         daily prompt        : Toggles 'blessing available' notification.
         daily reset         : Use a daily blessing reset if you have one.

Once per day, a player may look to his/her deity for a favor.  These favors
can manifest in many different forms.  Many times, these bonuses are
applied towards upcoming adventures, but there are rumors of rare gifts and
special enchantments as well.

Once every 23 hours of real time, 'daily blessing' will grant your daily 
blessing.  

Typing 'daily' after you have received your blessing will show any timers
on any blessings and the next time you can request a blessing.  After your
first blessing, a reminder will appear before your prompt when a blessing 
is again available; this may be toggled on and off with 'daily prompt'.

When you request a daily blessing, you will always receive some number of
double experience mobs and at least one double qp quest. Getting the 
experience blessing does not reduce your chances of getting any other 
blessing, so you will still receive it even with noexp on. This gives you 
the option to resume leveling and still get the benefit of your daily 
blessing bonus kills.

Daily Blessing Farming
Daily blessing was added as a gift- something fun to look forward to and
a reason to log in.  Some players are abusing this feature with multiple
alts that do nothing but log in each day to get the daily blessing, hoping
to trigger double exp or other blessings that can benefit their main
character.

If you have multiple characters that login each day and get their daily
blessing without ever actually _using_ the blessing (their double quests,
exp mobs, etc) you are likely to find all your characters flagged and
will receive nothing in your daily blessing but double exp mobs, ever.  
Transferring items across characters (blessing rewards or anything else) 
is multiplaying ('help multiplaying') and is illegal, and will be 
dealt with even more harshly.

Please do not abuse this feature - just use it in the spirit in which
it was intended.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

In a Misty Swamp
  Standing knee-deep in the murkish water, you feel the curious sensation
of unseen creatures slithering against you.  The soft ripples trailing
across the water are rythmically entrancing, but you blink back to reality
when you see the reptilian creature which forms the ripples.  With a shiver,
you move on, wanting to be out of the mist-laden swamp.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

Little is known of the Ethereal race that roams Aardwolf, hence they
are collectively known as 'shadows'. Since their ethereal form makes them
particularly weak when matched against other races their constitution is
limited. Although shadows are more naturally suited to pure spellcasting
classes, their ability to pass all non-warded doors and their low utilization
of energy while exploring makes them very competent thieves. They have an
innate resistance to shadow and vulnerability to light, but air attacks are
also effective against them.

Help Keywords : Wishes Wish.
Help Category : Features.

Syntax: wish               : Lists your current wishes.

        wish list          : Lists all wishes and adjustment costs.
        wish for <keyword> : At Vira, buys the wish w/ given keyword.

Wishes are special abilities for experienced Aardwolf players and are very 
much considered luxury items - this is reflected in their cost. 

Wishes are obtained with quest points and each wish has two costs- a base
cost for that wish and an 'adjustment' cost.  When you buy a wish, the
adjustment cost of every wish you already have is totaled and added to the
base cost of that new wish.  For example, if three wishes cost 5000 quest
points each and have an adjustment of 1000, then the first will cost you
5000, the second will cost you 6000, and the third will cost you 7000.  As
a player gets more wishes and their advantage from wishes grows, so will
the costs.  If a wish is ever removed from the game, the cost of the wish
itself will be reimbursed to those who bought it; however, adjustment
costs will not be returned.  This is the price paid for making use of the
wish while it was still available.

You must be at Vira (located up from the pulpit in the church of Aylor) to
'wish for' any wish.  The other wish commands may be used anywhere.  Wishes
are saved over remorts and tiers. They are NOT saved over a recreate- see
'help multiplaying' for an explanation.

The following wishes are available:


Auctioneer: You will be able to auction 3 items at a time on regular 
auction instead of a single item.

Bravery:  You will not flee the scene when mobs spook or intimidate you.
This does not affect things such as 'mob force' fleeing, etc.

Duration:  The 'duration' wish increases the length of most spellup spells
(whether cast by yourself, from others, or quaffed from potions) by 50%. 
Spells with timed recoveries and the special imm spells are not affected
by this wish.

Exprate:  Increases experience from kills by 10%. Numbers are rounded up,
but you have to gain at least 10xp to get any bonus from this. You can turn
on/off the display of bonus experience using the 'exprate' command. People
with the exprate wish can see the current setting in 'config all'.

Fasthunt:  When you are hunting victims out in the wild, you will take less
time to recover before being able to hunt again.

Gills:  You are always able to breathe underwater, and able to navigate
through water without flight or a boat.

Identify:  This wish displays full object details when using the 
'identify' command, similar to using the command at Hester's. Identify
wish has no lag, can be used during combat, and applies also to the
auction system's identify.

Nightvision:  This wish sets a permanent 'night vision' flag on your 
character, but is not a 'see all' wish.  Please see 'help nightvision' 
before buying this wish.  You may toggle this wish on and off with the 
'nonightvision' command (see 'help nonightvision'). 

Nodirt:  This wish makes you completely immune to the blindess resulting
from dirt kick.  Other skills and spells that cause blindness are NOT
covered.  This wish does work in PVP.

Nohunger:  Hunger/thirst are set to 50 (high enough to not suffer negative
effects of starvation).  You can still eat or drink, but hunger and thirst
levels will not change.  Players which had the 'quest buy nohunger' option
now have this wish instead, and there is no adjustment cost.

Nomarbu:  This wish prevents the blinding affect of burnt marbu and marbu
jet from working on you.  You will still be damaged, but will be unable to
be blinded (via these skills only).  This wish does work in PVP.

Noteleport:  Other characters and monsters will not be able to teleport
you away from combat.  You may still cast teleport on yourself.

Novorpal:  This wish makes you immune to the vorpal effect on weapons.
The weapons will still do damage, but will not decapitate you.

Noweb:  Monsters will not be able to use the web spell on you.  This
wish is not effective in player-vs-player combat. A small number of mobs 
will force you to cast web on yourself, this wish does not resist that.

Passdoor:  Treats your character as if you always have the 'pass door'
affect.  You may still cast the spell, but it has no additional bonus.  You
can toggle this wish by using the command 'nopassdoor', which will show in
'config' after the wish is purchased.

Pockets:  Allows you to carry an extra 100 items above your normal 
limit (based on level and strength).  Also see 'help vault' for an
alternative to pockets.

Pockets2-6:  Allows you to carry an additional 100 extra items, regardless
of stats and level.  Each must be bought in order and stacks on top of the
previous wish(es).

Popularity:  Increases maximum number of friend slots by 40.

Portal:  This wish gives access to an additional equipment slot for items 
of type 'portal'.  There are two benefits to this wish- the convenience of
not having to keep removing your second weapon to enter a portal, and the
stat bonus from any portals with bonus stats. Portal level limits still
apply and you cannot wear a portal of higher level than you + tier bonus.

Privacy:  When people look at you, they will not be able to see what you
are wearing.  This wish is most useful for rangers that want to wear a
dress without getting stereotyped.  Thieves with the 'peek' skill may still
be able to see what you are carrying.  You can toggle the effects of this
wish with 'noprivacy', which will appear in 'config all' when this wish 
is purchased.

Rebuild:  Adds a free rebuild to your character- see 'help rebuild'.
There is no adjustment cost applied to/from this purchase; it is always 2000
quest points, and may be purchased multiple times if desired.

Scholar: Allows you to practice skills up to 95% rather than 85%.

Showscry:  This wish will identify who cast a scry spell ('help scry') on
you, rather than just a vague feeling you are being watched.  The caster is
not informed that you have this wish.

Spellup:  This wish allows you to cast spellup spells in half the time it
would usually take. A spellup spell is defined as those spells that are
listed under 'spells spellup'.

Spellup2:  Reduces the casting time on spellup skills (not spells), and
reduces the lag penalty on failed spellup spell casts.  You must purchase
the 'spellup1' wish before purchasing 'spellup2'.

Statcost:  Allows you to set a -1 stat cost reduction in the stat of 
your choice each remort/rebuild.  This works in the same way as tierstat, 
and can be used in any stat regardless of tierstats.  See 'help wishstats' 
for instructions on using this wish. 

Uncurse:  This wish allows you to use the 'uncurse' command to remove the 
nodrop/noremove flags from all carried and worn items at once.  Items which
are inside a container will not be uncursed.  This wish has no effect on a
curse spell cast upon you.

Weapons:  You are treated as having 100% skill in every weapon type 
excluding hammer, regardless of your class(es)' ability to use them.  If
you do have the weapon skill, it will provide the experience bonus as it
increases with use, though for purposes of combat, you already have 100%
skill.

Premise:
Some high level spellcasters can gain the ability to unlock doors by
the command of their mind. It has been rumoured that even doors
which are physically protected from picking can be unlocked by the
power of this magic. The drawback to this spell is that it is 
completely ineffective when used on doors that are magically warded.

Valkur's Meeting Chamber
  This is the meeting chamber of the Mighty DemonLord, Valkur.  Dominating
the centre of this imposing chamber is a HUGE stone table, fashioned from
the very bones of the Earth.  Black marble has been carved into a sinuous,
circular shape that does odd things to your vision as you try to follow the
contours.  Flecks of red, the colour of blood are speckled throughout the
surface.  Near one wall, a huge bronze gong rests, doubtless used to bring
the meetings to order.  Around the table, chairs carved from the bones of
the slain wait to seat the demonic hosts..

  This room is filled with odd pictures.  As you look at them, the
paintings themselves seem to swirl and coalesce, coming to life before you
on the canvas.  Surrounding each one of them is a faint, red aura, and you
sense that it would not be wise to touch them.  As the pigments twist and
turn, a feeling of nausea creeps into your stomach, staying in this room is

  This part of the castle seems to be subtly different.  The architecture
has taken on a much more functional look, not the gothic, spires and arches
of before, but something altogether more practical.  Black marble has given
way to slate grey stone, closely cobbled within the walls.  Weapons also
adorn the walls, looking well looked after and very sharp.

  Dread magics have warped and twisted the stone, shaping the slabs into
horrific monuments to deities worshipped as gods by these foul creatures. 
It appears that no form is too corrupt, no evil too twisted for these vile
abominations to use it to their own ends.  All about you, soldiers practice
with their weapons, paying you little heed, focused as they are on hacking
apart practice dummies.  Dummies which bear a striking resemblance to people
you have known...

  Huge black wrought iron gates dominate your vision.  Metal, blackened
from the forge is twisted by the rulers of this place into the mocking
parody of a scream.  Swirling scrollwork upon the gates, tells of the
battles and victories of Vlad Shamir.  For a second, you can't believe your
eyes, but you look back, and yes, there it is, 'Aylor'...

Valkur's Meeting Chamber
  This is the meeting chamber of the Mighty DemonLord, Valkur.  Dominating
the centre of this imposing chamber is a HUGE stone table, fashioned from
the very bones of the Earth.  Black marble has been carved into a sinuous,
circular shape that does odd things to your vision as you try to follow the
contours.  Flecks of red, the colour of blood are speckled throughout the
surface.  Near one wall, a huge bronze gong rests, doubtless used to bring
the meetings to order.  Around the table, chairs carved from the bones of
the slain wait to seat the demonic hosts..

The Room of Portals
  This room is filled with odd pictures.  As you look at them, the
paintings themselves seem to swirl and coalesce, coming to life before you
on the canvas.  Surrounding each one of them is a faint, red aura, and you
sense that it would not be wise to touch them.  As the pigments twist and
turn, a feeling of nausea creeps into your stomach, staying in this room is
a little uncomfortable...

  The black flagged stairway continues here, striking up towards the
faintest crack of light far above, and downwards, into the ever present
darkness.  Faint red mist swirls in the air, the smell of vitae and blood
within it, as if the very air in this place were to sap the will to carry
on...

Stone Stairway Leading Upwards
  You pull your cloak closer around yourself, as the cold air finds a way
to worm its way in, and caress with icicles, your tender flesh..  Shadows
around you flee at the arrival of the light that you bear, but as you pass,
again they return, fleetingly, to dance from the dark corners, into the
shadows of the mind..

Valkur's Meeting Chamber
  This is the meeting chamber of the Mighty DemonLord, Valkur.  Dominating
the centre of this imposing chamber is a HUGE stone table, fashioned from
the very bones of the Earth.  Black marble has been carved into a sinuous,
circular shape that does odd things to your vision as you try to follow the
contours.  Flecks of red, the colour of blood are speckled throughout the
surface.  Near one wall, a huge bronze gong rests, doubtless used to bring
the meetings to order.  Around the table, chairs carved from the bones of
the slain wait to seat the demonic hosts..

Countless works of art lay scattered, carelessly around the room.  Work by

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

Welcome to Grandmarket Boulevard! (G)
  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

Stone Stairway Leading Upwards
  The stairway continues underfoot, leading off into the darkness.  A
faint, off-key melody is heard, the sound of which sets your teeth on edge. 
The scraping of your boots against the marble is muffled as if by the
pressure of the walls that rise around you.  

[ Exits: south up down ]
(Red Aura) A horrible demon stands here guarding the portal.

Stone Stairway Leading Upwards
  You pull your cloak closer around yourself, as the cold air finds a way
to worm its way in, and caress with icicles, your tender flesh..  Shadows
around you flee at the arrival of the light that you bear, but as you pass,
again they return, fleetingly, to dance from the dark corners, into the
shadows of the mind..

  The black flagged stairway continues here, striking up towards the
faintest crack of light far above, and downwards, into the ever present
darkness.  Faint red mist swirls in the air, the smell of vitae and blood
within it, as if the very air in this place were to sap the will to carry
on...

Valkur's Meeting Chamber
  This is the meeting chamber of the Mighty DemonLord, Valkur.  Dominating
the centre of this imposing chamber is a HUGE stone table, fashioned from
the very bones of the Earth.  Black marble has been carved into a sinuous,
circular shape that does odd things to your vision as you try to follow the
contours.  Flecks of red, the colour of blood are speckled throughout the
surface.  Near one wall, a huge bronze gong rests, doubtless used to bring
the meetings to order.  Around the table, chairs carved from the bones of
the slain wait to seat the demonic hosts..

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

     The hacked and slashed corpse of KumoGami is rotting here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

  The grey walls close in around you, stirring strong feelings of

On the Floor of the Arena
  The black, coarse sand of the Arena floor is soaked in places, by the
blood of the fallen.  Every now and again, you see bones, of the dead,
picked clean by the beaks of the ever present carrion birds..  As you look
up, the sky appears dark, it is as if rain clouds are coming, a storm is
gathering, but even as you look, you know that no downpour of rain could
wash away this corruption...  

[ Exits: north east south up ]
(Red Aura) An ugly demon berserker is here beating its head against its shield.

On the Floor of the Arena
  The greedy ground has tasted blood.  You sense around you, the anguished
screams of the fallen, those that have died to bring some kind of fleeting
pleasure to the dire masters of this place.  Carrion birds, disturbed by
your approach, propel themselves skywards in a black cloud of scrawly
feathers.  The black sand continues on, the Arena awaiting its next victim.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

In front of Diamond Castle
  Doric columns of pure diamond support this magnificent castle.  Beams of
light encircle the dwelling, illuminating the crystal with an holy
brilliance and a divine majesty.  You slowly raise your hand up to feel the
outer wall, and despite having been exposed to the elements, it is as soft
and tender as a baby's skin, while still having an untold of inner
resilience.  You bow your head in respect for the castle, and notice a
welcome mat on the ground.  The mat is completely lavish as well, having
been woven with intertwined strands of gold and silver.  If the exterior is
any indication, the beauty and grace to be found within will surpass any
you have seen.

  After opening the diamond gate and entering the castle, your senses are
overcome with amazement and wonder.  Even the inner walls of this
magnificent castle are made of diamond.  As you step across the floor, the
shock of your feet smacking the ground is absorbed, and instead of making a
cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which
separates the rest of the castle from the arborium, and to the south is the
castle dining room.  The castle hallway continues east.

  Patches of bright green grass grow here, as the noblest of all animals
grazes in this corner of the arboretum: the yak.  "A YAK?!"  You ask
yourself?  Yes, a yak.  After having visited the Amazon Nation, Queen
Angelina was so impressed with the grace of the creatures that she decided
to take some back here for breeding purposes.  While it's true that no one
knew where this fine kingdom was until recently, Queen Melosa herself used
to get visits from Queen Angelina, who was under the guise of a different
name.  Yet whatever the reason the yaks are here, you can't help but marvel
at the fact that their popularity would spread so quickly.  The arboretum
continues east and south.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

  The ground here rises sharply toward the western mountain range. It is very 
rocky and pitted with small craters and holes. There are a few broken 
saplings and a couple of stunted trees growing here but there is not much of 
interest around. To the south, a cliff face blots out the view while, back to
the east, a jumbled area eventually gives way to the flat plains once more.
To the north, the foothills begin to wind their way east, though still on a 
northern track.

  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

like music to the ears.

Leafy disturbances
  There has been a disturbance in the hedges to the east, some of the branches 
have been snapped and leaves litter the ground. It looks like something was 
trying to cross through the hedges. You can't know if it succeeded without 
giving it a go yourself. The garden is supposed to be safe from predators, it
would be devastating if one had managed to find its way in.

A strawberry patch
  There are a few rows of strawberry plants, all showing an abundance of the 
bright red fruits. The strawberries are covered with little white seeds and 
all wear little green hats. They are almost ripe and ready to be picked, and 
there is a wooden bucket standing at the end of the rows, ready to receive 
the latest crop of berries. The smell of fresh strawberries drifts up to you,
momentarily covering the scent of the nearby herbs.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Stone Rotunda (G)
  The entryway to the stone pillar opens into a rather bland hallway of
gray stone walls.  The hallway continues around the pillar in a circular
fashion leading right back to the very place you are now standing.  There
are stairs leading farther up into the pillar.

  The third floor of the pillar appears no different than the second,
perhaps with the exception of a few small plants resting near the walls. 
You seriously begin to wonder why anyone would want to stay here in this
dull and dark tower.  You can look down the center of the pillar to the
bottom, and it seems like you are now hundreds of feet up into the tower.

The Courtyard Center (G)
  This is the center of the courtyard.  From here you can easily see all
three pillars towering high over the open interior.  Many of the locals
travel through here daily, but there is one magician in particular who seems
to never want to move.

  While the pathway runs east and west from here, you can tell that the
courtyard begins to really open up.  From here you can see the western and
eastern pillars just fine, but the southern pillar seems almost miles away. 
You are amazed at the diversity of people in this place.

Beneath A Canopy
  The pathway splits off here beneath a canopy.  Most of the local traffic
seems to come to a head in this part of the courtyard.  There is an elderly
woman here trying to peddle what goods and trinkets she has.  Perhaps it
would be a good idea to see what she has to offer.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

Approaching Diamond Castle (1607)

In front of Diamond Castle
  Doric columns of pure diamond support this magnificent castle.  Beams of
light encircle the dwelling, illuminating the crystal with an holy
brilliance and a divine majesty.  You slowly raise your hand up to feel the
outer wall, and despite having been exposed to the elements, it is as soft
and tender as a baby's skin, while still having an untold of inner
resilience.  You bow your head in respect for the castle, and notice a
welcome mat on the ground.  The mat is completely lavish as well, having
been woven with intertwined strands of gold and silver.  If the exterior is
any indication, the beauty and grace to be found within will surpass any
you have seen.

  After opening the diamond gate and entering the castle, your senses are
overcome with amazement and wonder.  Even the inner walls of this
magnificent castle are made of diamond.  As you step across the floor, the
shock of your feet smacking the ground is absorbed, and instead of making a
cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which
separates the rest of the castle from the arborium, and to the south is the
castle dining room.  The castle hallway continues east.

  Patches of bright green grass grow here, as the noblest of all animals
grazes in this corner of the arboretum: the yak.  "A YAK?!"  You ask
yourself?  Yes, a yak.  After having visited the Amazon Nation, Queen
Angelina was so impressed with the grace of the creatures that she decided
to take some back here for breeding purposes.  While it's true that no one
knew where this fine kingdom was until recently, Queen Melosa herself used
to get visits from Queen Angelina, who was under the guise of a different
name.  Yet whatever the reason the yaks are here, you can't help but marvel
at the fact that their popularity would spread so quickly.  The arboretum
continues east and south.

  The sun burning high above, makes venturing across the blood tinted
sand almost impossible. With each step your feet sink into the scalding
hot sands of this barren wasteland. In the near distance there is a
traveling wagon train moving from the East to the West. These wagons
do not seem to be carrying wares and goods, like a normal wagon train
should. A closer inspection reveals that each wagon contains a coffin, or
another type of container to hold the deceased. Perhaps these are the
infamous wagons that take the dead to the afterlife.

Before The Huge Iron Gates
  Finally you have reached the gates of this huge keep.  The stones making
up the keep appear to be made of solid obsidian.  A strange red aura glows
over the keep giving it an eerie look.  Thoroughly guarded, it offers no way
to enter but to defend yourself and find a way in once the guards are
incapacitated.  

[ Exits: east west ]
     A towering iron gate blocks you from entering the keep.
(Red Aura) There is no way around this large guard who protects the Keep.

Inside The Iron Gates Of The Keep
  Once inside the gates you enter a small courtyard.  To the south in front
of the main keep is a river of magma.  Damian uses this river as his first
barrier of protection from intruders.  Here before the river bank a nice set
of guards is here to greet you.  Perhaps they are not as nice as one would
hope.  

[ Exits: south ]
     A towering iron gate blocks you from exiting the keep.

Before the Wayward Alehouse
  Just off the path through the desolate pridelands of Abend, the dark 
continent, the only building within sight stands before you. The walls appear
to be constructed of a hardy wood, though they have not aged particularly 
well, and have several patches of weather-related damage throughout the 
visible section. The building is somewhat dark, though a steady hum of many 
intermixed noises can be heard through the walls. Directly in front of you is
a simple wooden door with a splintered surface and a dull grey doorknob.
Hanging above the door is a sign signifying what this building is. It's the 
Wayward Alehouse! The gravel path under you extends to the west and to the 
east.

>>    In the threshold of the Alehouse
  You are in the threshold of the Wayward Alehouse. The scent of smoke mixed 
with alcohol hits your nose as do the sights of this establishment. The floor
beneath you is entirely made of wood with no carpeting to speak of. Boots 
make quite a distinct thud when coming into contact with the old wood that 
makes up the floor of this building. Off to the east are the coat room and a 
staircase leading to the second floor. To the north, there the Alehouse 
extends, and you can see a bar off in the distance. The noise in here is 
quite elevated. Between the buzzing of conversation, the occasional battle 
cry, and a band off in the far corner playing "music," it can be difficult to
even hear one's own thoughts. To the west, a large open space with no tables 
or chairs to speak of.  The exit is back to the south.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
This patron is busting out some fresh moves!
Brandt, the owner of this "fine establishment", stands before you.

Coat (Armor) Check
  This is the coat room of the Wayward Alehouse. Patrons are encouraged to 
leave their unnecessary outer garments in this room for safekeeping while 
they enjoy the festivities of the bar area. "Coat" room is not entirely 
correct, as there are not many coats here, but rather pieces of armor.
Hanging on the walls, pieces of armor range from the simplest of hide tunics 
to steel breastplates, to horned battle helmets. There is a window giving a 
rather drab view of the path around the Alehouse. There is also a weapons 
rack, though it is oddly empty. A staircase extends northward to the second 
floor, and the only other obvious exit is back to the Alehouse proper.

north and south sides of both hallways, there is also a door to your east

as though there were torches on the wall. Perhaps there is some sort of 
magical force lighting these rooms.

Really, it is the same as the other rooms, except with a view and perhaps

Edge of the Nenukon (G)
  You stand at the edge of the Nenukon. A dark and twisted region of the world.
Deep within lies what is said to be the ultimate evil, and also the resting 
place of the only thing that can stop it. Beyond the Nenukon is said to be 
the Empire of The Far Country, a land of warriors, where the governing tribes
themselves are in a constant state of war.
