You wake up on Medical beds, then stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     (Magic) A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     (Magic) Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand in a training field with wet and muddy grounds.
As you continue down the fields,you realize that 
this was once a battlefield of the worthy and ruthless
but it has now been swept and turned into a training
ground.
Apart from the worn paths and unpleasant pools of mud,
this field is still be used as a training center, and
an older man in a brown uniform who is as tough as

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.  

[ Exits: north east south west ]
(Red Aura) (Angry) A small winged imp dives towards you from above.
(Hidden) (Red Aura) A small winged imp sneaks about here collecting information for its master.

In a Misty Swamp
  Standing knee-deep in the murkish water, you feel the curious sensation
of unseen creatures slithering against you.  The soft ripples trailing
across the water are rythmically entrancing, but you blink back to reality
when you see the reptilian creature which forms the ripples.  With a shiver,
you move on, wanting to be out of the mist-laden swamp.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

In a Misty Swamp
  Standing knee-deep in the murkish water, you feel the curious sensation
of unseen creatures slithering against you.  The soft ripples trailing
across the water are rythmically entrancing, but you blink back to reality
when you see the reptilian creature which forms the ripples.  With a shiver,
you move on, wanting to be out of the mist-laden swamp.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

A path through the hedges
  Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the path through the maze. The 
short grass is soft and spongy, which springs back into place, leaving no 
footprints nor any trace of passage. There is a stray apple lying on the 
ground, nestled comfortably underneath a section of the hedges. A soft 
snuffling can be heard, very faintly, but the creature who is making this 
sound is hidden from view.

[ Exits: north south west ]
     A juicy red apple is ready to eat.
(Golden Aura) A hedgehog is happily slurping up the contents of a broken bird's egg.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Shrine to the Emperor
  This is a very historical spot for the people of Kerofk, where the wizard
Rand entered this realm through the 'dimension portal' he made, and later
went on to found this city.  A giant slab of earth lies toppled over here, a
strange eye-shaped stone embedded in it pointing at the sky.  A strange
thrum of power in the background raises your hackles...  Remnants and echoes
of Rand's power, evidently.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You are somewhere in the middle of Kansas.  All around you are farms

farmhouse with a brown roof.  North you see a lush field.  Far to the

  You are outside the open door of a country farmhouse.  It is in okay

  Here, the wheat isn't waving-- it's bent over by the force of the wind. 
You look to the east and see the source of the wind: a giant tornado which
doesn't seem to be moving.  You ponder whether to investigate or to run back
to the farmhouse.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

  The shoe elves of Izar use this small pocket of space not for their
shoes, but for spare tools and supplies.  One wonders just how many sectors
of space they will eventually come to fill with shoes.  Knowing them,
someday this whole place may become known as Vidblain, the Shoe Space.  They
even have a last and jack set among the tools, which is unusual because
almost no one but the shoe elves remembers what those are these days.

wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

In tall grass on the plains
  The grass here is tall and thick. It appears that the herds of cattle and 
deer haven't fed in this spot in quite some time. Perhaps they do not graze 
this close to the low range of foothills to the west. As you look around, you
can see the eaves of a dark forest to the far north and, to the southeast, 
the large lone grove of ancient trees rises to greet the fluffy clouds. To 
the west, the foothills march toward a high range of imposing mountains. A 
large eagle suddenly appears from the crest of one of the distant mountains, 
winging its way over the grasslands in search of a meal. Insects buzz and hop
through the tall grass and rustling from deep within the shelter of the tall 
blades speaks of small animals going about their daily lives out on this flat
plain.

frolicking in the tall grasses.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to watch

  The plains seem to stretch on for miles. The soft grass underfoot looks to be
growing back and you guess that, at one time, this was a popular grazing spot
for the many herds of animals that call this flat land home. Far to the west 
you can make out a low range of winding foothills, and to the north, a line 
of trees which lead into a dark forest. The grasslands stretch out far to the
south, and to the south and west, the grove of trees stands out like a 
beacon.

Out on the plains
  The plains stretch out in all directions.  The openness of this place is
becoming a bit disturbing and the cluster of trees far to the north is
beginning to look more and more inviting.  Clouds race across the sky,
seeming to have no particular direction as the soft breezes blow, first one
way, then another, over the open prairie.  The chirping of birds,
occasionally mixed with the cry of a bird of prey is mixed with the buzzing
and whirring of insects.  In the distance, you can just make out a herd of
animals; from this distance, they appear to be grazing.

as softly blowing breezes dance among the tall blades of grass.  Flocks of

plume of smoke.  The sounds of running hooves carry to you on an errant

Out on the plains
  The plains seem to stretch on for miles. The soft grass underfoot looks to be
growing back and you guess that, at one time, this was a popular grazing spot
for the many herds of animals that call this flat land home. Far to the west 
you can make out a low range of winding foothills, and to the north, a line 
of trees which lead into a dark forest. The grasslands stretch out far to the
south, and to the south and west, the grove of trees stands out like a 
beacon.

Out on the plains
  The plains stretch out in all directions.  The openness of this place is
becoming a bit disturbing and the cluster of trees far to the north is
beginning to look more and more inviting.  Clouds race across the sky,
seeming to have no particular direction as the soft breezes blow, first one
way, then another, over the open prairie.  The chirping of birds,
occasionally mixed with the cry of a bird of prey is mixed with the buzzing
and whirring of insects.  In the distance, you can just make out a herd of
animals; from this distance, they appear to be grazing.

Thick vegetation on the river bank
  The vegetation here is very thick. Reeds, grass, even a few bushes with 
bright flowers grow here. There is evidence that something on the prairie 
feeds off of the vegetation here; some of the leaves look like they have been
nibbled. The ground is still wet but the vegetation has woven a fine mat of 
roots to keep the mud from being a nuisance. To the south, the swiftly 
flowing river rushes by while, to the west, the vegetation seems to give way 
to a sort of beach. The sounds of insects and birds surround you and the sky 
overhead is open, with clouds racing and dancing in fanciful shapes. Far to

  The plains seem to stretch on for miles. The soft grass underfoot looks to be
growing back and you guess that, at one time, this was a popular grazing spot
for the many herds of animals that call this flat land home. Far to the west 
you can make out a low range of winding foothills, and to the north, a line 
of trees which lead into a dark forest. The grasslands stretch out far to the
south, and to the south and west, the grove of trees stands out like a 
beacon.

Out on the plains
  The plains stretch out in all directions.  The openness of this place is
becoming a bit disturbing and the cluster of trees far to the north is
beginning to look more and more inviting.  Clouds race across the sky,
seeming to have no particular direction as the soft breezes blow, first one
way, then another, over the open prairie.  The chirping of birds,
occasionally mixed with the cry of a bird of prey is mixed with the buzzing
and whirring of insects.  In the distance, you can just make out a herd of
animals; from this distance, they appear to be grazing.

  The plains stretch out in all directions.  The wild prairie seems to sigh
as softly blowing breezes dance among the tall blades of grass.  Flocks of
small birds play among the white clouds as they slowly drift across the open
sky.  To the north and west, you can just make out a herd of animals, and a
plume of smoke.  The sounds of running hooves carry to you on an errant
breeze, and you catch a hint of water on the air.

  This road carved out of the stone sides of the mountain continues on,
twisting around the sides of the mountain as it travels ever onward to
places only the goblins know.  You wonder who could be in charge of all of
this.  Each goblin here seems to know what their purpose is here.

  This end of the road seems to be less traveled and you notice that many

  Pushing through the spectators, you draw closer to the fight along the
road.  You still can't quite figure out what's going on, but, a little
farther up, you can see goblins rushing around and yelling for more guards. 
Glancing to the east side of the road up ahead, you notice a large round
hole in the wall.  It looks like a cave of some sort; maybe some creature
wandered out into the goblins' territory?

  A huge fight is in progress here!  Several humongous goblins are wielding
spears and charging into what appears to be some kind of earthworm, although
it's not any kind of worm you've seen before.  This thing is huge, fully
eight feet long and probably three feet around.  It's a good bet this is
what caused that hole in the rock wall.  Obviously some underground, lost
variety of worm, this creature has three six-inch-long spikes protruding
from its snout.  Rearing up, it stabs forward with its head trying to impale
the goblins, while the goblins try to hold it at bay with their spears...

A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

Out on the plains
  The plains stretch out in all directions.  The wild prairie seems to sigh
as softly blowing breezes dance among the tall blades of grass.  Flocks of
small birds play among the white clouds as they slowly drift across the open
sky.  To the north and west, you can just make out a herd of animals, and a
plume of smoke.  The sounds of running hooves carry to you on an errant
breeze, and you catch a hint of water on the air.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

help vault

Help Keywords : Vaults.
Help Category : Equipment.
Related Helps : Inventory, Wishes, Kflag, Banking.
Last Updated  : 2020-10-13 16:17:05.

Syntax:  vault buy
         vault list
         vault put [item list]
         vault get [item list]
         vault upgrade [amount]
         vault sort (see 'help invsort')
         vault filter (see 'help ifilter')
         vault data

NOTE: Vaults are a high level feature for players with extensive equipment 
collections that they want to store long term. Most newer players will be
ok with a combination of Aardwolf bags and pockets wishes. As a new player, 
your trivia points are better spent elsewhere.

Vaults are a way to safely store equipment long term. The main difference 
between vaults and inventory (pockets wishes) is that items in your vault 
are not considered part of your inventory so do not count towards weight 
limits. Items in a vault cannot be located by other players but will still 
show in your own 'owned' list if they are owned.

Not being part of inventory also means that there is no risk of loss at 
death, from accidentally dropping them on the floor or losing them because 
a friend holding items for you stopped playing or got themselves deleted. 

Please note that vaults do *not* allow you to save anything you wouldn't 
normally be able to save and do not get around item timers - something 
with a timer still has a timer even in a vault. Having an item in your 
vault that you can't save with will warn you when you quit and the details
can be seen in 'quit check'.

You can put containers in the vault and they will take up as many slots
as items in the container. Items that already have the 'kflag' do not
take up vault space so once you have a vault we recommend putting those
in there right away for safekeeping.

The vaults are intended for longer term storage of collectibles and items
you don't use often and don't want to keep tracking in inventory. For day
to day use or characters just starting out on Aardwolf, you are probably
better off with the first couple of 'pockets' wishes.

You need to be in a bank room to use a vault. The options available are:

vault buy: 
  It costs 20 trivia points to open your vault with 20 storage items 
  included. 

vault upgrade [amount]: 
  You can upgrade your vault with an additional 30 slots (up to 50 total
  slots) at a cost of 1 trivia point per slot. After that, the costs 
  increases to 2 trivia points and increases by 1 trivia point every 50
  slots. To see the cost to upgrade a vault X times, use 'vault upgrade X'
  - when used without the confirm option, it will show costs and exit.

vault put [itemlist] : 
  Uses the same syntax as 'put' to put items in your vault.

vault get [itemlist] : 
  Uses the same syntax as 'get' to retrieve items from your vault.

vault list : 
  Shows the list and count of items in your vault.

vault data : 
  Shows the list of items in your vault in 'invdata' format. The counts 
  shown at the end are number of items, total number of items including 
  kflag equipment and vault capacity.

Similar to the standard recall skill (see 'help recall'), this spell will
transport you back to Aylor or your clan recall provided you are not cursed
or in no-recall rooms.  Unlike recall, there is no move penalty, and using
the spell to escape combat does not cause any experience loss.

When you have saved superhero stats, and your saved Dexterity and Strength
are higher than your current Dex / Str, then your max item and weight
capacity will be determined based on your saved SH stats. You won't have the
full capacity you had at SH because you won't have the benefit of stats from
SH equipment and spellups, but this should at least help a lot with
inventory issues right after remorting. Using the 'weight' command will show
when your saved SH stats are being used.

Once you have reached level 201 and remorted, your aard bags will stay at
level 201 but Tiers won't get the full benefit of bag over level 201 until
they reach the appropriate level. Main reason for this change is to help
with the equipment weight problems after a tier / remort / redo without
increasing carry capacity overall at high level.

You can now 'quest sell' a bag back to questor for 1,000qp.

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

There are many flags that can affect objects in Aardwolf:

Anti-Good/    It is not possible to equip these items if your alignment is
Anti-Neutral/ the same as the anti-flag (see 'help alignment').
Anti-Evil*    

Auctioned     Auction, Inc. stamps items they sell.  Shopkeepers will not
              buy these items.

Balanced      Objects that had their weight halved/doubled by a 
              clan skill.

Blessed       This flag currently does nothing.

Burn-Proof*   Magical fortification protects this item against damage
              from acid and fire.  

Clanonly      Only players from the clan that sells this object may save
              and quit with it. See 'help clanspying'.

Clanonlyperm  Prevents removal of the clanonly flag on closed clan
              equipment (via the clanadmin command).

Cursed        Cursed items can't be dropped and/or sold. You will need to 
              have them uncursed first.

Donated       Items donated to donation rooms cannot be auctioned or sold
              back to stores.

Evil          This flag currently does nothing.

Glow*         These objects can be seen and manipulated in darkened
              rooms.  Added with the 'illuminate' spell.

Held          Makes an item no-drop. This flag can be toggled using the
              'Keep' command, and will add (K) in front of the item name,
              read 'help keep' for more information.

Heroonly      This item can only be used by players at level 200 or 201.
              Tiers do not apply, the item cannot be used if the player is
              not hero or superhero.

Hum*          Allows an item to be detected and manipulated when blind
              or invisible.  Added with the 'resonate' spell.

Illuminated   The 'illuminate' spell successfully added stats to this item.

Invis*        The item is invisible to normal sight. Removed through 
              the 'solidify' spell.

Inventory     Items that are always available from a particular shop will
              show this flag when appraised in that shop.

Iskey         Keyloot ('help keyloot') will loot this item.

Keepflag      Items with this flag do not count as an item towards your
              carryable item limit.  (See 'help keepflag'.)

Lauction      Displayed while an item is on market (long-term-auction).

Magic         Items that are inherently magical are impossible to duplicate
              through magical means.

Melt-drop*    These objects are so fragile that they will turn into
              dust if dropped to the ground.

Nodisarm      This item cannot be disarmed, but can be willingly removed.

Nodrop        This item cannot be willingly dropped to the ground.  Added
              with the 'Curse' spell, removed with 'Remove Curse' or with
              the 'uncurse' wish.

Nogive        The item cannot be given to another player or transferred in
              any way. If you die with one of these it will stay in your
              inventory.

Nolocate      These objects cannot be located via magical means.  Thieves
              can set this with the 'Conceal' spell.

Nopurge       An imm's room purge will not destroy this item.

Noremove      This item is cursed and cannot be removed.  Added with the
              'Curse' spell, or removed with 'Remove Curse'.

Noreown       This item is owned to a player, and cannot be reowned using
              the trivia reown command.

Nosac         This item cannot be sacrificed (help sacrifice).

Nosave        If you are carrying this item, it will disappear when you
              leave the realm of Aardwolf. Certain objects will do this
              even without this flag set. There is no way to remove this
              flag on an item.

Nosell        An item with the 'nosell' flag cannot be sold to a store or
              fenced.

Nostats       Stats cannot be added to this item by any means.

Nosteal       An item with the 'nosteal' flag cannot be stolen by another
              player while this item is in your inventory.

Noshare       An owned item with the 'noshare' flag cannot be shared with
              anyone, not even a spouse.

Precious      The precious flag means that an item is special and protected
              from many actions that can potentially destroy items. Usually
              reserved for Quest items, Trivia items and special medals.

Recharged     Once-per-item skills/spells (recharge, for example) will
              generally add this flag once used.

Resonated     The 'Resonate' spell successfully added stats to this item.

Restrung      The item has had at least one of its object name or
              description fields customized via the restring option.

Rot-Death*    The forces of entropy in this object will cause the item 
              to decay shortly after its owner is killed.  If you die 
              before removing this flag, it is too late to stop the effect.

Saveable      Objects with this flag ignored level restrictions; as of
              27 Nov 2010, this is no longer necessary.

Solidified    Casting the 'Solidify' spell on this object yielded bonus 
              stats.

Static        Item cannot be changed. See 'help static' for more info.

Stolen        This item was gained through the shoplift skill and cannot be
              sold to a shop.

Unique        Items with this flag will not update when the base item is
              modified.  All clan items and anything with stats added from
              resonate, illuminate, tpenchant, etc., is considered unique.
              
v3            Objects with this flag may not have the 'tpupgrade' command
              used on it, either because the command has already been used,
              or the object is not eligible.  (See 'help tpupgrade').

Flags marked with * can be toggled with the 'setflags' command (see
'help setflags').
