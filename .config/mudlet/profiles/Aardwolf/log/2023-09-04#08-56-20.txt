  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Before a home
  Walking off the beaten path, you seem to have stumbled across an old-looking
log cabin. From here, you can see a large brick chimney; from which smoke is 
rising. You can also see three windows from this view point, although they 
appear to have been blacked-out, for unknown reasons. It is likely the owner 
of the residence does not take kindly to visitors without a welcome. A small 
plaque can be seen hanging above the doorway. The only other exits are to the
west, east and south.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

Grand Antechamber of the Sahuagin Palace
  The gloomy, stone walls rise above into a high, expansive dome that
vanishes into an inky darkness.  The lichen clinging to the stone gives off
a faint, sickly glow.  Monumental statues, carved from black, volcanic rock
are displayed on either side of you.  Each portrays a distorted, grotesque
Sahuagin and sharks performing horrific acts of torture to sea elves,
tritons and mermen.  The pure sense of evil that emanates from this chamber
causes you to sweat even in these underwater conditions.  To your north are
heavily-guarded, colossal coral-inlaid doors.  Guessing by the size of the
Sahuagin standing guard on either side, you get the feeling that something
of great importance is on the other side of those doors.  The deep black
eyes of the very large guard standing directly in front of the door fall on
you, leaving you with a twisting, nauseous feeling in your gut.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  There is an abrupt change in the placid ocean waters.  The skies have

as you find yourself being pulled down into the inky depths below you.

Grand Antechamber of the Sahuagin Palace
  The gloomy, stone walls rise above into a high, expansive dome that
vanishes into an inky darkness.  The lichen clinging to the stone gives off
a faint, sickly glow.  Monumental statues, carved from black, volcanic rock
are displayed on either side of you.  Each portrays a distorted, grotesque
Sahuagin and sharks performing horrific acts of torture to sea elves,
tritons and mermen.  The pure sense of evil that emanates from this chamber
causes you to sweat even in these underwater conditions.  To your north are
heavily-guarded, colossal coral-inlaid doors.  Guessing by the size of the
Sahuagin standing guard on either side, you get the feeling that something
of great importance is on the other side of those doors.  The deep black
eyes of the very large guard standing directly in front of the door fall on
you, leaving you with a twisting, nauseous feeling in your gut.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Further into a Jungle
  Further yet into the jungle, you climb your way through the deepening
underbrush, fighting away the insects that have acquired a taste for your
flesh.  In looking around, you notice that the brush covering the north path
is getting more and more dense, probably too dense to go on much farther. 
You can enter the opening here and force yourself the rest of the way. 
South is back the way you came.

roar
You roar at the sentry and instantly know you've made a mistake! The
cougress lunges at your hind quarter and you feel teeth sink into your tender
flesh. A calm comes over you as you realize she's not planning on eating you.
The calm quickly subsides as you feel yourself get whisked away! You try to
clear your mind and focus on where she's taking you, but confusion soon settles
in. The tall grass whips at your now bare back, stinging your skin with
each lope of the large cat. Suddenly the path becomes rockier, and pebbles
start bouncing around you after being kicked up by the sentry. With a loud
THUD a pacifying warmth overcomes you as the final clear thoughts run through
your mind, and you realize that it's your own blood that is running across your
face. Darkness ensues and an indeterminate amount of time elapses once you
pass out from the blood loss...
A Medic Tent (G)
  You awake to find yourself laying on a cot, with several attendants
surrounding you.  The pain in your leg still throbs.  A familiar face, human
at least, looks over you, checking the progress of your wounds.  The words
that fill the air, however, are definitely foreign, except for one voice-
the voice of Suzian is comforting, and in your language!  You try to
concentrate on that voice, making out bits and pieces here and there.  You
should probably pay her a lot of attention.

Cougarian Way
  The street opens up before you with lots of activity.  Your first look at
this grand city is somewhat disappointing.  Worried looks are worn on the
citizens, but it looks like businesses are buzzing as normal.  On the
buildings you see war propaganda posted 'By order of Her Majesty'.  What
battle are these people fighting?  Who is their enemy?  What is your
position on the matter?  From the assorted glares and occasional hopeful
look of a child, you know that a choice must be made.

Keenian's Claw Sharpening and Outfitting
  The shop you find here is dark and dank, with chunks of the wooden floor
missing from dropped weapons.  Various types of chain mail and plate armor
line the walls, most of them used.  The shopkeeper seems very friendly,
winking at you as you walk in.  She carries all types of wares, more of a
general store than anything.  Writing supplies are mixed in with the armor
and sharpening kits in the single display case.  As rundown as it looks, it
appears this is your only chance to stock up on these items.

Pumianna's Meats
  Long wooden tables fill the room, spotted with hungry cougarians.  The
cook, Pumianna, runs from table to table, laying out the fresh raw meat.  The
smell here is unsavory, but not completely horrible, as most of the
antelope blood is soaked up by the sawdust coating the floor.  You look
around for an empty seat, and then remember that the meat is all raw, and
decide that it might be a better idea to just strike up some conversation.

Cougress Bath House
  A common stop after stopping by Pumianna's Meats, the bath house is
nothing more than a large room with a sunken floor, filled with water
carried in from the river.  Here, the felines get the benefits of a nice
wash, without having to leave the city.  It looks like the water has been
brought in recently, as the bottom of the giant tub can still be seen with
ease.  A few of the citizens splash in the shallow water, but most are
lazily lying, basking in the sunlight allowed in by the open ceiling.  You
can see some hair collecting by a crude filter on the far side, and wonder
if they know just how valuable a sample of hair can be.

Continuing on Cougarian Way
  Here, further down the road, the citizens seem more sparse.  To one side,
you see a rusty gate with many locks and chains securing it shut.  On the
other side is a large, new building stands littered with war slogans urging
the Cougarian people to join the Cougarian Army Tactical Squad.  North of
here, the city seems to kind of drop off, with little more than a hole in
the ground.  You guess this is the den of a native, and pay it little
notice.  You wonder what the Cougarian Army might be like, and consider the
recruitment office.  Just then, a faded sign hung with wire on the rusty
gate catches your attention.

Cougarian Way North
  You continue along the road and find this part of town all but deserted. 
A small paved path runs to the north, and in the distance you can see that
it leads into a seemingly normal Cougarian den.  You can still hear the
bustle of the city to the south and contemplate going back to Pumianna's for
some fresh antelope meat.  You hear a noise from within the den and decide
to go investigate.

  They want you!  The C.A.T.S. Recruiting Office opens before you, with a
hardwood floor and scattered pieces of new furniture, including a large

From    : Ospario: Bard's Equinox Celebration (Sept. 22-25) Invitation
Forum   : Personal - #506921
To      : boot bard
Date    : Sun Sep  3 10:23:23 2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| An Eminently Exciting Equinox Event of Boundless Bardic Banter
| 
| Goodness, graces, and gracious greetings.
| 
| I bring word far and wide of a spectacle of such awe inspiring displays of
| wit and verbal fervor, that it would be a mortal sin to not inform my
| former brethren of the occasion. 
| 
| Some may remember me. I am Boot alumnus, Ospario. I recently haunted your
| clan hall as a devoted follower of the Unknown Soldier, incessantly
| pitching one multi-level marketing scheme after another in the throes 
| of a wormwood and nausea medication inspired fever dream.
| My welcome wore thinner with each until the door found me.
| 
| As I left, I was ready to spill gold, urine and dilute acetic acid into
| the hearts and homes of the world at large but found another path - within
| the halls of those gentle warriors of the mind, the Bards.
| 
| Times such as this, I could regale you with stories of entrails that spill
| into a relief of Whistlers mother, or the mewling of a dragonling as it
| suckles upon a morningstar in motion, but I tell of greater enterprises.
| 
| The Bard clan will be hosting an event on the weekend of the autumnal
| equinox, September 22-24th, and we cordially invite all Boot members
| to attend the events to beheld in clan hall and on gametalk, as well as be
| aware of the billion gold worth of crumbles that will be dispersed the
| entire weekend from the 22nd to the 24th. We will also be present to
| discuss the future that Bard clan may hold in store for any Boot members
| looking to leave the nest.
| 
| On Saturday the 23rd, we will be hosting a flyting competition with open
| registration for any interested parties. The easiest way to register will
| be through tells or notes to me, Ospario. Flyting is a deceptively simple
| and sincerely devious game of call and response in couplets. Each round
| will have two participants face off against each other, with two turns per
| player to come up with a line of poetry, usually similar to something
| another world may call battle rapping, and two turns per player to respond
| with a line to their opponent line, matching rhyme and theme. Prizes for
| top three contestants to be announced as the event draws nearer.
| On Sunday the 24th, the garrulous genius of our in-house navigator of
| culture, Grrdy, will be yours to go head-to-head with in a stirring game
| of trivia. Know the unexpected, and expect nothing, as to be champion of
| this trivia is to be champion of the universes mysteries, with TP tokens
| for top three contestants and gold for every correct first answer.
| 
| As for the clan, members will be available all weekend and are excited to
| talk to any of you about the exciting opportunities our fall recruitment
| drive can afford you.
| 
| We are a fun loving group of creative minded players that found the Muse
| of Aardwolf keening in a dark cave, splotched and gasping. In its final
| throes, this Bardic prophecy suddenly flashed opalescent star shine from
| somewhere deep within their crotch area. We hacked, slashed and stomped
| that husk of creativity until ribbons of flesh fell away to reveal the
| glittering jewel that is the new Bard Clan. 
| For a limited time, we are offering new members the ability to retain up
| to two promotions in their clan when they join with the brainy brutes of a
| Bardic bent. 
| 
| I know the comforts of Boot, and I know the cold realities of having no
| home to go to, letting your head fall on the nearest corpse at the end of
| a long day. We promise nothing less than total enlightenment and a state of
| living Nirvana, but our meal plans are pretty good too.
| 
| We look forward to seeing you on the equinox!

Date    : Sun Sep  3 14:35:56 2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| Good people of Aardwolf's Boot Camp,
| 
| I seek to join your ranks. I have played before as a different character, and
| I have returned as the warrior Ursuula. My MUD skills are tattered and I wish
| to connect with a solid base of comrades during my adventures.
| 
| My other character was welcomed warmly by your institution, and I hope to
| receive the same solidarity in my new persona. (Hope this is not too meta.)
| I cannot promise to be active every day, since my work life is very busy. But
| I find Aardwolf to be an excellent place filled with fun activities, and I
| love to help others the way I have been helped. 
| 
| I hope to become a Bootist and carry my insignia with pride. 
| Thank you for your time and attention.
| 
| Kind regards,
| Ursuula

| Hi KumoGami,
| 
| Congratulations on your new manor! Your porch and manor room are now set
| up for you.
| 
| You now have the use of the home command to take you directly to your 
| manor room and the ability to rstat it. This command will show you
| the room key of your manor (manorwoods-702) and should be used when
| purchasing upgrades for your manor.
| 
| (NOTE: Your porch room key can be found by 'rstat'ing your main room, and 
| then seeing the room key for whether the south exit leads.)
| 
| Please read the relevant help files listed in help mu-index for a complete
| overview of manor ownership.
| 
| Also, please include the costs and discounts associated with your upgrades
| when you create an upgrade note - This helps both you and the imms make
| sure you get what you are really asking for - read help mu-request for
| details on this.
| 
| Please continue using the manor upgrade generator! It is located
| at: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
|  
| Enjoy!
| 
| Dreamfyre
| On Behalf of the Immortal Team

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requests for upgrades must be posted on the 'upgrades' board to 'imm'.  If
your request is on another board, there is a very good chance of it being
overlooked.

Only clan leaders and manor owners may request upgrades.  If you are not a
clan leader, post your note to them and have them post it.  If your spouse
is the owner of the manor being upgraded, include them in the note so they
can give permission.  Upgrades stating 'My leader wants me to request these
upgrades' or 'Please change [this] in my spouse's manor' will not be
accepted.

Please include all necessary information for each upgrade.  This includes
room key (clan-# or manor(etc)-#, not UID), mob or object keys as needed,
and all strings (see 'help strings') for each request.  Remember to include
shopkeeper mob keys as well for clan item upgrade requests.

Also include the help file and item number where the upgrade is listed,
along with costs and any tier discount (if applicable).  To find the
correct help file for your upgrade, use the following prefixes:
help cdef- lists clan defense upgrade categories
help ch- lists closed hall upgrade categories
help eq- lists clan equipment upgrade categories
help cm- lists clan management categories
help mu- lists manor upgrade categories

These steps will help the Imms complete the upgrade quickly and make sure
it is exactly what you desire.  Thanks for the cooperation!


An example note:


Please add a new room up from my current manor room (manor3-9999).  The
name of the room should be @GUp the Oak Tree@w.  I will add a description
later.  I am eligible for T1 discount.

In this new room, add a level 30 healer:
Name: manor healer hello nurse
Sex: female
Short: a nurse
Long: This nurse is more than happy to tend your wounds.
Desc:
Dressed in the typical white outfit, this nurse is certainly ready to tend
to your needs.

Add a story to this healer: 
Time to take your temperature!  ...Oh!  Not that way!

Finally, add an exit north from this room to Aylor.

Total cost should be

MU-ROOMS 1.  Create a new room                 10tp
MU-MOBS  3.  Personal healer                3M      150
MU-MOBS  8.  Add/change a mob story       500k       25
MU-EXITS 1.  One-way exit to area           5M      250

Total is 8.5M/10tp/425qp, or 7.65M gp, 9tp, and 383qp after discount.

Syntax: help <keyword>           : Display help on given keyword.
        help search <keyword(s)> : List all help files containing keyword.

Aardwolf has an extensive list of help files available (over 1100 total).
These cover all topics- command syntax, policies/rules, history, husband, 
wife, work, and many more.

To access a help file, simply type 'help <keyword>' (for example, 'help
kick' or 'help magic missile'). The MUD will attempt to guess what help you
are looking for and display it if there is only one, or display a list of
options if several possibilities exist.

You may use the 'contents' command to see a list of all helpfiles based on
a particular topic.  Type 'contents' with no argument to see a list of
available categories.  Type 'contents <categoryname>' to see all help
files in that category.

You may also use the 'index' command to see all help files that begin with
a certain letter or letters, as well as a short description for each.  See
'help index' for more information.  Similarly, you may use 'help search
<keyword(s)>' to list help files which contain the given string ('help
search cure', etc.).

If you are a new player trying to figure out where to start, please read
'help newhelp'.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask on the
newbie channel (see 'help newbietalk') or other channels ('help channels').

(Note- some help files have additional, unlisted keywords.  This makes help
files more accessible while reducing clutter, and is intentional.)

| Hi KumoGami,
| 
| Congratulations on your new manor! Your porch and manor room are now set
| up for you.
| 
| You now have the use of the home command to take you directly to your 
| manor room and the ability to rstat it. This command will show you
| the room key of your manor (manorwoods-702) and should be used when
| purchasing upgrades for your manor.
| 
| (NOTE: Your porch room key can be found by 'rstat'ing your main room, and 
| then seeing the room key for whether the south exit leads.)
| 
| Please read the relevant help files listed in help mu-index for a complete
| overview of manor ownership.
| 
| Also, please include the costs and discounts associated with your upgrades
| when you create an upgrade note - This helps both you and the imms make
| sure you get what you are really asking for - read help mu-request for
| details on this.
| 
| Please continue using the manor upgrade generator! It is located
| at: http://bit.ly/aard_manors

| Enjoy!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Manor Upgrades: General Rules

1.  Each player may only own one manor.  
 
2.  Only one player may own any particular manor.  If spouses wish to 
share the cost of purchasing a manor, they must decide the owner between
themselves.  If they later divorce, the spouse set as owner will have the 
right to keep the manor for him/herself.

3.  Only the manor owner and their spouse may request and pay for a new
manor.  Likewise, only the owner and their spouse may request and pay for
manor upgrades on that player's manor.  If costs are split between spouse
and owner, both must be in the to: field of the upgrade note and both must
agree to the costs.  Clan accounts can not be charged for manor upgrades.
 
4.  The owner of a manor must agree to all requests made by a spouse,
regardless of who covers the cost of the upgrade.
 
5.  Spouse manor links will be removed upon divorce, without reimbursement.

6.  Clan links may be removed at a leader's request at any time, without
reimbursement.  Clan links are the sole responsibility of the clan
leaders.  Immortals will not intervene in the event a manor exit results
in a clan being breached.

7.  If a manor is sold, any existing 'free' description changes are not
transferred to the new owner- he/she must pay the cost per room/mobile/
object to change names/descriptions.
 
8.  Any player or clan's likeness (exact name or logo format/colors) used
in any manor upgrade needs the approval of that player/clan's leaders.

9.  In order to keep Aardwolf's environment lighthearted and respectful, 
any upgrades that contain political hot-button issues will be denied.

10.  The Immortals have the right to refuse or remove any upgrade found to
be offensive or abusive of rules, without reimbursement.
 
11. All manors are limited to 5 rooms (excluding porch), 8 objects, 5 mobs,
and 1 program per mob.

12. The owner of the manor may request to remove any resets free of
charge but keep in mind there are no reimbursements.

*** Please note that all upgrades need to be submitted to the Imms on
the upgrades board.

Imms: Reset object keyword to "Free Key".

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

small wall and with only a few buildings present. The hot sun beats down on

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Road before the small village (G)
  The woods finally clear as you approach a small village surrounded by a
small wall and with only a few buildings present. The hot sun beats down on
you as you see a desert far to the east. This appears to be the last stop
before the desert.  It might be a good idea to stock up on supplies before
traveling any further.

[ Exits: east west ]
     A short stone wall stands here, making a boundary.
(Golden Aura) A village citizen wanders about here.
(White Aura) A little old man is sitting on the stone wall here.
An old man says, "Welcome to the land of the Desert Prison, KumoGami! 
 Tales say that if you enter, you will never leave alive!  Whether these
 stories are true, I know not."

The old man sighs and shifts to an almost comfortable position.

An old man asks, "We're looking for a new superintendent.  Are you
 interested?"

He looks at you expectantly.

You have 2 tells waiting. Type 'replay' to see them.
