the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered

intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the

Moon Gate Road, East
  This is Moon Gate Road, which runs from Moon Gate all the way to the
cliff.  There is a tiny keep to your north, with an inn sign out front.  The
keep looks like it was built to withstand flood, earthquake, and even acts
of God!  Moon Gate Road continues east and west.

poles and halberds decorate the walls.  Breast plates stacked with cups of

  You are very near the city now.  There is a great gate to your east, with
guards slowly letting people in and out.  The walls surrounding the city
seem impassable, but several scorch marks along its length tells a different
stories about war and raids.  To your west is a rise where you may get a
better vantage point of the city.

View of a City
  Incredible!  From this vantage point you see a huge city to your east,
large enough to hold thousands of people.  Great walls encircle the city, no
doubt to keep the marauding monsters at bay.  The city is in a VERY
defensible spot in that over half its length is sprawled along the edge of a
cliff.  Beyond the cliff you see a dark ocean, reflecting the starlight
above very feebly.  The road continues west down the rise, and east, towards
the city on the edge.

  A few branches reach almost to the top of the aviary; however, most are
several feet below the top of the aviary.  The walls of the aviary are made
out of a sturdy mesh wire.  One spot was broken and fixed by putting a solid
steel plate over it.  The wind blows freely through the wires creating a
breeze for the birds to use to hover and glide.

  None of the trees reach this part of the aviary; they are all cut off
after eight feet.  Various rings are hanging from the ceiling, gently
swaying in the wind.  Several lightning fast birds are zipping through them
with ease, sometimes even upside down.  One of the flying creatures
attempted to do the same; however its wings were too large and it crashed
into the hoop.

  Two wires extend from the roof to the trees underneath.  Some birds are

  This part of the aviary is mostly avoided by all the flying creatures and
birds.  The stench rising from the ground has overcome several birds in the
past, causing them to fatally plummet to the ground.  The only time they
come here is to soar through the sky, drop trash, and circle around to go
right back to the better parts of the aviary.  The trees that grow around
this part of the aviary have lost their leaves because of the rotting
stench.

  As you make your way from Carvwin's Field, a faint smell of smoke breaks the 
peace of the forest. This is no ordinary cook fire though. You can't quite 
make out exactly what is burning, but it doesn't seem to be the familiar 
smell of tinder mixed with dry branches and pine needles. Something about 
this is very wrong, though it escapes you what else seems out of place.

Burning Forest
  Fires have sprung up all around, consuming the trunks of
thousand-year-old trees.  A tree, half-supported by the others on which it
fell, suddenly snaps, crashing to the forest floor amid a shower of sparks
and ash.  Another stump, still attached to its root-ball, groans with the
pressure it contains, threatening to split open from the searing blaze
inside.  Smoke surrounds you, cutting off your oxygen supply and mixing
dancing stars amid the sparks rising on the heat of the fires that spawned
them.

A single trunk still stands here, its bark long gone, tendrils of flame
running vertically against the hard-baked blackened wood.  The smoke here is
thick enough to cut, blotting out the way from whence you came.  The smoke

  In the forest, you come across a small shack.  It's fairly run down, and you
notice a small heap of trash in the corner. The only remains that would give
you a clue is a rather large red diamond laid out horizontally on the roof.
Inside the diamond, you see what appears to be some sort of white writing;
however, time has made the letters indistinguishable.

A Cobblestone Path
  A well-laid road lies here, acting as a path to service the sewers of
Aylor.  With the passing years, grass has poked its head through the
cobblestone, as the forest reclaims its seized land.  In some parts, the
grass is so thick that it is difficult to follow the path for more than a

The Forest of Illusions
  As you become more accustomed to the forest by exploring, the more the
forest lives up to its reputation.  The trees start to blend.  The trails
twist and turn.  And the sounds of the forest become consistent throughout

A Large Tree
  After searching the forest of illusions for some time, the canopy of the
forest opens, allowing the tallest tree in the forest through.  The light
pours in from the sky, illuminating what appears to be a very large grey
mound hanging from the massive trunk.  As you stare at the grey sphere, you
notice that it is vibrating slightly, and a barely audible buzzing sound is
coming from within.

The Queen's Lair
  The small tunnels that litter the colony all come together here, forming
a rather large area for the queen to stay in.  She is massive, bloated
almost beyond recognition because of the constant food and perpetual
pregnancy that her status has awarded her.  Occasionally, a worker ant will
show up to feed the queen and to take her eggs to the hatchery where they
will be tended.

you wouldn't expect from such a large ant.
The Queen ant says, "Hello, traveler. Maybe you would be interested in
 giving me a hand with a problem I have. If so, give me a nod."

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

marble.  Along the wall to the north, a tapestry, showing a nomadic hunting
party, chasing a lion across the desert sands, a palace rising in the

living vines, palm trees and flowering plants, potted and placed around the

The Palace Kitchen
  This section of the kitchen appears to have been used to hold animals
waiting for slaughter.  There are a few tethering posts for cattle, and
small pens for fowl and perhaps a few lamb.  The pens are broken and falling
down, and the braided tethers are brittle, almost falling to dust upon
touch.

  All around the room there are signs that this was once a place of frenzied 
activity.  A fire pit for roasting, pens for animals waiting for slaughter, and
enormous butchery tables are all empty and abandoned.  There is even a pump 
from which fresh water may have been obtained, but it is frozen, locked by grit
and sand.  There is no water here.

  Huge pillars, partially obscured by a mountain of sand, mark what was once 
the main entrance to the palace. The palace doors are crushed and crumpled 
beneath the many tons of sand that, by some catastrophe, buried the palace 
and its occupants so long ago. More of the collapsed entrance extends to the 
east, while to the south is a large and open greeting chamber.

Infirmary (G)
  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

  Stepping through a small opening in the woodline, you find yourself
standing on the outer edge of what looks like a huge battlefield.  Your
mouth drops and you stare at the scene before you.  Chairs, tables, brooms,
and various other household items are fighting against animals!  How can
this be, though?  Furniture does not move and it certainly does not fight,
and even stranger is that the animals seem to be working together and using
makeshift weapons!

At the stairs
  Emerging from the collapsing hallways, you wipe your forehead and release
a sigh of relief.  This place is as bad as Richard's.  Both towers are on
the verge of collapse after so many months of constant battle.  You notice
some stairs here that seem to go both up and down, as well as collapsing
hallways leading off in all directions, though the stairs draw your
attention at the moment.  Looking up, you can see a large platform fastened
to one side of the stairwell.  It appears to be some sort of rigged pulley
system.  It is probably used to get furniture down to the ground floor,
though you can see the guides for the platform run down to what you think is
the cellar as well.
