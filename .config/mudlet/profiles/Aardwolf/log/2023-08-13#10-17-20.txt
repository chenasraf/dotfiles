Edge of the Nenukon (G)
  You stand at the edge of the Nenukon. A dark and twisted region of the world.
Deep within lies what is said to be the ultimate evil, and also the resting 
place of the only thing that can stop it. Beyond the Nenukon is said to be 
the Empire of The Far Country, a land of warriors, where the governing tribes
themselves are in a constant state of war.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron 
arrowheads and decorated with an iron worked coat of arms. To either side of 
the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

  To the south the large wrought iron gate clangs shut, the metallic sound 
resounding dully in your ears. To the north, an enormous bluestone manor sits
in the centre of a large estate. Just off to the side of the path is a guard 
house, where the gate guard can keep a watchful eye on the comings and goings
of the visitors to the estate. Sprawling green lawns, colourful flowerbeds 
and well-tended trees speak highly of the level of care which the 
groundskeeper injects into his chores.

  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to
the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and 
west a path made from small white stones seems to lead around the manor.

  The foyer of the large bluestone manor is quite imposing. Everything in the 
manor speaks of wealth; old and timeless wealth. The floor is made from a 
white and black marble, inlaid with gold veins and specks. A deep, rich red 
carpet runner extends down the length of the main hall from the other side of
the foyer. Solid, polished wooden pedestals stand on either side of the front
doors, and hold a large antique vase each, which are many centuries old.
Long glass windows, framed by thick velvet curtains, allow plenty of 
sunlight to filter in. The occasional guard can be seen patrolling the 
grounds. A butler, impeccably dressed, greets you in the foyer.

Grand staircase
  A grand staircase with solid marble steps dominates the centre of the room.
Half-way up the staircase there is a wide landing, where the staircase splits
and branches off to each side, circling back on itself as it reaches up to 
the top floor. A smooth, highly ornate wooden balustrade frames the marble 
staircase. On either side of the staircase, the red carpet flows on and 
through to the rest of the manor, passing long windows framed by thick velvet
curtains, that show the perfectly manicured gardens and lawns. Large 
tapestries of various fight scenes and hunting expeditions, frozen in time, 
grace the spaces between the windows. Wooden tables and pedestals hold a 
variety of flowers and ornaments that look old and expensive.

Grand hall
  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

East wing
  The east wing of the manor has many doors along its length. To the north, 
halfway along the hallway, double doors with glass panels show the room 
within. A little further along is a door in the south wall with a large iron 
lock. Considering the wealth on display in the manor, there must be treasured
items within. At the far end of the east wing are highly ornate double doors 
with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along
the entire length of the hallway. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles.

Grand hall
  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

[ Exits: (north) east south west ]
     (Magic) A large chandelier, adorned with many candles, lights up the hall.
     (Magic) A deep red carpet runs the length of the main hall.
(Translucent) (Golden Aura) A sprite, on delicate wings, flies around the manor.
(Translucent) (Golden Aura) Carrying a tray of tea and biscuits, this servant is humming a lilting
tune.
On the wall hangs a portrait of an unsmiling young lady with her mother.
(White Aura) A portrait of a man in shining armour holding his sword hangs on the wall.
An unsmiling young man in clerical robes looks down at you from a gilded frame.
Made from a deep red velvet, these drapes frame the archways to the east and west.

  The kitchen is a large and spacious room that is a hub of activity for most 
of the day. A fire pit near one wall has a boar, all basted with spices, 
slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.
A very old door leads down to the cellars.

  At the far end of the wine cellar the dust has settled pretty thick. Cobwebs 
hang limply from the ceiling and the clatter of small claws on the cold stone
emerges from the darkness. Footprints and scuff marks mar the dust on the 
floor along the walls. Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling and 
most of the bottle slots have bottles in them. The bottles are turned 
regularly and only have a light coating of dust on them. One of the racks 
along the north wall looks a little odd, like it isn't sitting flush against 
the wall. The floor is marked in front of this section in particular and is 
perhaps worth a closer look.

  Cool stone steps lead up to the kitchen above, where the hustle and bustle of
activity seems to permeate down through the thick floor. The cellar is well 
used and barrels of food, flour and rice are stacked in neat rows. Further 
into the cellar the air quietens and the dust has begun to settle to the 
floor. Barrels of wine and ale are stacked against the southern wall, having 
been imported from around the lands of Andolor. Some of the barrels bear the 
marks of Kingsholm, Beer Goblins and Aylor.

Wine cellar
  In this hidden room is the Earl's private collection and the wine is only 
brought out on special occasions. The staff rarely come so deep into the 
cellars so it makes a perfect hiding place. There are some extremely rare 
vintages of wine that would be worth a small fortune if sold to the right 
person. There are thick cobwebs in the room and small carcasses of rats are 
caught in the larger webs. The skittering of many clawed feet echo off the 
cold stone walls leaving you uncertain as to which direction it is coming 
from. A gust of wind through the open door blows a cobweb onto you, which 
adheres to your clothing.

Wine cellar
  At the far end of the wine cellar the dust has settled pretty thick. Cobwebs 
hang limply from the ceiling and the clatter of small claws on the cold stone
emerges from the darkness. Footprints and scuff marks mar the dust on the 
floor along the walls. Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling and 
most of the bottle slots have bottles in them. The bottles are turned 
regularly and only have a light coating of dust on them. One of the racks 
along the north wall looks a little odd, like it isn't sitting flush against 
the wall. The floor is marked in front of this section in particular and is 
perhaps worth a closer look.

  Cool stone steps lead up to the kitchen above, where the hustle and bustle of
activity seems to permeate down through the thick floor. The cellar is well 
used and barrels of food, flour and rice are stacked in neat rows. Further 
into the cellar the air quietens and the dust has begun to settle to the 
floor. Barrels of wine and ale are stacked against the southern wall, having 
been imported from around the lands of Andolor. Some of the barrels bear the 
marks of Kingsholm, Beer Goblins and Aylor.

slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.

  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

Half-way up the staircase there is a wide landing, where the staircase splits
and branches off to each side, circling back on itself as it reaches up to 
the top floor. A smooth, highly ornate wooden balustrade frames the marble 
staircase. On either side of the staircase, the red carpet flows on and 
through to the rest of the manor, passing long windows framed by thick velvet
curtains, that show the perfectly manicured gardens and lawns. Large 
tapestries of various fight scenes and hunting expeditions, frozen in time, 
grace the spaces between the windows. Wooden tables and pedestals hold a 
variety of flowers and ornaments that look old and expensive.

  The foyer of the large bluestone manor is quite imposing. Everything in the

white and black marble, inlaid with gold veins and specks. A deep, rich red 
carpet runner extends down the length of the main hall from the other side of
the foyer. Solid, polished wooden pedestals stand on either side of the front
doors, and hold a large antique vase each, which are many centuries old.
Long glass windows, framed by thick velvet curtains, allow plenty of 
sunlight to filter in. The occasional guard can be seen patrolling the

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Immediately to the south is a grand old oak tree, blocking further progress

interest in your passage and is completely oblivious to the mundane 
ambulatory creatures that pass under its branches.

  The aptly named Woodlands Drive leads in a north south direction, through the

  A stately oak tree blocks progress to the south, and as a result, the road

Little sunlight reaches the road before you, but despite this, there is no 
sense of dread. The spirit of the forest is benevolent, and you traverse its 
domain in peace.

  South of here, you see that the road splits, the main part heading in a 
southeasterly direction, and the lesser part heading westwards. Although 
narrow, the road is evenly paved with cobblestones that are in general good

growing out from nearby trees.

direction while the lesser road heads off to the west. At the center of the 
fork stands a great old oak tree, sentinel-like, guarding the road. And yet, 
there is nothing threatening about the tree or the forest. All is peaceful 
and the dangers of the world seem far off indeed.

  Woodberry Hill Road begins to curve with the hill itself, to the west. The 
terrain is a little rocky, and a little rough, and as a result, the forests 
have not been cleared for farming of any kind. Only the odd fur trapper or 
fisherman might find a living here. Otherwise, the scattered homes in the 
area appear to be built for leisure and relaxation.

black roots covering the earth. Dark magic pools from within the 
forests heart. Blackening the mahoganies covering the darkened 
sky. No daylight reaches this area, an endless night within the 
blackened heart. Creatures rustle within the darkness, eyes 
peering through the foliage. Wolves, with blood red eyes, as 
large as horses prowl the entrance to the forest. Their next 
meal a clueless traveler, seeking out the witch 
within. Asrai flit within the tree branches, hidden from the 
sunlight above. Beautiful faeires with an aversion to sunlight.
Dryads care for these tiny creatures, keeping them safe from the 
wolves below. Moura Encantada settle at the forests edge, 
combing their fiery tresses, waiting for a helpless 
victim. The Baobhan Sith lurks within the 
heart of the forest, her thirst for blood ever 
unquenchable. A traveler brave enough to follow the 
stone path through this demonic forest might find themselves at the 
entrance to the witchs lair. At the heart of the forest, 
in the darkest parts where the magic is most volatile, is the 
witchs lair. Surrounded by rotten trees and blood thirsty 
Enfields. These monsters stand guard beside a pitch-black 
grimoire, with a giant amethyst on the cover. Whether bravery 
or stupidity, the travelers approach ignites the 
amethyst, a purple glow illuminating the glade. A portal 
springs from the amethyst, large enough for one to step through. A 
warning appears across the tree line. The witchs lair welcomes you.

Kitten's Mysterious Entrance
  Up from amidst the burial mounds of this mysterious place, a dense, dark 
wood of surpassing glory rises to claim all of those who dare approach it.
Shaded by ancient trees that project like fingers to the gods, and thickened
by dense undergrowth that britstles with colourful flowers and cruel thorns, 
this is not a spot for the faint of heart, nor for the challenged direction.
Here, a single, innocent wrong turn could bring about a long and slow death 
in nature's unholy embrace.

However, should one choose to press onward, finding and forging along the 
barely discernible path inward - passage marked by massive oaks that stand 
sentinel for the owners of this place - they will eventually come to a 
sizeable clearing of trampled grass where nature's tall timber reluctantly 
yields to the necessity of some sort of landing space. The only clues to 
whatever creatures may come and go from here exist in the huge, clawed 
footprints that scarred the earth. More than a human's span, they end in 
five vicious points that the elements have failed to whisk away.

Clues to why such beasts would care to land here can likely be found in the 
darkly gleaming castle, ahead, erupts from the earth as though carved from 
it. Made of some kind of tenebrous stone, it acts as a focus a shimmering 
beacon, of hope and possession, that glows in the night.

Even from this distance, the awesomeness of the place leaves little doubt 
that to continue on to its gates is to become subject to not only its glory 
but the glory of the feline power that, in this small slice of Alagh, rules 
forever unchallenged.

Stumbling blindly though kilometres of impenetrably thick fog, hour after hour, you 
eventually happen upon a vast clearing of lush green grass surrounded by trees that 
can be seen peeking over the dense vapourish circle. You step forward onto a wide 
gravel path lined with square patches of creeping phlox grown in a variety of colours. 
Gazing down the neat path, you stare in awe and wonder at the sight of an enormous 
castle which appears to have been grown from either a single massive tree or a cluster 
of several trees joint together via magic. Flying to and from tall towers, whose leafy 
branches reach up to the heavens like hands longing to touch the sky, are large winged 
reptilian creatures,adding to the mystical aura of the castle. 

Various colourful flowers dot the green grass with vibrant hues and a multitude 
of smaller trees grow around the castle in an uneven pattern,metal and crystal wind chimes 
tied to their branches that create a serene tinkling sound that is carried on the gentle
breeze. 
 
A long metal arch stretches towards huge mahogany doors and appears to be the width of two 
carriages as well as tall enough for a giant to comfortably pass through. Entangling the 
arch are vibrant green vines with intoxicatingly sweet scented golden flowers, creating a
thick leafy and flowery tunnel to the grand doors, which are engraved with opposing 
twin dragons. At the end of the vine tunnel, just before the immense doors, is a single
stray vine tendril which is hanging down and is twisted around a gold bell from which
hangs a thin silken ribbon that could be used to ring the bell.

  A sheer cliff stretches as far as you can see to the left and right of
you. Straight ahead is a simple sign that reads:

     ! WARNING ! Stay back from Edge. Unstable and wet cliffs.

Even this far back from the edge, the spray from the waves pounding
against the cliffs far below fills the air with mist, and occasional
blasts of water shoot up and over the cliff wall.

There is a narrow wooden bridge, just barely wide enough for one person,
that stretches the long distance from the edge of the cliff to an island
off the shore.

On the island, you can just make out another gigantic tree that appears to
dwarf the giant redwood behind you.  Two smaller trees, planted almost
like guard towers, stand to the left and right of where the bridge meets
the island.

There is well dressed elf standing before the bridge, seemingly only to
sell his wares, but you get the sense that he is acting more as a guard to
signal the others that watch, unseen and silent, from the trees on the
island.

Knoll Ridge End
  A giant redwood must have been planted here by the gods themselves. It stands
sentinel at the northern end of the Bluffs, a grand beacon to the sailors at 
sea, informing them of their location in relationship with the continent of 
Alagh. Few travel by sea to this district, due to the steep cliffs, narrow 
beaches and treacherous reefs skirting the shore.

Knoll Ridge
  The road along the Bluffs is nearing its northern limit. Beyond to the north 
there is a giant redwood, and beyond that, a steep drop off into the ocean 
below. The ocean extends uninterrupted to the broad horizon and beyond, 
mountains of clouds, pretentiously reaching up to touch the moons.

A Clockwork Portal
  Nestled within the heart of a verdant, undulating landscape of dreams, you
come across an entrance quite unlike any other, framed by twin pillars of
labyrinthine coils, meticulously fashioned from a confluence of bronze
gears and sprockets, infused with a celestial patina that whispers tales
of antiquity.
 
Standing resolute against time's eternal progression, the towering archway
emits a mesmerizing hum - a rhythmic lullaby harmonizing with the
never-ending dance of the cosmos. Its surface is adorned with hundreds of
minute hands, all ticking in hushed unison, an orchestrated ballet of
time. The hands move with hypnotic grace, tracing imaginary numbers upon
invisible clock faces that cover every inch of the entrance, from its
foundation in the earth to its zenith that scratches the cotton candy
clouds.
 
At the heart of the entrance, a majestic door of polished mahogany stands,
seamlessly integrated into the body of the clockwork marvel. A glistening
brass keyhole, wrought into the shape of an infinity symbol, lies at the
door's center, a promising yet enigmatic invitation to any worthy
keybearer. Next to the keyhole is an intricate brass chain soaring up into
the great works within. A small sign invites you to ring the bell for
admission if you lack a key.
 
Above the entrance, flanked by a myriad of interconnected cogs and
flywheels, is the great master clock. Its ornate hands glide over a face
of milky moonstone, pointing to symbols that are not hours but elements 
water, air, earth, fire, ether  a gentle reminder of the timeless synergy
between the macrocosm and the microcosm.
 
An ethereal light bathes the clockwork enrance, casting an array of
intricate shadows that dance and weave tales across the ground. The light
shifts in a slow and deliberate waltz, dappling through the mechanical
marvel, and painting the land in hues of gold, amber, and obsidian as the
day cycles through its rhythmic stages.

Looking down at your feet, you notice that you are actually standing on what 
seems to be a floor scattered with several colored tiles in several shades 
such as�Yellows, Oranges, Greens, blues, and purples in no particular

infinitesimal tile. As you bend down to carefully examine each one, running a
finger across a row of red tiles,� you notice your fingernail sinking into 
the taffy-like substance. Thinking twice you quickly withdraw your hand, and 
instinctively inhale the sweet aroma, only this time, separating everything 
else knowing it to be the scent to be strawberry.

Along a Quiet Path
  You cautiously continue along the cliff path, leaving the old redwood tree 
behind you, and breathe in the salty air whipping around you. In the distance
you see a low, mossy stone wall, with a quaint and inviting wooden gate.
Intrigued, you make your way along the cobblestone path, through the gate, 
and towards a beautiful cottage. It's tucked under a canopy of evergreens, 
residing in a small, peaceful meadow. There is a pleasant smell of woodsmoke 
in the air, from the cottage's fireplace within. As you walk through the 
meadow, you see lights dancing in the grass and hovering in the air, ethereal
in the dying light of day. You draw closer to the home, and a flock of Ravens
caw merrily at you from the roof, welcoming you into their midst. Before you 
realize it, you're standing on the stoop of the cottage, staring at the heavy
wooden door in front of you, and the ivy that trails across it. Glinting 
under the leaves, off to the right, a small, copper doorbell catches your 
eye... Will you ring it?

~'�'~._.~' A Twisting Cliffside Trail '~._.~'�'~
  You half walk, half slide down the rocky trail that winds around the south
side of the cliff. Even as you journey downward, you wonder how you will ever
make it back up...�
 
Reaching the end of the trail, you find yourself safely on a small ledge. 
The only exit is the north, unless you wish to plunge into the waters below. Cut 
from the very face of the cliff, is a small, intricately carved, stone archway. 
You can't see much of what is through the archway as it leads back into the
side of the cliff. At the apex of the arch, is an ornate sign that simply
reads, "Nadziyu". To the right of the arch, a beautiful, antique, 
silver bell. 
A string hangs from the bell inviting visitors to ring.

SLIDING DOOOOOWN THE HILL!!
  ***OOPS!!*** 
You lost your footing and slid down the hillside! *THUMP!*  
Sliding on your back, you land at the bottom of the hill, your body in a
heap of plants as you regain your balance. Looking around you, you realize
YOU'RE WAIST DEEP IN POISON IVY! You rush out of the weeds and cling
onto the trees to pull yourself out and you realize YOU'RE HUGGING
POISON OAK!!  
 
Not believing your awful luck, you press on from the poisonous
surroundings and come to a dilapidated house, ivy vines suffocating the
structure. Pulling back the foliage near the creaky door, you find a name
plate that simply reads, "Swoyer". From within the manor comes the
distinct sounds of a giggling sprite. Peaking through the cracked glass of
the windows, you believe this to be the home of Lil Poison Sumac!

engraved with symbols you're sure you've seen before, but you can't quite

become more connected to your surroundings. There is a sweet smell of incense

terrain is a little rocky, and a little rough, and as a result, the forests 
have not been cleared for farming of any kind. Only the odd fur trapper or

A porch of starbursts
  Taking a step onto this porch, the first thing that assaults your nostrils 
are a mixture of sweet scents. Although you cannot decipher where the aroma 
is coming from, a light breeze stirs the flavors around more, confusing you.
Looking down at your feet, you notice that you are actually standing on what 
seems to be a floor scattered with several colored tiles in several shades 
such as�Yellows, Oranges, Greens, blues, and purples in no particular 
pattern. Upon closer inspection you notice small scuff marks on each 
infinitesimal tile. As you bend down to carefully examine each one, running a
finger across a row of red tiles,� you notice your fingernail sinking into 
the taffy-like substance. Thinking twice you quickly withdraw your hand, and 
instinctively inhale the sweet aroma, only this time, separating everything 
else knowing it to be the scent to be strawberry.

Dairu's front porch
  Stepping through a wooden, chest-high gate, you find yourself on a porch�of
a medium-sized house.
In here the air is pleasantly warm.
Every so often, a tepid breeze caresses your face, carrying a scent of�roasted
meat.
All around you, the smell of a comforting campfire permeates the�surroundings.
For some reason, the weather in here, always seems to be consistent, no�matter
the conditions outside.
The porch itself consists entirely of wood. Just now you notice the�intricate
carvings, the planks building the floor, as well as the wooden�posts supporting
roof are depicted with different sceens from far away�lands.
You see pictures of eagles, hawks, and dragons, carved meticulously into�the
wood.
The picture of a huge griffon is carved into the floor. The creature's�tail
pointing towards the entrance of the house, while it's head peers�directly at
the gate, as if it is there, to guard the place.
It is probably not a coincidence you assume, that the beast's mouth is�open,
showing several rows of ferocious-looking, needle sharp teeth.

  This mystical enchanted forest is filled with giant sequoias,
white and chestnut oaks, black willows, mohoganies and 
many other trees that stand tall reaching up to the 
heavens like arms reaching to the sky. The thick foliage 
glimmers with vibrant hues ranging from lush emerald green to 
autumn red and russet bronze. Branches thick and thin jut 
out from these trees covered in fine foliage of different 
colours. Squirrels run across the branches collecting nuts, 
owls perch on these branches sleeping the day away, blue
birds, swallows, humming birds and mocking jays nest in 
the higher branches of the trees, chipmunks play 
in the branches over head, koalas forage for leaves 
while a lone tasmanian devil hunts through the branches.
Lovely sprites with their slender bodies, long colourful 
hair and enchanting eyes sit on these branches plaiting each
others hair. Their smaller cousins the pixies flit about
from branch to branch mischievously while faries 
with their beautiful wings fly from branch to branch helping
the baby animals. Deep within these large trees 
is an enchanted city with elves, nymphs, naiads, sylphs and 
dryads. Below these trees bears rest with their cubs, foxes hunt 
for their next meal, rabbits hop about merrily, buck frolic 
and unicorns stand guard of their home. A little way 
down from this lavish paradise is a large flowing crystal 
clear bewitching river with sandy beach like river beds 
and a large glittering stone in the center of the river. 
On the river beds lie some beautiful mermaids with fair 
hair sunning with dark haired nymphs, blue haired naiads 
and gorgeous sirens. On the large stone sit dark haired
mermaids, fair haired nymphs, white haired naiads and 
exquisite sirens luring unsuspecting humans to 
their doom. Across the river is a breath takingly stunning
castle, several flags flutter atop towers that reach up to 
the heavens as though in longing to touch the sky,
enourmous sturdy silver grey walls stand fast against any
potential threats that might make it through the dangers 
of the forest. 

The legendary castle Camelot.

tiny silvery fish occasionally leaping above the surface. The surrounding

>>    *[NOEXP]* Kitten's Mysterious Entrance
  Up from amidst the burial mounds of this mysterious place, a dense, dark 
wood of surpassing glory rises to claim all of those who dare approach it.
Shaded by ancient trees that project like fingers to the gods, and thickened
by dense undergrowth that britstles with colourful flowers and cruel thorns, 
this is not a spot for the faint of heart, nor for the challenged direction.
Here, a single, innocent wrong turn could bring about a long and slow death 
in nature's unholy embrace.

However, should one choose to press onward, finding and forging along the 
barely discernible path inward - passage marked by massive oaks that stand 
sentinel for the owners of this place - they will eventually come to a 
sizeable clearing of trampled grass where nature's tall timber reluctantly 
yields to the necessity of some sort of landing space. The only clues to 
whatever creatures may come and go from here exist in the huge, clawed 
footprints that scarred the earth. More than a human's span, they end in 
five vicious points that the elements have failed to whisk away.

Clues to why such beasts would care to land here can likely be found in the 
darkly gleaming castle, ahead, erupts from the earth as though carved from 
it. Made of some kind of tenebrous stone, it acts as a focus a shimmering 
beacon, of hope and possession, that glows in the night.

Even from this distance, the awesomeness of the place leaves little doubt 
that to continue on to its gates is to become subject to not only its glory 
but the glory of the feline power that, in this small slice of Alagh, rules 
forever unchallenged.

Stumbling blindly though kilometres of impenetrably thick fog, hour after hour, you 
eventually happen upon a vast clearing of lush green grass surrounded by trees that 
can be seen peeking over the dense vapourish circle. You step forward onto a wide 
gravel path lined with square patches of creeping phlox grown in a variety of colours. 
Gazing down the neat path, you stare in awe and wonder at the sight of an enormous 
castle which appears to have been grown from either a single massive tree or a cluster 
of several trees joint together via magic. Flying to and from tall towers, whose leafy 
branches reach up to the heavens like hands longing to touch the sky, are large winged 
reptilian creatures,adding to the mystical aura of the castle. 

Various colourful flowers dot the green grass with vibrant hues and a multitude 
of smaller trees grow around the castle in an uneven pattern,metal and crystal wind chimes 
tied to their branches that create a serene tinkling sound that is carried on the gentle
breeze. 
 
A long metal arch stretches towards huge mahogany doors and appears to be the width of two 
carriages as well as tall enough for a giant to comfortably pass through. Entangling the 
arch are vibrant green vines with intoxicatingly sweet scented golden flowers, creating a
thick leafy and flowery tunnel to the grand doors, which are engraved with opposing 
twin dragons. At the end of the vine tunnel, just before the immense doors, is a single
stray vine tendril which is hanging down and is twisted around a gold bell from which
hangs a thin silken ribbon that could be used to ring the bell.

Woodberry Hill Circle
  The rolling hills of Shady Acres seem old, ancient in fact. It is rumored 
that they are not hills at all, but barrows of the ancient race that once 
inhabited these woods. This was a race of elves so they say, druidic in their
worship, who for reasons unknown, left with their belongings and disappeared 
forever from Alagh.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Witch's Lair Entrance
  The forest ahead, overgrown with giant sequoias and oak trees, 
black roots covering the earth. Dark magic pools from within the 
forests heart. Blackening the mahoganies covering the darkened 
sky. No daylight reaches this area, an endless night within the 
blackened heart. Creatures rustle within the darkness, eyes 
peering through the foliage. Wolves, with blood red eyes, as 
large as horses prowl the entrance to the forest. Their next 
meal a clueless traveler, seeking out the witch 
within. Asrai flit within the tree branches, hidden from the 
sunlight above. Beautiful faeires with an aversion to sunlight.
Dryads care for these tiny creatures, keeping them safe from the 
wolves below. Moura Encantada settle at the forests edge, 
combing their fiery tresses, waiting for a helpless 
victim. The Baobhan Sith lurks within the 
heart of the forest, her thirst for blood ever 
unquenchable. A traveler brave enough to follow the 
stone path through this demonic forest might find themselves at the 
entrance to the witchs lair. At the heart of the forest, 
in the darkest parts where the magic is most volatile, is the 
witchs lair. Surrounded by rotten trees and blood thirsty 
Enfields. These monsters stand guard beside a pitch-black 
grimoire, with a giant amethyst on the cover. Whether bravery 
or stupidity, the travelers approach ignites the 
amethyst, a purple glow illuminating the glade. A portal 
springs from the amethyst, large enough for one to step through. A 
warning appears across the tree line. The witchs lair welcomes you.
Enter at your peril.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Pilgrims on a Long Journey
   A small path from the main road leads to the west, into the thick forest.
The sunlight above begins to be choked out from the cover of trees, with
branches lush with life. Birds fly and sing overhead, while small rodents
scamper along the trees. A low fog begins to roll in from all directions,
obscuring vision. The only light here comes from a series of runes along 
the floor that glow lavender. The warm air is richly fragrant, soothing; 
a mix of wildflowers and incense that seems to come from all around. The
illuminated runes direct northward, with faint light on the horizon, which
shimmers in the distance, muted by the fog. As you progress to the north, 
the breeze picks up; not harshly, but enough to make hair flutter. Faint
musical tones begin to play, caughty by the wind, a melody that draws you
in, guiding you northward along the path. With each step taken, the music
increases in volume. Stringed instruments and drums are accompanied by a
guitar and maraccas that blend perfectly, creating a harmony that soothes 
emotions, invokes deep feelings within. As your feet lead you forward, you
close your eyes and push through the shimmering at the end of the path, to
find yourself in a small cavern. The cave is pitch black, though lightning
beetles and fireflies flit about, providing some light. You turn to look 
from where you came, only to see nothing but the heavy fog. The soft light
from the bugs illuminates a pedestal, with a floating orb atop it. The orb
emits a low hum as it levitates in place, its surface deep blue streaked
with crimson and purple. You find yourself mesmerized by this object, the
colors and the sound entrancing. Attached to the pedestal is a small bell
with a knocker, built into the side. A thought, not your own, comes to
mind; a single command:

    "Ring the bell if you wish for enlightenment."

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:

sky. No daylight reaches this area, an endless night within the 
blackened heart. Creatures rustle within the darkness, eyes 
peering through the foliage. Wolves, with blood red eyes, as 
large as horses prowl the entrance to the forest. Their next 
meal a clueless traveler, seeking out the witch 
within. Asrai flit within the tree branches, hidden from the 
sunlight above. Beautiful faeires with an aversion to sunlight.
Dryads care for these tiny creatures, keeping them safe from the 
wolves below. Moura Encantada settle at the forests edge, 
combing their fiery tresses, waiting for a helpless 
victim. The Baobhan Sith lurks within the 
heart of the forest, her thirst for blood ever 
unquenchable. A traveler brave enough to follow the 
stone path through this demonic forest might find themselves at the 
entrance to the witchs lair. At the heart of the forest, 
in the darkest parts where the magic is most volatile, is the 
witchs lair. Surrounded by rotten trees and blood thirsty 
Enfields. These monsters stand guard beside a pitch-black 
grimoire, with a giant amethyst on the cover. Whether bravery 
or stupidity, the travelers approach ignites the 
amethyst, a purple glow illuminating the glade. A portal 
springs from the amethyst, large enough for one to step through. A 
warning appears across the tree line. The witchs lair welcomes you.

to the north that it will turn eventually to the east. A number of evergreen 
saplings, freshly sprouting from fallen pine cones have taken root at the 
roadside, and behind them, providing the backdrop, their stately parents 
stand guard.

  Woodberry Hill rises, not too high, to the east, and falls, not too low, to 
the west. Hidden among the trees are residences, the like of which you have 
never before seen. They are barely discernible from that which belongs in 
nature - tree, sapling, bush and boulder.

Woodberry Hill Circle
  These rolling hills seem like they have been here since time began. It is 
rumored that they are not hills at all, but barrows of the ancient race that 
once inhabited these woods. This was a race of elves so they say, druidic in 
their worship, who for reasons unknown, left with their belongings and 
disappeared forever from Alagh.

  Woodberry Hill Circle is named so, because it travels the perimeter of 
Woodberry Hill in a near perfect circle. The trees on either side of the road
are similarly symmetrical in their growth, all lush and perfectly formed. To 
the south, Woodberry Lane begins, and leads east into the forest.

A Rocky Cliff
  A sheer cliff stretches as far as you can see to the left and right of
you. Straight ahead is a simple sign that reads:

     ! WARNING ! Stay back from Edge. Unstable and wet cliffs.

Even this far back from the edge, the spray from the waves pounding
against the cliffs far below fills the air with mist, and occasional
blasts of water shoot up and over the cliff wall.

There is a narrow wooden bridge, just barely wide enough for one person,
that stretches the long distance from the edge of the cliff to an island
off the shore.

On the island, you can just make out another gigantic tree that appears to
dwarf the giant redwood behind you.  Two smaller trees, planted almost
like guard towers, stand to the left and right of where the bridge meets
the island.

There is well dressed elf standing before the bridge, seemingly only to
sell his wares, but you get the sense that he is acting more as a guard to
signal the others that watch, unseen and silent, from the trees on the
island.

Woodberry Hill Brookside
  A road sign declares the road now to be called Woodberry Hill Brookside.
This appears to be a statement to the effect that the Woodberry Brook is the 
most prominent feature of the road at this point. The brook is rather pretty,
and the sound of its waters rushing over pebbles fills one with the desire to
sit down on a rock and cast a line.

  The rushing waters of the brook pour over a little waterfall, to settle 
peacefully into a quiet rock bordered pool. In a grove of trees on the other 
side of the pool hosts a family of white-tailed deer - doe and two fawns, 
enjoying the wild grass growing in tender tufts of green.

A Tranquil Courtyard
  A regal rod-iron gate gleams brightly in the sunshine. Stepping through you 
notice a courtyard bordered by colorful shrubs. Their soft floral scent 
drifts languidly around you, providing a comforting sense of calm and 
relaxation. The nearby waterfall creates a stream that runs through the area,
ending in a sparkling pool of water gurgling happily in the courtyard's 
center. You follow the blue marble walkway from the gate and up to a 
surprising site: a geodesic solar powered dome shining in the sun. Main room.

  The road leads past a peaceful pond, fed by Woodberry Brook. Lily pads form a

Bullfrogs croak and crickets creak as a jay streaks past, to land lightly 
upon a willow branch.

A Patio of Granite Extending Into The Ocean (G)
  Extending out into the ocean itself, this quarter-circle patio of quartz 
flecked granite exemplifies the beauty of the ocean and sun. A soft rain 
falls constantly upon the edges as the ocean's waves break upon it and send 
water into the air. Surrounding the entire patio is a medium height wall of 
the same granite allowing someone to easily lean over and gaze outwards.
Intricate patterns of waves have been inlaid into the wall with lapis lazuli 
which glistens from the sun and water. In the middle of the patio is a small 
dais over which a small roof of black marble is raised upon columns of the 
same material, providing shelter from the water.

  Extending out into the ocean itself, this quarter-circle patio of quartz

water into the air. Surrounding the entire patio is a medium height wall of 
the same granite allowing someone to easily lean over and gaze outwards.
Intricate patterns of waves have been inlaid into the wall with lapis lazuli 
which glistens from the sun and water. In the middle of the patio is a small 
dais over which a small roof of black marble is raised upon columns of the

A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

  Immediately to the south is a grand old oak tree, blocking further progress

ambulatory creatures that pass under its branches.

Hanging Gardens of Bodies
  You clamber amongst the roots of the huge oak tree and fall between them.
Skulls, skins, bones and feathers hang from the branches. The forest plants 
reek of death. You sink into the litter of leaves and the broken parts of 
bodies that have putrified beneath your feet. Maggots fall from above as you 
scramble over a pile of intestines. To the north is a small opening, 
illuminated by a soft greyish light. Covered by a thorny briar it does not 
seem possible to enter. Hanging to one side is a small copper bell.

  Having ascended up through the mists of the forest, the fog gives way to 
vast grove of majestic Sequoia Redwoods and mighty Oak trees. One Oak 
stands out the most, as tall and large as the Sequoias but radiating it's own
mystical glow, dancing with members of the Fae world along with soft echoes 
of sweet welcoming song.  Upon the gentle wind the sweet scent of 
Dragonsblood and Rose inscense flows between the trees. The earth beneath 
your feet approaching the massive Oak soft to almost feel as if you are 
walking among the clouds themselves, giving the feet & body the feeling they 
can rest from the long travels behind. This Oak old but alive, the dark 
wood of it's trunk twisting and rising like a giant coil of arthen rope 
reaching into the canopy of the surrounding Sequoias, it's own branches 
reaching as wide and dense as the roots beneath your feet. Before you, is a 
shimmering portal large enough to walk through. Next to the doorway you lay 
eyes upon a hand sized glowing white pentacle embraced by a pair of 
crescent moons giving belief that this must be the seal of calling.

A Forgotten Path
      The forest stretches on in all directions, though the verdant growth
feels peaceful rather than oppressive.  Massive columns of oak and fir
rise up from the floor, their impressive size complemented by the smaller
dogwoods thriving in the shelter below.  High above, you can still catch
the occasional glimpse of unbroken sky, though for the most part the light
reaching the forest floor has been gentled by the leafy canopy.  A soft
breeze whispers between the trunks, its noise masking the occasional sounds
of woodland life.
    Cresting an arbored hill, the undergrowth betrays no obvious signs of
traffic, yet the impression lingers that this area is well-traveled...
an impression reinforced by the unexpected presence of a lone centaur
who has materialized before you.  Beyond him, a section of the forest has
thickened considerably, forming a natural corridor through the trees.

An Inhabited Royal Oak
  Stepping east between two of the saplings that line Woodlands Drive, you find
yourself in a tranquil clearing in the woods. The clearing is cropped to the
north, east and west by large river oaks. One such tree, immense and majestic,
dominates the north end of the clearing. A neat path leads through knee-high
underbrush to the tree's colossal trunk. As you approach, you determine the
trunk must be forty feet in diameter where it meets the forest floor. You also
begin to discern, as you near the arboreal mammoth, that the path leads up to
a great hinged front door hewn out of very same tree trunk. Framing the door is
a porch build of four stout posts, twenty feet high, supporting an oak trellis
fashioned from the leaves of the forest. A wood rail rings the porch and four
rocking chairs decorate it, subtly accented by groups of lush potted plants.
Your eyes scan up the tree, following the ancient trunk's climb from ground to
forest canopy, and you notice other unusual features: Two tall, narrow windows
are carved out of the tree about twenty feet above ground level. An opening in
the east side of the oak leads to a platform supported by a thick branch. This
platform is surrounded by a banister, and from it a set of steps leads to yet
another, higher platform in the tree. In an awe-struck moment, you hold your
breath, and in the resulting silence, you think you can barely make out the
sound of water running. Focusing on that sound, you realize that somewhere just
north or east of here, a creek surreptitiously crawls through the undergrowh
of the light forest...........................................................

  A red fox bounds across the road before you, scampering after a mole or mouse
too small to make out with any certainty. The fox disappears from sight, red 
tail flashing briefly between the leaf laden saplings growing by the road.
The quaint road continues along a fairly straight north and south direction.

  Mist rises from the shaded road, swirling mysteriously as you pass. Heavy 
drops of moisture fall randomly from the tree branches overhead. The air is 
quiet, sounds muffled by the thickness of the forest. The dampness begins to 
seep into your boots, and the thought of it raises goose bumps on your arms.
The warmth of your cloak relieves you of the fleeting chill.

There is nothing out of the ordinary in this small clearing 
within the wood, except for the large white spaceship that 
is stationed in the middle of it, gleaming in the sunlight. 
A bespectacled young lady pokes her head out of the open cockpit, 
and calls out for your identity. Before you can reply, a blonde girl 
surfaces on the ship, peers at you intently, and just waves you to 
come aboard. Intrigued, you go against your better judgement and 
climb up the ship's steps. You seat yourself in a large, rather comfy
brown chair, and the blonde straps you in with a wink. 

After a few seconds, the ship jolts upwards to the sky,
the scenery rippling before your eyes.

  This ancient grove of trees stand strong and proud in spite of the chaos and
turmoil that surrounds it. Enormous fir, pine and cedar thousands of years 
old and hundreds of feet tall grow unchecked and undisturbed, all but 
blocking out the sun, yet somehow the forest floor is teaming with lush 
foliage and pillowy moss. These woods seem deep and dark and eerily silent.
To the north lies a rather large cave mouth, nearly concealed by the dominant
vegetation. A sickeningly sweet smell drifts from the darkness...

|You find yourself at the base of a huge tree.    |
|Steps jut out from the trunk spiralling into its |
|uppermost branches where a whole network of      |
|platforms and rooms connected by rope bridges    |
|hang among the branches. Climbing the stairs you |
|find strange large purple fruits with green      |
|dome-shaped lumps dangling from the branches of  |
|the tree. At the top, the stairs open out to a   |
|large house built upon the fork of the largest   |
|branches. You see a wooden doorbell built next to|
|the door, perhaps you should ring it...          |

  The road takes a turn here, heading west and south from this corner. Fallen 
logs have been pulled aside, in order to keep the road clear. There are signs
of an old forest fire, the bases of the trees yet standing, gristled in 
black.

  The trees here, better in size than any seen in other parts of the woods, 
must be the most ancient of trees. Some have fallen, from age or disease, and
lie rotting, returning their nutrients into the soil for future saplings to 
feed upon.

  This road leads north, deeper into the forest. To choose to follow the road 
is to choose the forest, to accept it as a refuge and home. The road leads 
away perhaps, from material things, towards a place of peace and tranquility.
As if to bring these very thoughts in perfect harmony with reality, you 
notice that a fawn, silly and curious, has been following you, just off the 
road.

  On either side of Maple Lane, the forest looms. It is almost like a jungle,

  The lane is interrupted here by a huge maple tree. Passing to the south of it, 
you see the lane splits into Forest View Drive, and to the north of it, 
Forest Hill Circle. These roads are well marked by neatly painted road signs,
hammered to the maple tree. The whole appearance is that of a busy traffic 
circle around a great monument, but there is no real traffic here - with the 
exception of the occasional fox and rabbit.

A Home in the Forest
  Nestled into a grove of oak trees is a stone house.  The roof is made of light-colored thin stone
slabs that are expertly joined together to prevent the weather from entering the home.  The roof 
slants down at an angle to prevent snow from building up, and extends about 10 feet from the house 
over the porch.  The porch itself is made of smooth stone, with a set of stairs leading down the 
ground.  The part of the roof that covers the porch is held up with square-shaped pillars made of 
the same material as the floor of the porch.  The wall between the porch and the house has two 
windows that let Savyor enjoy the view of the forest, and a dark wooden door that not only keeps the 
wind from entering, but also allows him to invite in his welcome guests.

  Once entering the wrought iron gate, a beautiful meadow extends before
 you with mature silver birches and elm casting shade and
 shadow. Blue bells, foxglove, red and 
 yellow poppies blanket the vibrant green lawn,
 while in a somewhat wild state, still manages to be orderly and well
 kept. On the far right as you enter is a cultivated rose garden growing
 on trellises leaning against the moss-covered wall that surrounds the
 property. Next to that, stacked neatly, are two cords of seasoned wood.
 To the left, very near the house is what seems like an ancient fountain,
 patinaed from age, gurgling water for the many birds that make this home.
 A stone pathway leads to the front porch of the quaint cottage. There is
 an open veranda with the roof made from slate and the porch is made from
 stone. The wall is made from wide dark wood slats. Purple 
 climbing clematis plants, with bountiful blooms, grow in ceramic pots on 
 either side of an arched door made from thick wood with full length 
 paneled windows behind them along with two glow lamps that adorn the wall 
 as well. The door handle and knocker are made of wrought iron 
 and crafted to look like tulips.

The Men of Letters Secret Bunker
  
Following the river down a dead-end road you come across what appears to
be a power plant sitting atop a hill. It looks to be in a state of
neglect as if it has not been in use for many years. 

Searching around the rivers bank you discover a solid, metal
door framed in concrete. Above the door, careved into it's concrete frame
is a strange symbol. Known as a Unicursal Hexagram, you recall seeing
this symbol among your many adventures and heard it called by another
name, The Aquarian Star. It is said to have stood at the gates of
Atlantis

Staring at the door it dawns upon you. This must be the fabled Men Of
Letters secret bunker! Tales of this place have echoed throughout time
among intellects of magic and mysticism. Warded against any evil ever
created, this is where The Men of Letters are said to have stored every
object, scroll, and spell ever collected for thousands of years under one
roof. It is the supernatural mother lode. If knowledge is power, then
this is the most powerful place on Earth.

A chill runs the length of your spine as you realise anything you could
ever need, against any foe, lies right beyond the door infont of you.
Alas, try as you may the door refuses to budge. As you turn to walk away,
you take one last look over your shoulder, as you walk away from the
largest collection of magic in existance.

Lost in the Woods
  Stepping off the road you begin weaving through the fallen trees, over, under
around and through. Quickly the road behind is lost from sight as you follow 
what might have been a game trail at some age long past. Slowly, as you push 
through low-hanging evergreen branches and underbrush, you begin to hear the 
soft musical babble of a brook close at hand. Following it you suddenly stop,
gazing in on a small clearing. You feel an unexplained, firm pressure against
you that prevents you from entering space ahead, as if to protecting the 
clearing from from the outside world.

explains why it has complicated yet rich wetland ecology and possesses the 
largest group of Bolboschoenus planieulmis in Taiwan. Due to diverse 
geographical features, the species of its ecology is quite abundant. Every 
year around fall and winter, large flocks of migrating birds would come here 
for either short or long stay over the winter, serving as the best spot for 
bird-watching.

Forest View Drive
  Green leafed branches form a shady canopy over the road. Black squirrels 
scamper up the trunks of the trees, their tails trailing behind. They nestle 
into the knot-hole nest in the greatest of trees, and peer out of it, curious
about your intentions.

  The road is little traveled here, as evidence by the moss covering the 
cobblestones, and the brush and saplings creeping and closing in on the 
shoulders of the street. The older trees, further off the road, appear to 
bend forward, peering curiously at the traveler, wondering at his purpose in 
coming this far into the forest.

Forest View Drive
  Forest View Drive twists briefly from the west, and turns south. The forest 
on each side is dense, and impassable. Many trees, long fallen, lie strewn on
the ground like an unfinished game of pick-up-sticks, as played by the giants
of old.

Following the river down a dead-end road you come across what appears to
be a power plant sitting atop a hill. It looks to be in a state of
neglect as if it has not been in use for many years. 

Searching around the rivers bank you discover a solid, metal
door framed in concrete. Above the door, careved into it's concrete frame
is a strange symbol. Known as a Unicursal Hexagram, you recall seeing
this symbol among your many adventures and heard it called by another
name, The Aquarian Star. It is said to have stood at the gates of
Atlantis

Staring at the door it dawns upon you. This must be the fabled Men Of
Letters secret bunker! Tales of this place have echoed throughout time
among intellects of magic and mysticism. Warded against any evil ever
created, this is where The Men of Letters are said to have stored every
object, scroll, and spell ever collected for thousands of years under one
roof. It is the supernatural mother lode. If knowledge is power, then
this is the most powerful place on Earth.

A chill runs the length of your spine as you realise anything you could
ever need, against any foe, lies right beyond the door infont of you.
Alas, try as you may the door refuses to budge. As you turn to walk away,
you take one last look over your shoulder, as you walk away from the
largest collection of magic in existance.

the beautiful structure. Ivy vines climb up the walls and surrounding 
the manor is a vast array of trees filled with different colored leaves of
red, yellow, and orange. A stone pathway leads to the entrance
and a large archway sits in front of the two large twin doors, etched with what
looks like sort of tribal designs in crimson. Large twin lion statues sit on
either side of the archway toward the porch, they seem to come to life and roar
at you in greeting. You bravely walk toward the doors and knock loudly. 
A dark-haired man with a butler uniform answers the door, "Hello, we've been 
awaiting your arrival." he says as a wry smile plays upon his face.
Before you know it you step into...

  There is a pond to the east of the road, bordered by grassy banks and and

beyond the pool, a small clearing forms, where the deer graze undisturbed.
Everything is green, including the sheen of the pond where long-legged water 
bugs jig.

Walking up hill from the forest road below, you emerge from the foliage to
find a two-story wood cabin.  The small cabin is lovingly built, obviously
warm, with a thin plume of smoke leisurely trailing above the chimney.  In
the windows you see a happy couple, sitting and talking happily as candles
flicker in the windows.  You find yourself drawn to the home, attracted by
its humble hospitality and refuge from the surrounding wilderness.  On the
porch is found a simple bench, frequently used in the warmer months, and a
small table, perfect for afternoon coffee or tea.

A chaotic mix of colourful wildflowers grow in a light blanket over the

Away to one side you hear the sound of running water, a fountain hidden

The Men of Letters Secret Bunker
  
Following the river down a dead-end road you come across what appears to
be a power plant sitting atop a hill. It looks to be in a state of
neglect as if it has not been in use for many years. 

Searching around the rivers bank you discover a solid, metal
door framed in concrete. Above the door, careved into it's concrete frame
is a strange symbol. Known as a Unicursal Hexagram, you recall seeing
this symbol among your many adventures and heard it called by another
name, The Aquarian Star. It is said to have stood at the gates of
Atlantis

Staring at the door it dawns upon you. This must be the fabled Men Of
Letters secret bunker! Tales of this place have echoed throughout time
among intellects of magic and mysticism. Warded against any evil ever
created, this is where The Men of Letters are said to have stored every
object, scroll, and spell ever collected for thousands of years under one
roof. It is the supernatural mother lode. If knowledge is power, then
this is the most powerful place on Earth.

A chill runs the length of your spine as you realise anything you could
ever need, against any foe, lies right beyond the door infont of you.
Alas, try as you may the door refuses to budge. As you turn to walk away,
you take one last look over your shoulder, as you walk away from the
largest collection of magic in existance.

  Stepping off the road you begin weaving through the fallen trees, over, under

what might have been a game trail at some age long past. Slowly, as you push 
through low-hanging evergreen branches and underbrush, you begin to hear the 
soft musical babble of a brook close at hand. Following it you suddenly stop,
gazing in on a small clearing. You feel an unexplained, firm pressure against
you that prevents you from entering space ahead, as if to protecting the 
clearing from from the outside world.

into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, 
stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills. In front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into 
greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither 
formal, nor falsely adorned. There had never been such a place where nature 
had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an 
awkward taste (Austen).

  Judging by the size of this tree, it must be ancient. The trunk is wider than
some houses and rises high into the sky. While there are no obvious 
handholds, the rough bark has deep enough grooves that a sufficiently

look large enough to rest on should you need a break. It's difficult to be 
sure from the ground but it looks like someone has constructed a small hut on
one of the upper branches.

vine-entangled trees. In the distance, the shades of green lighten, and 
beyond the pool, a small clearing forms, where the deer graze undisturbed.
Everything is green, including the sheen of the pond where long-legged water 
bugs jig.

  A multitude of leafy branches form a shady canopy over the road. Black 
squirrels scamper up the trunks of the trees, their tails trailing behind.
Despite no shortage of acorns on the ground, a pair argue loudly over a stash

  Heading upwards and through the ornate pillars, you see a clearing and what 
looks like an ancient crypt deep in the woods to the north. A massive 
petrified tree is growing up along and around its walls. Rumour has it that 
this may also be the epicenter of the vines which have taken hold of the dark
forest, and that this is the last outpost for those brave enough to set out 
into the woods...

An Abandoned Bunker
  
Corrosion has occurred, and vines run rampant over the entrance. It appears
a tree has grown right through the middle of it. However, something doesn't
look quite right though, and you simply just can't place your finger on it.

  Woodlands Drive is the longest continuous route through the forest. The road 
is well kept by all the residents, who take turns at clearing the leaves in 
fall and snow in winter. Each season has its own personality, bringing new 
life, warmth, nourishment and tranquility.

  The road leads southwards further into the woodlands, and north as straight 
as a crow's flight towards Woodberry Hill. A narrow lane, bordered by two 
rows of evenly spaced maple trees, heads off in an easterly direction from

  The lane is interrupted here by a huge maple tree. Passing to the south of it, 
you see the lane splits into Forest View Drive, and to the north of it, 
Forest Hill Circle. These roads are well marked by neatly painted road signs,
hammered to the maple tree. The whole appearance is that of a busy traffic 
circle around a great monument, but there is no real traffic here - with the 
exception of the occasional fox and rabbit.

  On either side of Maple Lane, the forest looms. It is almost like a jungle,

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:

Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:

cast 'word of recall'
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

Syntax:  tpspend <option>  (See below.)

For many of the options available with trivia points, mobs have been
specially coded in Aylor that will take care of things for you without
needing to see an imm. Read 'help trivia points' for information on other
trivia point spending options and for a list of ways to get trivia points.

The 'tpspend' command allows you to spend trivia points at the Ravi
Enterprises office, which is located within the Aylorian Temple of Ivar,
north of recall. (runto ravi)

The following options are available through the tpspend command:

(Please be careful to check the syntax when using this command.  Refunds
will not be given.)

aura is the Aura of Trivia (see 'help aura of trivia'). (6TP) 

bag is the Trivia Sleeping Bag (see 'help sleeping bag'). (15TP)

bcp will give you a chaos portal ingredient.  There is a very rare 
chance this ingredient will be silver, platinum, or diamond.  (See 'help 
cptypes' for more information.) (5TP)

corpse will bring all retrievable corpses in the game to you. (1TP)

name <item> <keyword> adds a keyword to an item at a cost of 1 tp.  
The item must be in inventory, not worn or in a container.  Do not use 
color codes- this is the 'use' names, not the 'look at' descriptions.  See 
'help strings'. (1TP)

potion is the trivia spellup potion (level 220 sanctuary plus all three
Imm spells (see below)). (2TP)

remarry will remove your marriage timer, allowing you to immediately 
be able to marry again, removing the 'thirty day or remort/tier' 
restriction. (10TP)

restore will restore your hp/mana/moves to full.  (Contact an Imm to do
a global restore, which restores all players.) (2TP)

sex will permanently change your gender. Make sure you are not under
any other sex-changing affects; see 'help sex' for more information. (5TP)

spellup is the trivia spell-up cast directly on your character.  It will
include sanctuary, combat mind, bless, fly, divine faith, and one of the
three random Imm spells (see below). (1TP)

token removes a trivia point from your character and adds a trivia 
point token to your inventory.  It costs 100,000 gold coins to convert a 
trivia point into a token.  See 'help trivia token' for more details.  
(Note, this command is logged; transferring trivia points to an alt is 
considered multiplaying and against the rules- see 'help multiplaying'.)
(100,000 gold)

Imm spells include Valgard's Might, Shifty's Sleight of Hand, and Creator's
Wisdom.  If you are already affected by the random Imm spell that is cast
during the trivia spell-up, it is wasted; you do not get a different spell
instead.

The owner of an Aura of Trivia may sell it for two trivia points by visiting
Ravi in Aylor and using the syntax 'tpspend sell aura'.

Various other trivia functions can be carried out at specialized stores run
by Ivar Enterprises.  (See 'help trivia points' for more explanations and
related help files.)  These shops are located in the west plaza off
Starlight Way:

Add/change weapon flags         : The Aylorian Enchantment Clinic
Add/change/remove item flags    : Ivar's Item Remodeling

The Aura of Trivia is a special item purchased from Ravi via the 'tpspend'
command ('runto ravi'), at a cost of six trivia points.  It may also be 
received as a very rare, random daily blessing reward. The Aura of Trivia is 
always level one, regardless of a player's actual level.

An 'Aura of Trivia' has a default set of stats ( +1 Con/Str/Wis and +5
hitroll/damroll ) as well as a few additional random stats; like other worn
equipment, it may also be enchanted.  The item is worn in its own wear slot
('above') and thus may be worn alongside other auras (which are worn in the
'float' location).

The owner of an Aura of Trivia may sell it for two trivia points by visiting
Ravi in Aylor and using the syntax 'tpspend sell aura'.

An Aardwolf Aura of Trivia can be tpenchanted up to 10 times at the cost of 1
trivia point per tpenchant (see 'help tpenchant').

This video shows how to purchase the Aura of Trivia in Aardwolf:

Syntax: tpenchant <weapon in inventory>
        tpenchant aura

When used on weapons:
For a cost of two trivia points per use, this command will enchant a weapon
carried in the user's inventory.  Unlike the 'enchant weapon' spell, this
casting does not fail, does not add a level to the weapon, and guarantees a
minimum addition of +1 to hitroll and damroll.  Lucky casts may add +2 to
both, and may also possibly add an attribute point.  

This command acts as though the enchant spell was cast by an Immortal; it
has the maximum chance for bonuses from casting, and moons do not affect
the casting.

An item can only be enchanted to half its current level in hitroll/damroll,
or +10, whichever is higher.  (You may be 1 below max and get a +2 enchant,
thus ending up 1 over the maximum; this is not a bug.) The max is a little
higher if the weapon has a SOLIDIFIED flag to allow for the additional
damroll potential from Solidify.

When used on Aura of Trivia:
An Aardwolf Aura of Trivia can be enchanted for the cost of 1 trivia point
and will randomly add one point of the 6 main stats or 1 hitroll/damroll.
Each Aura of Trivia can be enchanted up to 10 times and identify will show
how many times each aura has been enchanted.

Please be very careful when using this command to ensure that you will
target the right item, as refunds for errors will not be given.

>>    East wing (1625)

Grand hall
  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

[ Exits: (north) east south west ]
     (Magic) A large chandelier, adorned with many candles, lights up the hall.
     (Magic) A deep red carpet runs the length of the main hall.
(Translucent) (Golden Aura) Carrying a tray of tea and biscuits, this servant is humming a lilting
tune.
On the wall hangs a portrait of an unsmiling young lady with her mother.
A portrait of a man in shining armour holding his sword hangs on the wall.
An unsmiling young man in clerical robes looks down at you from a gilded frame.
Made from a deep red velvet, these drapes frame the archways to the east and west.

activity seems to permeate down through the thick floor. The cellar is well 
used and barrels of food, flour and rice are stacked in neat rows. Further 
into the cellar the air quietens and the dust has begun to settle to the

been imported from around the lands of Andolor. Some of the barrels bear the

West wing
  There are many doors along the hallway of the west wing of the manor. One 
wooden door to the north is slightly ajar and a wisp of smoke emerges from 
the room within, carrying with it the scent of tobacco. There is a large set 
of double doors in the south wall that catches your attention and is probably
worth a closer look. At the far end of the hallway is a single door that has 
carvings of roses in the panelling. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles, which are never allowed to burn out. Small tables 
adorned with vases and figurines are placed between the doors along the walls.
Paintings and tapestries adorn the walls above the small tables and their
artwork.

all four walls, filling the spaces between the windows as well. The shelves 
reach as high as the ceiling and there are wooden ladders on rails to access

with leather clad chairs for reading. A fire is crackling in the fireplace in
the western wall, safely hiding behind an iron wrought grate with the Earl's 
coat of arms on it. Large potted plants stand at the end of the shorter 
bookshelves and a stray ladybird crawls along one of the leaves.

Syntax: wayfind                   (while holding a portal)
        wayfind <portal name>     (for in-room portal)

Some nobles of the realm take the time to learn how to recognize the subtle 
markings around teleporters. This allows them to determine the destination
of most portals they will encounter and takes some of the risk out of their
many adventures. Of course, there is no guarantee that a failed wayfinding
attempt will give the destination accurately.

This skill is automatic.

Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat.  100% second attack skill does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round, however- only the opportunity for a second strike.

Library
  This room smells like books, old musty books. Solid mahogany bookshelves line
all four walls, filling the spaces between the windows as well. The shelves 
reach as high as the ceiling and there are wooden ladders on rails to access 
them. There are some smaller shelves in the middle of the room and two tables
with leather clad chairs for reading. A fire is crackling in the fireplace in
the western wall, safely hiding behind an iron wrought grate with the Earl's 
coat of arms on it. Large potted plants stand at the end of the shorter 
bookshelves and a stray ladybird crawls along one of the leaves.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

     A mug of Bailey's finest sits here.
     (Magic) (Glow) (Hum) A sense of overlooking greed hovers here.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza
  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Before a temple
  The temple is made from the same stones that make up the manor itself. The 
temple is dedicated to Ayla, though it is open to all who seek peace and 
solitude. There are three low, flat bluestone steps leading up to the temple 
doors, which are made from a heavy wood and have large iron rings to open 
them outwards. On the walls either side of the door, ivy grows quite 
prolifically, the vines clinging to the stony surface.

  The foyer of the temple is cool and dim, allowing you to reflect on your time

behind glass, on pedestals to the left and right of the main doors. A white 
pillar candle, large enough to need three wicks, sits in each of the two 
arched niches, to the left and right of the inner temple door. Below each 
candle is a bronze plate, with offerings of gold and flowers, for the 
resident goddess, Ayla.

She smiles down the length of the temple, both benevolently and 
compassionately, where those who enter the temple can take comfort in her

Wooden pews
  At the front section of the pews you can see more of the temple. To the north
is a secluded alcove, with a wooden screen, which has been folded back 
against the wall, revealing two comfortable chairs. To the south is an alcove
with many candles burning in niches in the walls. To the north you can see 
the altar behind the pedestal, which is covered with fruit, flowers and 
plates of jewellery and gold. In the front pew is an old man, white beard 
flowing down his chest. He does not notice your presence, his eyes staring up
at the large tapestry of Ayla, hanging on the back wall, his lips moving 
ceaselessly in a never ending prayer to the goddess.

  There are many wooden pews in the temple to choose from for quiet prayer and 
reflection. Some of these pews have occupants, who have come for their own 
varied reasons, to pray to Ayla for comfort and peace. There is an old couple
sitting in the back row, their hands clasped tightly in each other's as they 
seek comfort in their time of prayer. There is a young lady, with a bunch of 
yellow daisies in her hand, weeping quietly towards the middle of the temple.
At the far end is a raised dais, upon which a large book sits on a simple 
wooden pedestal.

  The foyer of the temple is cool and dim, allowing you to reflect on your time
here, whether coming or going. There are some ancient scrolls, situated 
behind glass, on pedestals to the left and right of the main doors. A white 
pillar candle, large enough to need three wicks, sits in each of the two 
arched niches, to the left and right of the inner temple door. Below each 
candle is a bronze plate, with offerings of gold and flowers, for the 
resident goddess, Ayla.

  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to

wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and 
west a path made from small white stones seems to lead around the manor.

  There are a few doors along the length of the west wing, some stand open but 
have little of interest within. Some small statuettes sit on marble and 
wooden pedestals, created by famous artists long since dead. Tapestries, made
by the women of the house, adorn the walls and candelabra, fashioned from 
wrought iron, light the hallway against the night. Polished wooden 
floorboards shine in the light and echo the footsteps of all who walk upon 
them.

West wing
  There are many doors along the hallway of the west wing of the manor. One 
wooden door to the north is slightly ajar and a wisp of smoke emerges from 
the room within, carrying with it the scent of tobacco. There is a large set 
of double doors in the south wall that catches your attention and is probably
worth a closer look. At the far end of the hallway is a single door that has 
carvings of roses in the panelling. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles, which are never allowed to burn out. Small tables 
adorned with vases and figurines are placed between the doors along the walls.
Paintings and tapestries adorn the walls above the small tables and their
artwork.

East wing
  The east wing of the manor has many doors along its length. To the north, 
halfway along the hallway, double doors with glass panels show the room 
within. A little further along is a door in the south wall with a large iron 
lock. Considering the wealth on display in the manor, there must be treasured
items within. At the far end of the east wing are highly ornate double doors 
with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along
the entire length of the hallway. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?

  Noticing the doors north and south of you, you wonder if these could be
the guards' barracks.  It's strange that a fortress of this size, with so
many guards wandering about, does not seem to have any barracks to rest in. 
It's doubtful these will be those either though; they are far too quiet and
everyone knows goblins snore like a storm.

Porphor's Room
  This room is filled with tables and shelves, stocked from floor to
ceiling with various items.  Vials line the walls, scrolls are piled up on
the tables, and various odds and ends lie about.  A well-dressed goblin
picks up one pile of stuff and moves it to another corner of the room, doing
nothing more than simply shuffling the mess and in no way cleaning it up. 
Looking up at your entry, he approaches you.  "Care to purchase anything,

fortress could remain hidden here in the mountain from the people of
Aylor for so long.  Everyone always wondered how the mountain goblins of

were always more.  Guess this leaves no doubt as to where they all come
from.

through the papers and see all kinds of information regarding wyverns, how
to care for them, raise them, and breed them.  Apparently this goblin is in
charge of research or something.  Looking around you see an immense
collection of whips hanging on the walls.  Obviously these are tools of the

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza
  This corner of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is flanked to the north by the
Warriors' Guild and to the west by the Paladins' Guild.  The Tower of
Strength is made of granite, each block individually hewn from the quarries
at Succoth, south of old Lai'Arder, and laid by hand for every inch of its
awesome height.  The Tower of Faith, legend has it, was created by the gods,
thus explaining the light that seems to emanate from every perfect block. 
Peddlers shout their wares to those before the towers, each proclaiming his
swords to be the sharpest or her holy symbols to be the most sanctified. 
Guild Sentries guard the entryways of the towers, admitting only those who
are sworn members of the given Order.

  A giant arch marks the western entrance to the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
When the city was young, an observer at Meridian Square could look to the
west and watch the sun disappear through the arch. But, as Aylor grew,
buildings sprang up to block the way.  Still the arch remains, a remnant of
the forerunners who built the greatest city Andolor has known.  Though the
bustle of the market is all around, the Sunset Arch is a place to remember
those who have gone before, and to meditate on friends and loved ones who
have moved on.  When the arch was built, it was simple and unadorned, but
over the years its surface has become covered with countless names carved
into the rock.  Some are fresh, jagged scars, others worn to near
illegibility, but the stone remembers them all.

The Grand Plaza
  In its southwestern corner, the Grand Plaza is overseen by the Rangers'
Guild to the west and the Thieves' Guild to the south.  The Ironwood Tower
is different from its sisters in that it is built entirely of hardwood,
carved as smooth (and aged as hard) as glass.  The Tower of Whispers to the
south is of a size with the other guild houses, its spires reaching as high
as any of its counterparts, and yet of all the glorious structures ringing
the Grand Plaza it somehow manages to be average.  No signs indicate its
purpose, and it has been referred to as everything from the Herbalists'
Guild to the Alchemists' Guild.  Many members refer to it jokingly as the
Tax Collector's Guild, but few doubt that the building trying so hard not to
be noticed is the Thieves' Guild.  Lookouts make sure only members can gain
entry to the towers, and the typical array of vendors and sellswords mill
about offering various goods and services.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.  

[ Exits: north east south west ]

>>    *[NOEXP]* Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

Last Updated  : 2023-02-25 11:09:18.

Syntax:  tpspend <option>  (See below.)

For many of the options available with trivia points, mobs have been
specially coded in Aylor that will take care of things for you without
needing to see an imm. Read 'help trivia points' for information on other
trivia point spending options and for a list of ways to get trivia points.

The 'tpspend' command allows you to spend trivia points at the Ravi
Enterprises office, which is located within the Aylorian Temple of Ivar,
north of recall. (runto ravi)

The following options are available through the tpspend command:

(Please be careful to check the syntax when using this command.  Refunds
will not be given.)

aura is the Aura of Trivia (see 'help aura of trivia'). (6TP) 

bag is the Trivia Sleeping Bag (see 'help sleeping bag'). (15TP)

bcp will give you a chaos portal ingredient.  There is a very rare 
chance this ingredient will be silver, platinum, or diamond.  (See 'help 
cptypes' for more information.) (5TP)

corpse will bring all retrievable corpses in the game to you. (1TP)

name <item> <keyword> adds a keyword to an item at a cost of 1 tp.  
The item must be in inventory, not worn or in a container.  Do not use 
color codes- this is the 'use' names, not the 'look at' descriptions.  See 
'help strings'. (1TP)

potion is the trivia spellup potion (level 220 sanctuary plus all three
Imm spells (see below)). (2TP)

remarry will remove your marriage timer, allowing you to immediately 
be able to marry again, removing the 'thirty day or remort/tier' 
restriction. (10TP)

restore will restore your hp/mana/moves to full.  (Contact an Imm to do
a global restore, which restores all players.) (2TP)

sex will permanently change your gender. Make sure you are not under
any other sex-changing affects; see 'help sex' for more information. (5TP)

spellup is the trivia spell-up cast directly on your character.  It will
include sanctuary, combat mind, bless, fly, divine faith, and one of the
three random Imm spells (see below). (1TP)

token removes a trivia point from your character and adds a trivia 
point token to your inventory.  It costs 100,000 gold coins to convert a 
trivia point into a token.  See 'help trivia token' for more details.  
(Note, this command is logged; transferring trivia points to an alt is 
considered multiplaying and against the rules- see 'help multiplaying'.)
(100,000 gold)

Imm spells include Valgard's Might, Shifty's Sleight of Hand, and Creator's
Wisdom.  If you are already affected by the random Imm spell that is cast
during the trivia spell-up, it is wasted; you do not get a different spell
instead.

The owner of an Aura of Trivia may sell it for two trivia points by visiting
Ravi in Aylor and using the syntax 'tpspend sell aura'.

Various other trivia functions can be carried out at specialized stores run
by Ivar Enterprises.  (See 'help trivia points' for more explanations and
related help files.)  These shops are located in the west plaza off
Starlight Way:

Add/change weapon flags         : The Aylorian Enchantment Clinic
Add/change/remove item flags    : Ivar's Item Remodeling

Eastern Yvan Park
  This park, while well groomed, is far from the pride of Aylor.  The
nobles that live here care very little about what could be a great monument
to the days of yore, when dragons were feared instead of slaughtered, and
there was no place for one to be chained to the ground like a trophy.  Aylor
is indeed a grand city.  This, unfortunately, is an example of the grand
being grim.

temple.  By approaching it, you trigger a magical spell that encompasses the
podium and everything near it in a soft golden glow to draw and keep the
attention of onlookers.  There is a small cupboard door on the backside
of the lecturn before you.  It is trimmed with gold at its edges.  Behind
you, a shrouded door hides a small back room for private ceremonies.

In the Back of the Aylorian Temple (G)
  Standing in the back of the Temple of Aylor, one can truly appreciate
its unique structure and design.  The white marble walls and floor blend
together, accented by black pews, altar, and pulpit.  The blood-red candles
around the room seem calming but almost foreboding.  The windows, accented
in gold, are brightly painted to portray handsome yet intimidating scenes.
A large, white and gold statue of a man monuments the front of the room. 
The statue stands taller than 20 feet in the temple's vaulted ceiling.

The temple's altar stands to the north, with the exit into Aylor to the south. 
A small black doorway stands in the distance to the west.

tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Beach
  You see a beautiful tropical beach.  Exotic birds sing in melody.  To the
east is a small shack with a faded sign.  To the west is a hut made of logs
and sticks.  North lies what looks like a stone age village.  You scuffle
the sand and see a depression.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Forest path
  From the dense forested trail to the east, you reach a clearing and find that
the trail has broadened. You were told that the small country town of 
Dortmund was somewhere near here. Looking farther down the trail you think 
you can make out some buildings. Maybe you were closer to Dortmund than you 
thought. Word has it they have work for adventurers here. Hopefully that's 
true because you're in need of some gold and hoping to make a name for 
yourself.

The dirt path
  Stepping out of the woodline you find yourself standing on a narrow dirt
path leading through what looks to be a shanty town.  A few larger buildings
rise up giving you the feeling that there is some business here, but not
many people seem to be moving around from what you can see.  To the south
you notice a long building where a sign hangs- Samuel the woodcutter.  This
must be where the resident wood worker lives.  Perhaps he can tell you more
about this sleepy town.

  Walking along the road it begins to widen out and you can see several log

closed in the breeze.  Several windows have been broken out as well and some

The dirt path
  Stepping out of the woodline you find yourself standing on a narrow dirt
path leading through what looks to be a shanty town.  A few larger buildings
rise up giving you the feeling that there is some business here, but not
many people seem to be moving around from what you can see.  To the south
you notice a long building where a sign hangs- Samuel the woodcutter.  This
must be where the resident wood worker lives.  Perhaps he can tell you more
about this sleepy town.

  Bundles of fur sit stacked here.  Oddly there does not seem to be the
clutter in this room that fills the other rooms.  You even think you notice
a faint drag trail heading north, about the size of a bundle.  Maybe someone
is stealing the ermine furs?  But how?  No one has been seen going in or out
of the factory lately, and there is no way out to the north.  Perhaps you
can figure out the answer to these questions, assuming you can survive the
smell.  Looking around you notice a strange light coming from under some

use smashed to bits and lying in heaps on the floor.  A large painting of a
woman, probably Ole Bessie, whom you've heard owned this place, is slashed
and torn.  Her eyes are fine, however, and you get the eerie feeling they
follow you wherever you go.  Dark doorways lead north and east from here.

  Continuing your walk through town you can see that you're nearing the end
of the west side of town.  Dense forest seems to have grown over the road at
the end, but there may be a path that goes on.  It's hard to tell from this
distance.  A huge red barn rises up to the south of here and you think you
can make out the noise of some animals.  Maybe the farmer is home and can
answer a few questions about the town.

  You have reached the end of the dirt road to the west side of the town. 
Farther west you can make out a narrow forest path that seems to continue on
for a ways.  To the north there appears to be some type of fenced-in field;
you can tell that there are various types of vegetable growing in it.  To
the south you see a sturdy cabin and the smell of bacon and eggs cooking
gently over a fire makes your mouth water.

  Stepping through the woodline, you find yourself standing on a thin

ermine.  The forest quickly grows dark and thick around you here, and to the

  The trail seems to end here.  The forest grows together so thickly that
it would take twenty men with axes to clear any kind of a path through here.
Standing still and listening to the sounds of the woods sends a shiver up
your spine.  The feeling of aloneness, not fear, heightens your senses.  You
realize then that there are many animals here, waiting, watching, to see
what you, a new intruder, are here to do.  You are just about to leave when
you notice a faint trail behind a tree, leading west... maybe it's not as
overgrown as you first thought.

  You are standing inside the door of the Hide Factory.  A terrible smell
fills the room and you can see tools, tables, and many other former items of
use smashed to bits and lying in heaps on the floor.  A large painting of a
woman, probably Ole Bessie, whom you've heard owned this place, is slashed
and torn.  Her eyes are fine, however, and you get the eerie feeling they
follow you wherever you go.  Dark doorways lead north and east from here.

  Walking along the road it begins to widen out and you can see several log
cabins and various buildings ahead.  Just north of you, you spy what appears
to be a hide factory, the sign hanging over the door shows a picture of an
ermine.  The building looks deserted however, and the door bangs open and
closed in the breeze.  Several windows have been broken out as well and some
of the townsfolk you now see walking about cross the street to avoid walking
near the building.

  The dirt road is quite well traveled here.  Long ruts from years of use
are worn in the ground; however the traffic of old doesn't seem to exist
today.  West of here you notice a large crossroads that seems to run through
the center of town.  To the south, a rundown log cabin rests quietly.  Some
smoke trickles up from the chimney.

to be a hide factory, the sign hanging over the door shows a picture of an
ermine.  The building looks deserted however, and the door bangs open and
closed in the breeze.  Several windows have been broken out as well and some
of the townsfolk you now see walking about cross the street to avoid walking
near the building.

  Stepping out of the woodline you find yourself standing on a narrow dirt
path leading through what looks to be a shanty town.  A few larger buildings
rise up giving you the feeling that there is some business here, but not
many people seem to be moving around from what you can see.  To the south
you notice a long building where a sign hangs- Samuel the woodcutter.  This
must be where the resident wood worker lives.  Perhaps he can tell you more
about this sleepy town.

Woodworking Shed
  Stepping through the open doorway you hear the sounds of sawing and
sanding coming from the far corner.  Looking over you see a tall, blonde
haired man busy at work on a small tree trunk.  He hasn't seemed to notice
you yet.  Glancing around you notice a small door west to what appears to be
the man's home, and another large open door leading south into the forest
around the town.  Many various woodworking tools lie strewn about here,
along with what looks like a sword and shield in the far corner.

  Winding your way through the forest surrounding Dortmund you get an
uneasy feeling.  These paths are obviously well-used, yet the lack of sounds
is disturbing.  As you continue walking along you notice a humming sound
coming from a nearby hillside.  The closer you get the louder it becomes. 
Well, there is only one way to find out now.  Maybe you can get some answers
up ahead.

  Stirges!  These dreadful creatures are a terrible bane on the poor forest
creatures as well as any citizens that happen to come here.  Some terrible
cross between birds and mosquitoes, these foul bird-like things have a huge
needle-like beak that they stab into helpless victims to drain them of all
blood.  You notice several of them gathering as they smell your fresh blood.
Better take them out quick in case there are more- they are dangerous in
large numbers.

Standing upright you suck in a deep breath of air, amazed by the sight. 
Nestled in a beautiful valley of trees lies Dortmund.  The entire town is
laid out before you, from the dirt paths through town to the cabins and
buildings.  It's quite a small town after all, but beautiful, set in its
green surroundings.  Oddly, far to the southeast of the town you notice a
small cave, devoid of vegetation, sticking out like a sore thumb.  It looks
interesting; too bad there are no apparent paths leading to it.  There is a
path here that seems to lead back down, coming out in the forest just to the
west of the town.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     (Magic) A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     (Magic) Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.

Trees, ivy, and mostly time have obscured the iron gate to a forgotten place.
As the gate creaks open, and you step through it, you also take a step back
in time to a period of political and religious turmoil. The old king is dead
and the new one celebrates.  Amongst the celebrants are those who secretly
conspire against the status quo.  They are the Balmtor and they won't take
this turn of events lying down!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

  Claimed by those who live on the metallic moon nearby, none are permitted
here except by their permission.  It is curious, though, that they should
forbid any to come here, because there is nothing here.  Most likely,
they've laid their claim on this place merely to keep spies away, for they
are terribly secretive as to exactly what they might be doing here.  There
is a large metal husk of some kind of craft among these asteroids.

the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

Before a temple
  The temple is made from the same stones that make up the manor itself. The 
temple is dedicated to Ayla, though it is open to all who seek peace and 
solitude. There are three low, flat bluestone steps leading up to the temple 
doors, which are made from a heavy wood and have large iron rings to open 
them outwards. On the walls either side of the door, ivy grows quite 
prolifically, the vines clinging to the stony surface.

pillar candle, large enough to need three wicks, sits in each of the two 
arched niches, to the left and right of the inner temple door. Below each 
candle is a bronze plate, with offerings of gold and flowers, for the

  The east wing of the manor has many doors along its length. To the north,

items within. At the far end of the east wing are highly ornate double doors 
with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along
the entire length of the hallway. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]

Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You

grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the

Approaching Diamond Castle (1627)

In front of Diamond Castle
  Doric columns of pure diamond support this magnificent castle.  Beams of
light encircle the dwelling, illuminating the crystal with an holy
brilliance and a divine majesty.  You slowly raise your hand up to feel the
outer wall, and despite having been exposed to the elements, it is as soft
and tender as a baby's skin, while still having an untold of inner
resilience.  You bow your head in respect for the castle, and notice a
welcome mat on the ground.  The mat is completely lavish as well, having
been woven with intertwined strands of gold and silver.  If the exterior is
any indication, the beauty and grace to be found within will surpass any
you have seen.

  After opening the diamond gate and entering the castle, your senses are
overcome with amazement and wonder.  Even the inner walls of this
magnificent castle are made of diamond.  As you step across the floor, the
shock of your feet smacking the ground is absorbed, and instead of making a
cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which
separates the rest of the castle from the arborium, and to the south is the
castle dining room.  The castle hallway continues east.

Inside the kitchen
  The various cooks and maids gather together here, as it is their "home
base," so to speak.  You smell so much stuff at once that your nose cannot
register it all: beef stew, delectible fried shrimp, golden brown chicken
...  There is just so much to cook that the chefs have problems keeping up
with it all.  The serving maids are running back and forth so much that
there is a huge rut in the floor where their feet tread so hastily.  A huge
cauldron hordes the space in the kitchen's center, and it is there where the
cooks magically bake, fry, and marinate everything.  How they do it, you
don't know.  The dining room is above you and a tiny door to the west
functions as a service entrance to the kitchen.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Some of these are for sale behind the shopkeeper's counter, while

  A caravan of people has set up camp here.  The scent of wood-smoke
wafts in the air from the built campfires while assorted tents of
varying shape and color have been erected nearby.  The camp's 
inhabitants, dressed in a colorful array of clothing and jewelry,
busy themselves with maintaining the site as children race happily
in and out of tents.  The sound of dogs barking and the children 
laughing intermingles with the other noises of the camp to create
a feeling of home away from home.  A short distance away, towards
the Sands of Sorrow, a pit has been formed into the dry desert sand.
The pit is surrounded by benches to allow observers to watch the 
competition in the sands below.

A Merchant's Tent (G)
  A large magnifying glass along with fine precision tools and cleaning
brushes are scattered across the large oaken table in the corner of
the tent.  Amidst the shopkeeper's tools are well-crafted items in
the process of being cleaned and readied for sale; weapon's blades
or armor's scales half covered in grit, half shined and sharpened.
Some of these are for sale behind the shopkeeper's counter, while 
others of a finer quality await private sale.  Many of the items are 
exotic in nature; pieces discovered and recovered during the caravan's 
journeys.  Along the opposite wall of the tent runs a double-shelved 
case containing books, many with titles referring to ancient armor and 
weapon enchantments.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Around the room, you see freshly forged weapons and armour.  You look

  As you enter the room, the smell of ink from the pages tickles
your nose.  Your eyes adjust to the light in the room. Candles
are on every table, giving the room a warm and inviting glow.
Smoke rises from some of the candles to swirl and form a Sign.
 
Comfortable chairs are in the corners, just perfect for curling
up to read the vast tomes of knowledge stored within these walls.
The only sound being heard is the sound of soft whispers and pages
turning.
 
As you stroll around the store and peek at the contents of the
shelves you see such classics as Homer's the Illiad, and the Odyssey,
and the new soon-to-be-classics, from the personal library of Tefnut,
ruler of Alexandria, and cousin of Eurystheus, King of Mycenae.
 
Finally, you find the storekeeper, Imhotep, and ask him for help
finding that rare treasure you came in for.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  It takes you only a few seconds to realise that this is no ordinary temple 
building. There is a constant flow in and out of the temple of people and 
goods. As you watch, a shipment of shining white plate armor is carted into 
the temple doors. Not long after, a group of noble knights exit the temple 
accompanied by the blare of trumpets to honor the start of a new crusade 
against evil. You notice a friendly knight standing near the large arch 
leading into the temple who appears to be directing all newcomers to various 
sections of the temple. You are convinced that your stay here will be a

near the end of the hallway you wonder what strange power dwells in this 
place. Perhaps it is simply a figment of your imagination, brought on by the

The Meeting of Many Paths
  Leaving the temple behind, you travel north for a short while.  Here, on
the outskirts of the domain of the Crusaders you find yourself faced with a
choice of several paths.  Directly north of here is a vast ocean and sandy
beach, with the Jungles of Verume visible in the distance.  A well-trodden
dirt path leads down a valley to the west, arriving at a dock where a small
sloop gets ready to sail for Diamond Soul Revelation.  To the east an old
mine shaft into the ground is lit by lanterns.  It ends up in the Underdark.
A steep trail goes up to Storm Mountain, while a downward winding path will
take you through a mist-ridden valley to War of the Wizards.  A gentle and
cool breeze blows through your hair from the south, and you look back to see
the glorious Crusader Temple in the distance.  You feel refreshed and ready
for whichever path you choose.

pulses warmly with holy power and is an immaculate testament

  Upon entering the room, you notice the friendly old knight look up from his 
work and smile warmly. He holds in his hand a pair of sturdy leggings 
embossed with the symbol of a young Crusader. He beckons you to come closer 
and try on a few pieces of the equipment he has made. As you start to make 
your way over to his table you take notice of the other squires trying out 
their new equipment and bragging of their bravery. Somehow taking your first 
steps into this room brings you a sense of peace, calm, and honor that you've
never felt. As you pick up a piece of armour eagerly awaiting its first 
owner, you feel that you are finally home.

  As you look around the hall, you notice the finely crafted walls of white 
marble. Within the patterns of the opaque stone you glimpse images of past 
Crusaders. They seem to be speaking words of truth and wisdom to you. As you 
near the end of the hallway you wonder what strange power dwells in this 
place. Perhaps it is simply a figment of your imagination, brought on by the 
sacred aura that fills these corridors.

are sounds of quiet, constant footsteps. Kneeling to touch the plush carpet 
here, you watch the pattern distort as your armoured hand passes across the 
nap. First the green and blue of undisturbed fields and a calm horizon, then 
rust and navy, like a battlefield under the sorrowing sky. Which now, which

Pharmacy of Sir Richard
  Your nostrils are assaulted with the aroma of a multitude of herbs!  A
large wooden table stands at one side where contented acolytes work
diligently with mortar and pestle, mixing potions from roots, herbs and
fruit.  You recognise rough-skinned mepple berries, the acrid sloughwort and
purple hockstem, but others are new to you.  Fortunately an open window
permits a gentle breeze, carrying the sound of serene chanting from the
acolytes tending the gardens.  You can also hear the sounds of a workshop. 
A single item of decoration in this austere room is a frieze depicting a
tale from the scriptures.  The Nameless One defending the farmers and
artisans of Sleen from the hordes of Mabrok, while his acolytes redistribute
the bounty of the earth among the needy.  A stone arch in the east wall
leads back to a majestic hallway.

The Carpeted Hallway
  You slow as you enter this hallway, suddenly aware of the thick covering 
beneath your feet. To the west a dull glint of gold emerges and to the east 
are sounds of quiet, constant footsteps. Kneeling to touch the plush carpet 
here, you watch the pattern distort as your armoured hand passes across the 
nap. First the green and blue of undisturbed fields and a calm horizon, then 
rust and navy, like a battlefield under the sorrowing sky. Which now, which 
then? Which to come?

The Meeting of Many Paths
  Leaving the temple behind, you travel north for a short while.  Here, on
the outskirts of the domain of the Crusaders you find yourself faced with a
choice of several paths.  Directly north of here is a vast ocean and sandy
beach, with the Jungles of Verume visible in the distance.  A well-trodden
dirt path leads down a valley to the west, arriving at a dock where a small
sloop gets ready to sail for Diamond Soul Revelation.  To the east an old
mine shaft into the ground is lit by lanterns.  It ends up in the Underdark.
A steep trail goes up to Storm Mountain, while a downward winding path will
take you through a mist-ridden valley to War of the Wizards.  A gentle and
cool breeze blows through your hair from the south, and you look back to see
the glorious Crusader Temple in the distance.  You feel refreshed and ready
for whichever path you choose.

  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.

Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew

Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

Entering the Temple Gardens
  Outside, in the garden, you are entranced as butterflies and moths dance to 
the cheerful lilt of little songbirds. The fluttering frolic leads your eye 
across the carpet of colorful flowers, some seeming to glow, all softly 
swaying in the gentlest of warm breezes. North, through the tenderly tended 
topiary, you glimpse white robed figures seated in circles and practicing 
meditation. Centered in the garden stands a gazebo of leaded crystal.
Covering the seats inside, pure white silk pillows stuffed with down are 
tinted in pastels by prismatic diffractions pouring down from the glass roof.
A single white rose sits on a low tablet in the center of the structure.

>>    A Small Path Through The Gardens
  You sigh with pure delight as you wander along this smooth cobbled path
that leads through the magnificent temple gardens.  A merry brook babbles
along by the side of the path, spilling into a large elliptical pond just
south of here.  A large insect hovers close to the surface of the pond and
with a sudden splash it is gone.  Upon closer inspection of the clear waters
you notice several sleek, streamlined forms, flashing this way and that
beneath the surface of the pool.  You realise that the waters are well
stocked with carp and marvel at the colours that adorn their bodies, from
deep orange to snow white to a strikingly bright yellow.  Surrounding the
waters are a myriad of the most incredible orchids you have ever laid eyes
on.  You stare in wonder at the variety, hypnotised by their beauty.  A
large spidery bloom catches your eye, its pearly white petals streaked with
red, small beads of glistening dew cling to its fragile form.  You wonder
what other marvels of nature await you as you continue your tour of the
gardens of the Crusaders.

  The water gurgles and splashes here as it rushes by from east to west. To the
east, mist rises from a massive waterfall. Schools of tiny fish cast 
glistening patterns through the stream as they struggle to swim against the 
current. The trees closely line the pathway, creating a canopy over it, but 
the trees open up east, toward the waterfall and west toward the tranquil 
clearing, where the river flows into a still pond.

  Golden sunlight cascades through the trees behind, to dance upon the

with the passion of nature's essence.  The rays of light are refracted
around the ever changing water, and convey the purity and serenity of the
spirit of the Nameless One.  The balcony seems almost dwarfed by the 
vastness of the sheets of water, which flow down around it with a rush.
Below, the water falls into a clear-as-glass lake, in which beautiful
arrays of fish, freshwater crabs, and other creatures can be observed.
Occasionally, a boat with a pair of young lovers drifts slowly along the

Temple of the Crusaders
  You gasp with wonder as you enter this magnificent chamber. Beneath your feet
is a floor of pearly white marble, polished to such a high sheen that you can
see your reflection. Enourmous tapestries that must have been years in the 
making adorn the walls all around the room. The Ceiling is high and domed and
has been painted with a depiction of a lordly looking knight wielding a 
gleaming sword of pure crystal, its hilt fashioned from the finest ivory.
Flanking the Knight are six others, all imposing and noble. They are clad in 
the purest white field-plate, untarnished by even the hint of corrosion or 
the slightest scratch or blemish. You look around and see folk from many 
different walks of life who have come here searching for a haven from pain 
and suffering. People who would be natural enemies elsewhere are all here 
seeking the sanctuary of this holy place. There is an aura of deep 
spirituality apparent in the whole area as if the characters portrayed in the
ceiling mural are watching over the efforts of their descendants.

The Majestic Hallway
  As your strides take you from the main entry hall of the Crusaders, you
walk into the Majestic Hallway - the trophy room of the long-honoured clan. 
The first things to arrest your sight are the huge stained-glass windows set
at regular intervals along the span of the hall.  Each window is comprised
of hundreds of individually crafted pieces of coloured glass, and the
assembled product causes you to catch your breath in silent wonder.  The
light cuts into the polished marble with a rainbow intensity, but oddly, the
reflections off the polished walls don't seem to bother your eyes like you
know they really should.  Your eyes, following the mosaiced pattern of the

recovers and you realise you were overwhelmed by the gentle sunlight flowing 
from several antiquated panes in the curved ceiling high above. Enormous

One's embrace. In the center of this echoing hall stands a round table. An 
impressive sword lies embedded into the surface of the glossy rock, stone 
originating from a quarry now forgotten. Along the walls you can barely 
discern several alcoves stretching far into shadowy depths, their entrances 
marked by silk banners and marble effigies. Breathing deeply, you notice

  Deep beneath the temple, this peaceful sanctum is a link to the Crusaders
of yore.  Fluted columns of great girth support the vaulted ceiling while
the walls are inset with purpose-built niches, containing remnants of ages
past.  Every recess holds a separate relic, each telling a different tale. 
One houses the dessicated corpse of an ancient martyr, still preserved by
the gentle dry breeze engineered to ventillate the room.  Another, a neatly
ordered collection of sun-bleached bones; the remains of a heroine retrieved
long after her final desert campaign had left her in the embrace of The
Nameless One.  In the next, a beautiful elven mage, whose serene appearance
could be mistaken for sleep, lying in her enchanted crystalline coffin. 
Further on, a mummified half-griffon priest laid out in an open granite
sarcophagus.  Other niches contain less macabre remains.  Once splendid
flags and age-yellowed garments worn by past champions of the Crusaders hang
crumbling as silent testimony to their passing.  Ornate chests and
containers hold tattered parchments, ancient letters and texts, too fragile
to be examined.  Significant weapons from the first founding lie sheathed
within the banners of their original wielders.  Many vacant alcoves await
the recovery of further artifacts, the subjects of holy quests for the
current Crusaders...

gleaming sword of pure crystal, its hilt fashioned from the finest ivory.
Flanking the Knight are six others, all imposing and noble. They are clad in 
the purest white field-plate, untarnished by even the hint of corrosion or 
the slightest scratch or blemish. You look around and see folk from many 
different walks of life who have come here searching for a haven from pain

seeking the sanctuary of this holy place. There is an aura of deep 
spirituality apparent in the whole area as if the characters portrayed in the

  Feathery green leaves brush the aged beams of a doorway leading into the
dusky shop featuring both the unusual and the useful.  Amongst the scented
gardens this curved enclosure has been created to prepare the temple-dweller
and traveller for journeys far and near, ordinary and arcane.  Ropes of
fragrant purple blossoms have been expertly entwined between smooth-sanded
slats while soft grasses form a deep carpet for weary feet.  The air carries
the coolness of the surrounding gardens, the warmth of the temple chambers,
and the hint of the far sea beyond.

  Leaving the temple behind, you travel north for a short while.  Here, on
the outskirts of the domain of the Crusaders you find yourself faced with a
choice of several paths.  Directly north of here is a vast ocean and sandy
beach, with the Jungles of Verume visible in the distance.  A well-trodden
dirt path leads down a valley to the west, arriving at a dock where a small
sloop gets ready to sail for Diamond Soul Revelation.  To the east an old
mine shaft into the ground is lit by lanterns.  It ends up in the Underdark.
A steep trail goes up to Storm Mountain, while a downward winding path will
take you through a mist-ridden valley to War of the Wizards.  A gentle and
cool breeze blows through your hair from the south, and you look back to see
the glorious Crusader Temple in the distance.  You feel refreshed and ready
for whichever path you choose.

The Temple Weaponry
  As you step into the Temple Weaponry, you take notice of the remarkable items
displayed before you. The floor is worn and scuffed by the wear of time and 
the many travellers come and gone. Weapons of the finest quality have been 
set on display, while the Weaponry's caretaker Sir William is busy sharpening
another strong blade. Each item has been designed and honed to perfection.
The Crusaders take great care to ensure the quality and holy power of each 
weapon. Sir William pauses in his work and looks over to you with a 
half-hearted smile, then beckons you to look closer at each selection.

Entering the Temple Gardens
  Outside, in the garden, you are entranced as butterflies and moths dance to 
the cheerful lilt of little songbirds. The fluttering frolic leads your eye 
across the carpet of colorful flowers, some seeming to glow, all softly 
swaying in the gentlest of warm breezes. North, through the tenderly tended 
topiary, you glimpse white robed figures seated in circles and practicing 
meditation. Centered in the garden stands a gazebo of leaded crystal.
Covering the seats inside, pure white silk pillows stuffed with down are 
tinted in pastels by prismatic diffractions pouring down from the glass roof.
A single white rose sits on a low tablet in the center of the structure.

A Small Path Through The Gardens
  You sigh with pure delight as you wander along this smooth cobbled path
that leads through the magnificent temple gardens.  A merry brook babbles
along by the side of the path, spilling into a large elliptical pond just
south of here.  A large insect hovers close to the surface of the pond and
with a sudden splash it is gone.  Upon closer inspection of the clear waters
you notice several sleek, streamlined forms, flashing this way and that
beneath the surface of the pool.  You realise that the waters are well
stocked with carp and marvel at the colours that adorn their bodies, from
deep orange to snow white to a strikingly bright yellow.  Surrounding the
waters are a myriad of the most incredible orchids you have ever laid eyes
on.  You stare in wonder at the variety, hypnotised by their beauty.  A
large spidery bloom catches your eye, its pearly white petals streaked with
red, small beads of glistening dew cling to its fragile form.  You wonder
what other marvels of nature await you as you continue your tour of the
gardens of the Crusaders.

Passing Among the Shaded Ferns (G)
  Following a branch in the garden paths, you pass under a pair of low
hanging, lush willow trees.  It is darker here, under their shelter, and a
drop in temperature is sudden but comfortable.  Large spans of moss cover
the limbs like dark lace, brushing your face with soft touches as you pass
through them.  Passing beyond the willows you see all manner of flora that
thrive in shaded areas.  A dark, velvet blue, Ladyslipper peeks up from a
dense carpet of ferns.  There's moisture in the air here lending a very
slight mist to everything.  You can just manage to catch the gurgle of a
hidden stream somewhere underneath all the ferns.  A series of large
toadstools topped with fiery red caps almost form a circle off to one side. 
Rumors abound that faeries can be seen dancing and celebrating under the
full moon here.  A little apart from the circle of toadstools you see a spot
that looks slightly worn but comfortable.  Closer inspection shows it to be
a thick bed of moss that gives off the rich smell of the earth after a rain.
Intuition tells you this might be a favorite place for couples that seek
shelter from prying eyes in this comfortable haven of living shadows.

The Leafy Portico
  A feeling of serenity surrounds this ambulatory. Great leafy vines hug the 
hand carved supporting columns as they reach towards the ceiling. The nearby 
trees sway in the afternoon breeze and cast dancing silhouettes upon the 
temple walls. Tired adventurers relax out here where their banter will not 
disturb those within the temple. Sitting in an old wooden chair is an aged 
man telling tales of his adventures to the young acolytes. As you walk about 
you hear the crunch of dead leaves beneath your feet, quickly one of the 
acolytes hurries over to sweep them into the garden. The tranquil feeling of 
this place makes you forget about the evil and corruption beyond the gardens 
and walls of the temple.

  You come upon a cobble stone path as you advance into a peaceful grove. 
As you follow the path you observe a small stream that meets the path and
then runs adjacent to it.  Luscious spring grass flows from the bank of the
stream and almost consumes the stone path.  Trees and flowers of all kinds
also begin to decorate the path.  You progress further and notice that the
trees are getting more and more dense.  Now only a few beams of light shine
through the cover.  Some beams reflect off of the stream's crystal clear
water.  Yet others are shining on you and lighting your way.  You round a
turn in the stone walk and catch a hint of a clearing up ahead.  A fellow
adventurer walks by with a look of renewed hope in his eyes.  Whatever lies
ahead has now truly got your full attention and interest.

>>    Grove of Contemplation
  After winding through the temple gardens, a rough cobblestone path ends
at a grove of various trees. Throughout the grove several clearings have
been formed, each covered by a canopy of branches. Most of the clearings
contain equipment used in training the knights of the temple: racks of
weapons, suits of padded armor, and training dummies. Towards the
outskirts of the grove is a small jousting stadium, where many
Aardwolfian knights travel frequently to compete in events sponsored
by The Nameless One's followers.

>>    The Leafy Portico
  A feeling of serenity surrounds this ambulatory. Great leafy vines hug the 
hand carved supporting columns as they reach towards the ceiling. The nearby 
trees sway in the afternoon breeze and cast dancing silhouettes upon the 
temple walls. Tired adventurers relax out here where their banter will not 
disturb those within the temple. Sitting in an old wooden chair is an aged 
man telling tales of his adventures to the young acolytes. As you walk about 
you hear the crunch of dead leaves beneath your feet, quickly one of the 
acolytes hurries over to sweep them into the garden. The tranquil feeling of 
this place makes you forget about the evil and corruption beyond the gardens 
and walls of the temple.

  You come upon a beautiful section of the gardens.  A ring of
trees surround an open clearing, with several benches nearby 
to relax the tired traveller's feet for a while.  The sun breaks
through the clouds overhead and shines down on the soft grass,
and in several of the surrounding trees you can hear birds
chirping.  A squirrel before you stares at you a moment, then
quickly climbs up one of the trees.  You feel strangely at peace
here.

Passing Among the Shaded Ferns (G)
  Following a branch in the garden paths, you pass under a pair of low
hanging, lush willow trees.  It is darker here, under their shelter, and a
drop in temperature is sudden but comfortable.  Large spans of moss cover
the limbs like dark lace, brushing your face with soft touches as you pass
through them.  Passing beyond the willows you see all manner of flora that
thrive in shaded areas.  A dark, velvet blue, Ladyslipper peeks up from a
dense carpet of ferns.  There's moisture in the air here lending a very
slight mist to everything.  You can just manage to catch the gurgle of a
hidden stream somewhere underneath all the ferns.  A series of large
toadstools topped with fiery red caps almost form a circle off to one side. 
Rumors abound that faeries can be seen dancing and celebrating under the
full moon here.  A little apart from the circle of toadstools you see a spot
that looks slightly worn but comfortable.  Closer inspection shows it to be
a thick bed of moss that gives off the rich smell of the earth after a rain.
Intuition tells you this might be a favorite place for couples that seek
shelter from prying eyes in this comfortable haven of living shadows.

>>    A Small Path Through The Gardens
  You sigh with pure delight as you wander along this smooth cobbled path
that leads through the magnificent temple gardens.  A merry brook babbles
along by the side of the path, spilling into a large elliptical pond just
south of here.  A large insect hovers close to the surface of the pond and
with a sudden splash it is gone.  Upon closer inspection of the clear waters
you notice several sleek, streamlined forms, flashing this way and that
beneath the surface of the pool.  You realise that the waters are well
stocked with carp and marvel at the colours that adorn their bodies, from
deep orange to snow white to a strikingly bright yellow.  Surrounding the
waters are a myriad of the most incredible orchids you have ever laid eyes
on.  You stare in wonder at the variety, hypnotised by their beauty.  A
large spidery bloom catches your eye, its pearly white petals streaked with
red, small beads of glistening dew cling to its fragile form.  You wonder
what other marvels of nature await you as you continue your tour of the
gardens of the Crusaders.

  The water gurgles and splashes here as it rushes by from east to west. To the
east, mist rises from a massive waterfall. Schools of tiny fish cast 
glistening patterns through the stream as they struggle to swim against the 
current. The trees closely line the pathway, creating a canopy over it, but 
the trees open up east, toward the waterfall and west toward the tranquil 
clearing, where the river flows into a still pond.

Balcony Overlooking Waterfalls
  Golden sunlight cascades through the trees behind, to dance upon the
elegant gold and silver gilded balcony you stand upon.  Ahead, a
magnificently high cliff spills a wide path of crystalline water, roaring
with the passion of nature's essence.  The rays of light are refracted
around the ever changing water, and convey the purity and serenity of the
spirit of the Nameless One.  The balcony seems almost dwarfed by the 
vastness of the sheets of water, which flow down around it with a rush.
Below, the water falls into a clear-as-glass lake, in which beautiful
arrays of fish, freshwater crabs, and other creatures can be observed.
Occasionally, a boat with a pair of young lovers drifts slowly along the
lake, spending a few quiet moment alone.  You breathe in a cool breeze
which carries the scent of greenery and mist.  This is truly, the
embodiment of peace.

The Stone Belfry (G)
  Small, flat steps have brought you high above the realm and into the solitude
of the temple belfry. Fresh, sweet air now greets you from two paneless 
windows cut into the smooth masonry. To the west, a far-reaching green vista 
is seen, within it the busy city of Aylor. To the east, the land is less 
certain, but the azurian shades of the far sea are visible from this 
staggering height. By evening the view becomes a map of guiding stars, and 
travelers may quietly plan their journeys by the heavenly light. No penitent 
caretaker climbs this tower daily, for the grand iron bell sounds out only 
when an occasion of great devotion, rejoicing, or sorrow has occured. The 
heavy bell, great in size, is one of the few pieces to be salvaged from the 
original temple. A single strike, and an hour later its low melodic tone 
still lingers softly in the ear.

The Temple Weaponry
  As you step into the Temple Weaponry, you take notice of the remarkable items
displayed before you. The floor is worn and scuffed by the wear of time and 
the many travellers come and gone. Weapons of the finest quality have been 
set on display, while the Weaponry's caretaker Sir William is busy sharpening
another strong blade. Each item has been designed and honed to perfection.
The Crusaders take great care to ensure the quality and holy power of each 
weapon. Sir William pauses in his work and looks over to you with a 
half-hearted smile, then beckons you to look closer at each selection.

Sir William looks up as you enter the room and politely offers assistance.

  Feathery green leaves brush the aged beams of a doorway leading into the
dusky shop featuring both the unusual and the useful.  Amongst the scented
gardens this curved enclosure has been created to prepare the temple-dweller
and traveller for journeys far and near, ordinary and arcane.  Ropes of
fragrant purple blossoms have been expertly entwined between smooth-sanded
slats while soft grasses form a deep carpet for weary feet.  The air carries
the coolness of the surrounding gardens, the warmth of the temple chambers,
and the hint of the far sea beyond.

  You have arrived at the Main Armoury of the Temple of the
Crusaders.  The floor of this room is of unremarkable grey stone,
scuffed by many pairs of booted and mailed feet which have 
traversed its surface.  Lining the long walls of this narrow 
chamber is a wide variety of armour of the finest quality, 
wrought by the legendary craftsmen who have supplied the 
Crusaders with their needs for many generations.  Each item 
pulses warmly with holy power and is an immaculate testament 
to the mastery of the maker over his medium.

work and smile warmly. He holds in his hand a pair of sturdy leggings 
embossed with the symbol of a young Crusader. He beckons you to come closer 
and try on a few pieces of the equipment he has made. As you start to make 
your way over to his table you take notice of the other squires trying out 
their new equipment and bragging of their bravery. Somehow taking your first 
steps into this room brings you a sense of peace, calm, and honor that you've
never felt. As you pick up a piece of armour eagerly awaiting its first 
owner, you feel that you are finally home.

The Temple Weaponry
  As you step into the Temple Weaponry, you take notice of the remarkable items
displayed before you. The floor is worn and scuffed by the wear of time and 
the many travellers come and gone. Weapons of the finest quality have been 
set on display, while the Weaponry's caretaker Sir William is busy sharpening
another strong blade. Each item has been designed and honed to perfection.
The Crusaders take great care to ensure the quality and holy power of each 
weapon. Sir William pauses in his work and looks over to you with a 
half-hearted smile, then beckons you to look closer at each selection.

[ Exits: south ]
Sir William looks up as you enter the room and politely offers assistance.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Traitors have committed heinous acts against their own clan.  Performing
actions that deem you a traitor will inform you of such, and you will have
a (TRAITOR) flag appear before your name on 'who' and similar commands.

As a traitor, you will not be able to purchase anything from your own clan
shops, and may be killed by other players including members of your own 
clan. This is the only way to remove the flag.

rocks on a shady path skitter away as you kick them.  The fern is quite
beautiful and you think briefly about climbing it to look around.

(Red Aura) A village kid is here ready to help you count your gold.

Stoned Tavern (G)
  You have found your way to a tavern at last.  Pull up a comfy stump or
rock and order a horn of liquid.  Don't ask where it came from though, you
may not want to know.  

[ Exits: south ]
     This appears to be a drumset made of stone.
     Shapely, long, supple...good sticks.
(Golden Aura) A half-griffon soars majestically.
A nasty stinkin troll sidles up to you.
(Golden Aura) Wendi is here ready to make you feel happy.
(Red Aura) Mickjaeg is here, fiddling with some rocks.
Fred is here ready to take your order.
Fred ducks hastily as the roof shakes and small pebbles rain
on the customers (most of whom are so drunk they don't even
notice).  You see marks of devastation everywhere, and several
larger boulders lie scattered throughout the bar.
Fred the tavernkeeper boggles, "That darned T-rex!  Roaring and stamping
 and causing a ruckus! How is anyone supposed to conduct a business around
 here, I ask you?!"
Fred the tavernkeeper ducks defensively.
Fred the tavernkeeper exclaims, "There's another big one.  You've gotta
 help us out here.  The last three men we sent up there never came back,
 but you look like you're made of sturdier stuff.  Besides, I expect you're
 fast on your feet, all the better for running away!"
A bellowing roar deafens everyone in the room.
Fred the tavernkeeper exclaims, "So, what about it?  Will ya help us out? 
 Give us a bellow if you will!"

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Entrance to the Crusader Clan Temple (G)
  It takes you only a few seconds to realise that this is no ordinary temple 
building. There is a constant flow in and out of the temple of people and 
goods. As you watch, a shipment of shining white plate armor is carted into 
the temple doors. Not long after, a group of noble knights exit the temple 
accompanied by the blare of trumpets to honor the start of a new crusade 
against evil. You notice a friendly knight standing near the large arch 
leading into the temple who appears to be directing all newcomers to various 
sections of the temple. You are convinced that your stay here will be a 
blessed one.

The Crusader Forge
  The area behind the waterfall opens out into a large cavern. Waves of heat 
rise from the furnace at the back wall, while the blacksmiths shuffle between
that and the anvil set in the middle of the room. Water is funneled from the 
entrance to collect in a huge tub, where finished pieces are immersed for 
cooling. Marilynne, the smith works at a steady pace, all the while directing
her assistants in their chores. The heat, the sounds of metal pounding, the 
steam, all combine into an atmosphere of intense industry.

[ Exits: west ]
     A small campfire burns merrily away here.
Marilynne the blacksmith works tirelessly in her forge.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You have entered a warehouse filled with military gear. Heaps of battered 
helmets and other miscellanea lay scattered randomly around the warehouse.
Dust covers much of it, tickling your nostrils, and making you want to 
sneeze. As you make your way down the ragtag aisles you finally stumble upon
the front desk. An old man with one eye stares at you. Better make it quick 
he doesn't seem to have much patience. Type list to view its wares.

A forest path
  The trail seems to end here.  The forest grows together so thickly that
it would take twenty men with axes to clear any kind of a path through here.
Standing still and listening to the sounds of the woods sends a shiver up
your spine.  The feeling of aloneness, not fear, heightens your senses.  You
realize then that there are many animals here, waiting, watching, to see
what you, a new intruder, are here to do.  You are just about to leave when
you notice a faint trail behind a tree, leading west... maybe it's not as
overgrown as you first thought.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

runs across a branch towards a different tree.  A few sunrays manage to
pierce the lush growth of the trees, creating colorful spots on the soft
forest soil.  The path branches towards the east and the north.  Both have
been traveled frequently.

Edge Of The Village
  This is the edge of the village as the majority of the huts lie to the
north.  The hut to the east is inhabited by Milborn the human adventurer. 
Towards the south two new huts are being made, but there is a sign
prohibiting the access to there.  The path here is well used as it is one of
the main entries into the village.

Path Into Snuckle Village
  The path into the village is fairly busy, kids are running around, and
snuckles are going in and out of the forest.  There are no huts closeby, yet
some can be seen a short distance away.  The huts are made out of natural
resources, although no stone can be seen.  They all are a single story high,
with a variety of roofs, some are slanted, some are straight and some are
circular.

>>    Abandoned Pet And Hurt Animal Refuge
  The refuge is placed out in the forest for animal housing.  The snuckles
decided to build it in the forest to give more room for animal care and
extra space if needed for emergency housing of animals in larger numbers. 
Several animals roam the land of this refuge.  Some were abandoned in the
forest by travelers who no longer wanted to care for their pets.  Others are
animals that are either from the forest, or have wandered into the forest,
and were hurt.  Some of those animals were even maimed.  Also the refuge
houses a few orphaned animals.  The snuckles started a donation drive to
keep this refuge up and running.  As new animals come in injured, abandoned
or orphaned, some of the older animals are well enough to be let go back
into the wild.

(Golden Aura) (White Aura) Herberton is feeding a baby pigeon that was abandoned by its mother.
Herberton finishes feeding the baby pigeon and places it back into its cage.

Herberton smiles the biggest smile and offers his hand to shake.
He says 'I really wish you could meet my wife, Finanda, but she is out in the field making sure the
newest members of our family are eating properly.'
A touch of pain enters his eyes as he says 'We were never able to have children of our own, and
Finanda treats these animals like they are our own kids, and to be honest, sometimes it worries me 
the kind of attachment she gets to these animals.'
He chuckles as he tells you 'She would keep them all if she could.'
He goes on to say 'We had a number of animals come in this week. One of which was a small panther.
We are afraid that one isn't going to make it.'
Again, a bit of pain enters his eyes as he continues. 'Finanda is heart broken. She was up all night
and first thing this morning she went to check on the poor little thing.'
He tries to smile at you but a tear rolls down his cheek instead.
Herberton wipes away the tear and composes himself.
He exclaims 'Im so sorry. I didn't mean to ramble on like that and get so emotional. Feel free to
have a look around. But please, don't open any cages. And be sure to read the sign before venturing 
off'

Venturing Through The Animal Refuge [**> PK <**]
  The refuge is bigger than one would have thought.  It would take anyone
days to walk completely through it, and without the wings of a dragon, only
small parts are accessible.  Rough terrain covers parts of the refuge making
travel unlikely by foot.  Animals roam freely in this part of the land,
making it a pleasant view.  Some of the animals don't appear to be too
friendly though.

Venturing Through The Animal Refuge [**> PK <**]
  The refuge is bigger than one would have thought.  It would take anyone
days to walk completely through it, and without the wings of a dragon, only
small parts are accessible.  Rough terrain covers parts of the refuge making
travel unlikely by foot.  Animals roam freely in this part of the land,
making it a pleasant view.  Some of the animals don't appear to be too
friendly though.

Abandoned Pet And Hurt Animal Refuge
  The refuge is placed out in the forest for animal housing.  The snuckles
decided to build it in the forest to give more room for animal care and
extra space if needed for emergency housing of animals in larger numbers. 
Several animals roam the land of this refuge.  Some were abandoned in the
forest by travelers who no longer wanted to care for their pets.  Others are
animals that are either from the forest, or have wandered into the forest,
and were hurt.  Some of those animals were even maimed.  Also the refuge
houses a few orphaned animals.  The snuckles started a donation drive to
keep this refuge up and running.  As new animals come in injured, abandoned
or orphaned, some of the older animals are well enough to be let go back
into the wild.

Before The Wolves' Den
  This part of the forest has lost all magical entities.  The leaves of
each tree are black and dripping a black substance much like tar leaving the
ground treacherous.  There are no animals other than the wolves here.  The
plants and flowers are dying and the trees no longer are whispering to each
other.  There is a sense of presence here, watchful eyes, although none can
be seen.

Thinning Trees
  The trees are smaller here, spreading out more.  Thick bushes cover the
ground between the trees to the east and their vines are tangled together. 
The faint sound of splashing water appears to be coming from that direction.
It appears a small brook runs between the bushes a couple of yards away.  In
the distance a glimpse of a dark tower can be seen.  Jagged rocks line its
base.

Wolves' Den [**> PK <**]
  It is dark in here, although not completely dark.  The only light that
filters into this room is the sunlight that enters through the hole.  It is
very hard to see which way an exit is due to the size of the room and the
amount of light that enters.  An awful smell fills the air.  The smell is
enough to make even the strongest of men feel weak and sick.  Growls and
yelping echo through the den drowning out any sounds that might be heard
from the forest.

Before The Wolves' Den
  This part of the forest has lost all magical entities.  The leaves of
each tree are black and dripping a black substance much like tar leaving the
ground treacherous.  There are no animals other than the wolves here.  The
plants and flowers are dying and the trees no longer are whispering to each
other.  There is a sense of presence here, watchful eyes, although none can
be seen.

Overlooking The Refuge
  The whispers from the trees grow faint.  Plants are losing their luster
and leaves are falling off the trees by the dozen.  Leaves of all colors
litter the ground, although the color is dull and faded.  The magic in this
part of the forest is fading fast.  To the west the colors are almost
blinding, but to the east color is scarce.  Brown covers the leaves to the
east and the plants are wilting.  Flowers still grow here, although not as
well as in other parts of the forest.

  The path narrows here, giving way to the thousands of mushrooms that grow
on the sides of the path.  The mushrooms are harvested for eating, and grow
back almost overnight.  The snuckles use the mushrooms for a major part of
their diet, although they eat other things as well.  Birds are sitting in

mushrooms.

Next to the gate is a sign.  The path leads east and south.  A single

Base of the Tree of Many Colors
  Majestically, this huge tree reaches towards the sky.  It easily takes a
dozen snuckles with stretched hands to circle this tree.  Its leaves are
colored in every possible color imaginable.  Every faerie that comes by here
adds a bit more color with every visit.  This is the main place where the
faeries gather and they treat this tree with respect.  Shay, the keeper of
the forest lives in this tree.

Shrine to the Emperor
  This is a very historical spot for the people of Kerofk, where the wizard
Rand entered this realm through the 'dimension portal' he made, and later
went on to found this city.  A giant slab of earth lies toppled over here, a
strange eye-shaped stone embedded in it pointing at the sky.  A strange
thrum of power in the background raises your hackles...  Remnants and echoes
of Rand's power, evidently.

A sprawling beach
  The beach seems to stretch to the horizon to either side of you, yet has an 
unnerving feel of going nowhere. The sun's rays warm the opalescent sands 
beneath your feet. As the light plays with the tiny grains, they reflect 
marvelous colors back into the air. The campsite up ahead stands in stark 
contrast to the radiance of the sands. As rays of light dance off the sands, 
they cast an iridescent wreath around the camp.

Before a settlement
  Towering beams frame the entrance to the logging camp. The tall wooden walls 
only barely dampen the sound of buzzing and whirring blades beyond. The 
rainbows that outlined the entryway have scattered now that you are closer.
Without the colorful distraction, the walls glisten with their own almost 
metallic character.

Svrogren's saw mill
  A flat clearing lies before you. In the middle of it stands a massive saw 
mill, spewing sawdust as it tirelessly spins through massive trees. This must
be the heart of the logging operation, and as soon as lumberjacks return to 
camp with a harvest, they drop it with the burly operator here before heading
back out to the woods. He mills log after log, turning even the most massive 
of trees into manageable planks of useable lumber.

  Stepping out of the logging camp, a calming silence falls over you. There is 
a sense of serenity about the hills, and as far as the eye can see lies a

an occasional glimmer of axe and sawblade.

Edge of an ancient forest
  Standing at the edge of the forest, trees tower over you. As bark twists and

  As you move further into the forest, an eerie silence fills the air. While 
the chirp of birds and chatter of critters permeated the edge of the forest, 
they remain only faint memories in your ears here. The rhythmic swings of a

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground before you without a hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

  Standing at the edge of the forest, trees tower over you. As bark twists and 
covers massive trunks, it creates fissures that reveal a heart of iron within
the wood. An occasional woodland critter scurries indifferently up the 
iron-wood behemoths, stopping to stare back at you only momentarily.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

  As you move further into the forest, an eerie silence fills the air. While 
the chirp of birds and chatter of critters permeated the edge of the forest, 
they remain only faint memories in your ears here. The rhythmic swings of a 
lumberjack's axe are met with the ringing of iron as though it was a 
blacksmith's hammer on an anvil.

Edge of an ancient forest
  Standing at the edge of the forest, trees tower over you. As bark twists and 
covers massive trunks, it creates fissures that reveal a heart of iron within
the wood. An occasional woodland critter scurries indifferently up the 
iron-wood behemoths, stopping to stare back at you only momentarily.

  Stepping out of the logging camp, a calming silence falls over you. There is 
a sense of serenity about the hills, and as far as the eye can see lies a 
dense forest. As the sunlight peeks through the heavy canopy above, you see 
an occasional glimmer of axe and sawblade.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

Mesolarian Grassland
  Open and flat, the grasslands of Mesolar cover much of the continent.  In
many places, one can walk for days without seeing a single tree or hill. 
This wide expanse of flat land has an abundance of life, however; rabbits,
badgers, foxes, and mice are just a few of the types of animals one can
expect to see out here.  Also, there are many wild grains and edible plants
which the animals and nomadic peoples of Mesolar can easily find and make
use of for food.  Many adventurers should find the foraging easy enough, as
well.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  In this place, things seem simpler and more coherent.  While in other
places, things might seem incoherent or disjointed, everything here seems to
fit together into one simple, connected and logical whole.  The magic of
this place makes it so that one can see into the motives of their friends or
their enemies.  One man who came here was even said later to have come to
understand women, but that account is probably fictional.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

The Grand Entrance to the Fair
  You stand before the gates of a large fair.  A nearby sign proclaims this
to be the Great Tournament of Illoria.  Nearby, you hear melodic tunes
playing, and the mixed aromas of cooked meat and fresh pies fill the air. 
You are glad you came on the day you did - it seems this fair is not to be
missed!  

[ Exits: north south ]
(Golden Aura) A guard stands before the gate, and watches the fair attendants come and go.
The Gateguard exclaims, "Welcome to the fair!"
The Gateguard exclaims, "You'll find lots of excitement here. Don't miss
 the tournament!"
The Gateguard pauses.
The Gateguard says, "I can never remember the rest of my lines..."

  You are on the outskirts of the fair.  There are fewer people here, but
there are still a couple of knights' tents around.  You guess there wasn't
enough room on the main fairgrounds for all of them.  To the north and south
you see those tents, and to the west there is a small inn.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Before the Wayward Alehouse
  Just off the path through the desolate pridelands of Abend, the dark 
continent, the only building within sight stands before you. The walls appear
to be constructed of a hardy wood, though they have not aged particularly 
well, and have several patches of weather-related damage throughout the 
visible section. The building is somewhat dark, though a steady hum of many 
intermixed noises can be heard through the walls. Directly in front of you is
a simple wooden door with a splintered surface and a dull grey doorknob.
Hanging above the door is a sign signifying what this building is. It's the 
Wayward Alehouse! The gravel path under you extends to the west and to the 
east.

>>    *[NOEXP]* A room overlooking the horse pasture
  You stand in the so-called "premium suite" of the Wayward Alehouse. This is 
the owner's best attempt at providing a higher class room for his clients.
Really, it is the same as the other rooms, except with a view and perhaps 
cleaner sheets. There is no obvious light source aside from the windows, 
which seem to have actually been cleaned. A bed, small armoire, and wooden 
desk adorn the room making it moderately livable, if only for a day or two.

[ Exits: west ]
A tired Alehouse patron rests here, nursing a hangover.
(Hidden) This poor girl spent all night drinking and now has to find a way to get rid of her
hangover!

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

Into the dark (G)
  You have entered a room of nothingness; there is no sound, no breeze, no
sign of life whatsoever, just a large dark hole.  This hole is said to lead
to a world of eternal darkness that is sure to drive you mad if you wander
through it for too long.

>>    Celestial Equator
  The Celestial Equator neatly divides the sky into northern and southern
sections, unlike the Fundamental Celestial Plane, which joins the two
sections on the other side of the sky.  It meets the Prime Celestial
Meridian at the Major Equatorial Locus in the very center of the sky.  On
the other side, it also meets with the Antipodal Celestial Meridian to form
the Minor Equatorial Locus, thus also intersecting with the antipode of that
locus, the Minor Equatorial Antipode.

Attic
  Deep in the attic the air is heavier and the temperature is cooler. This part
of the attic is barely used anymore and has become home to various creatures 
of the night. There are old trunks and chests and many boxes stored here that
have remained untouched through the decades. A cold breeze springs up from 
nowhere, rustling your hair for a moment and sending dust mites flying 
through the air. At the far end of the attic the roof rises up and a stairway
leads up to a dark landing.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron

the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and

  There are a few doors along the length of the west wing, some stand open but 
have little of interest within. Some small statuettes sit on marble and 
wooden pedestals, created by famous artists long since dead. Tapestries, made

wrought iron, light the hallway against the night. Polished wooden 
floorboards shine in the light and echo the footsteps of all who walk upon

Attic
  Deep in the attic the air is heavier and the temperature is cooler. This part
of the attic is barely used anymore and has become home to various creatures 
of the night. There are old trunks and chests and many boxes stored here that
have remained untouched through the decades. A cold breeze springs up from 
nowhere, rustling your hair for a moment and sending dust mites flying 
through the air. At the far end of the attic the roof rises up and a stairway
leads up to a dark landing.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to

  Deep in the attic the air is heavier and the temperature is cooler. This part
of the attic is barely used anymore and has become home to various creatures 
of the night. There are old trunks and chests and many boxes stored here that
have remained untouched through the decades. A cold breeze springs up from 
nowhere, rustling your hair for a moment and sending dust mites flying 
through the air. At the far end of the attic the roof rises up and a stairway
leads up to a dark landing.

Mezzanine
  The landing is relatively small and the railing doesn't look very strong.
Sunlight filters in through a couple of shuttered windows, the beams of light
relieving the dark for a few hours every day. An old wardrobe stands against 
the wall, though it is locked and sealed against curious hands, you will need
to find a key if you want to investigate it further. There is a disturbance 
in the air around you and it would seem your mere presence has called the 
attention of the blood hungry residents of the attic.

Aardington Estate
  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron 
arrowheads and decorated with an iron worked coat of arms. To either side of 
the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

[ Exits: north south ]
     (Magic) A stray leaf from the shrubs bordering the estate lies on the ground.
     (Magic) A wrought iron gate is tipped with iron arrowheads.

  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to
the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and

  There are a few doors along the length of the west wing, some stand open but 
have little of interest within. Some small statuettes sit on marble and 
wooden pedestals, created by famous artists long since dead. Tapestries, made
by the women of the house, adorn the walls and candelabra, fashioned from 
wrought iron, light the hallway against the night. Polished wooden 
floorboards shine in the light and echo the footsteps of all who walk upon 
them.

  The attic is dimly lit with only small windows to let in the light during the
day. It is a very long and large room, as it spans over a good portion of the
manor proper. Old wardrobes hold clothes which are centuries old and are 
quite fragile. Trunks and chests contain all manner of treasures and junk 
which have long since been forgotten. White cloths, now grey with dust, cover
disused pieces of furniture. Spider webs cling to boxes and rat droppings 
litter the floor. The attic continues to the east and a set of wooden stairs 
lead back down to the store room.

  Deep in the attic the air is heavier and the temperature is cooler. This part
of the attic is barely used anymore and has become home to various creatures

nowhere, rustling your hair for a moment and sending dust mites flying 
through the air. At the far end of the attic the roof rises up and a stairway
leads up to a dark landing.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Store room
  Deep shelves line the walls in the store room, which are filled with fresh 
linen for the bedrooms and fluffy white towels for the bathroom. Spare 
pillows, blankets and quilts are kept in closed cupboards to be brought out 
when guests arrive. Everything is stacked up neatly and the whole room is 
well ordered. A small writing desk near the door contains a ledger which 
holds the inventory for the room. A set of wooden stairs leads upwards, 
presumably to the attic.

Attic
  The attic is dimly lit with only small windows to let in the light during the
day. It is a very long and large room, as it spans over a good portion of the
manor proper. Old wardrobes hold clothes which are centuries old and are 
quite fragile. Trunks and chests contain all manner of treasures and junk 
which have long since been forgotten. White cloths, now grey with dust, cover
disused pieces of furniture. Spider webs cling to boxes and rat droppings 
litter the floor. The attic continues to the east and a set of wooden stairs 
lead back down to the store room.

Attic
  Deep in the attic the air is heavier and the temperature is cooler. This part
of the attic is barely used anymore and has become home to various creatures 
of the night. There are old trunks and chests and many boxes stored here that
have remained untouched through the decades. A cold breeze springs up from 
nowhere, rustling your hair for a moment and sending dust mites flying 
through the air. At the far end of the attic the roof rises up and a stairway
leads up to a dark landing.

Mezzanine
  The landing is relatively small and the railing doesn't look very strong.
Sunlight filters in through a couple of shuttered windows, the beams of light
relieving the dark for a few hours every day. An old wardrobe stands against 
the wall, though it is locked and sealed against curious hands, you will need
to find a key if you want to investigate it further. There is a disturbance 
in the air around you and it would seem your mere presence has called the 
attention of the blood hungry residents of the attic.

Mezzanine
  The landing is relatively small and the railing doesn't look very strong.
Sunlight filters in through a couple of shuttered windows, the beams of light
relieving the dark for a few hours every day. An old wardrobe stands against 
the wall, though it is locked and sealed against curious hands, you will need
to find a key if you want to investigate it further. There is a disturbance 
in the air around you and it would seem your mere presence has called the 
attention of the blood hungry residents of the attic.

Attic
  Deep in the attic the air is heavier and the temperature is cooler. This part
of the attic is barely used anymore and has become home to various creatures 
of the night. There are old trunks and chests and many boxes stored here that
have remained untouched through the decades. A cold breeze springs up from 
nowhere, rustling your hair for a moment and sending dust mites flying 
through the air. At the far end of the attic the roof rises up and a stairway
leads up to a dark landing.

[ Exits: west up ]
     (Magic) An old wooden chest is sitting here gathering dust.

Attic
  The attic is dimly lit with only small windows to let in the light during the
day. It is a very long and large room, as it spans over a good portion of the
manor proper. Old wardrobes hold clothes which are centuries old and are 
quite fragile. Trunks and chests contain all manner of treasures and junk 
which have long since been forgotten. White cloths, now grey with dust, cover
disused pieces of furniture. Spider webs cling to boxes and rat droppings 
litter the floor. The attic continues to the east and a set of wooden stairs 
lead back down to the store room.

  Deep shelves line the walls in the store room, which are filled with fresh 
linen for the bedrooms and fluffy white towels for the bathroom. Spare 
pillows, blankets and quilts are kept in closed cupboards to be brought out 
when guests arrive. Everything is stacked up neatly and the whole room is 
well ordered. A small writing desk near the door contains a ledger which 
holds the inventory for the room. A set of wooden stairs leads upwards, 
presumably to the attic.

  There are many doors along the hallway of the west wing of the manor. One 
wooden door to the north is slightly ajar and a wisp of smoke emerges from 
the room within, carrying with it the scent of tobacco. There is a large set 
of double doors in the south wall that catches your attention and is probably
worth a closer look. At the far end of the hallway is a single door that has 
carvings of roses in the panelling. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles, which are never allowed to burn out. Small tables 
adorned with vases and figurines are placed between the doors along the walls.
Paintings and tapestries adorn the walls above the small tables and their
artwork.

  This room smells like books, old musty books. Solid mahogany bookshelves line
all four walls, filling the spaces between the windows as well. The shelves 
reach as high as the ceiling and there are wooden ladders on rails to access 
them. There are some smaller shelves in the middle of the room and two tables
with leather clad chairs for reading. A fire is crackling in the fireplace in
the western wall, safely hiding behind an iron wrought grate with the Earl's 
coat of arms on it. Large potted plants stand at the end of the shorter 
bookshelves and a stray ladybird crawls along one of the leaves.

West wing
  There are a few doors along the length of the west wing, some stand open but 
have little of interest within. Some small statuettes sit on marble and 
wooden pedestals, created by famous artists long since dead. Tapestries, made
by the women of the house, adorn the walls and candelabra, fashioned from 
wrought iron, light the hallway against the night. Polished wooden 
floorboards shine in the light and echo the footsteps of all who walk upon 
them.

     (Magic) A statuette from the Realms of the Firebird sits on a pedestal.

  Deep shelves line the walls in the store room, which are filled with fresh

pillows, blankets and quilts are kept in closed cupboards to be brought out 
when guests arrive. Everything is stacked up neatly and the whole room is 
well ordered. A small writing desk near the door contains a ledger which

  The attic is dimly lit with only small windows to let in the light during the
day. It is a very long and large room, as it spans over a good portion of the
manor proper. Old wardrobes hold clothes which are centuries old and are 
quite fragile. Trunks and chests contain all manner of treasures and junk 
which have long since been forgotten. White cloths, now grey with dust, cover
disused pieces of furniture. Spider webs cling to boxes and rat droppings 
litter the floor. The attic continues to the east and a set of wooden stairs 
lead back down to the store room.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

Shadow Forest
  You are in the middle of a dense forest.  The shadows coming from the
trees create a sinister atmosphere.  A few shadows seem to be a bit more
alive than the others.  North and south, the forest is too dense to pass.
From here, a small path goes east.  West from you, a giant tree is blocking
your way.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

in the air.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

(Red Aura) The creepy swamp fiend roams about the swamp here.
(Invis) (Hidden) (Red Aura) (Angry) A silent and deadly mist demon fades out of the mist and

The Blood Swamps
  The smell of fetid vegetation assaults your senses as you step further
into this swamp.  The water here is almost a solid red color, no doubt due
to the large amounts of sandstone and iron that give the rest of the
continent its tint.  Even the vegetation here has a dull reddish hue to it. 
The swamp has more solidity here as it gives way to the plains themselves
just west of here.

  The going is slow in the uneven ledges that make up this sheer mountain
range which seems to perfectly encircle a desert in the center of the
continent.  These mountains seems to come up from nowhere, almost as if they
shot up from the earth in an unnatural fashion, as the land surrounded it
for the most part appears flat and unimpressive, not to mention of a totally
different composition than these rocks.  A small pass appears to have been
made far to the west of here to allow entrance into the desert.

  Traversing the terrain here becomes more difficult due to the larger
rocks scattering the region.  Even the larger rocks have the same reddish
hue that permeates the entire continent.  Among the rocks littering the
area, a large amount of sandstone can be spotted, possibly accounting for
some of the reddish tint to the ground.

  The plains level off at this point, breaking off to the east at the
beginning of a fetid swamp.  The mushy texture of the ground at this point
still shows signs of the same crimson hue that permeates the land.  The
distinct metallic smell here is even more strong as the westerly wind
carries the smells of the swamp towards you.  Somewhere within the swamp a
huge castle raises up towards the heavens.

  The vegetation here is odd.  All the plants seem to have a slight reddish
tint to them, no doubt due to the red dust which permeates this land.  Even
the water here has a sickly crimson color, polluted by the high iron content
of this entire continent, thus giving birth to the name the Blood Swamps. 
Loud cackles can be heard coming from south of here, where a blood red
strata of rock rises from the swamp and into the heavens.

  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

A bright path
  Directly after the animal trail, the forest opens up to a lightly wooded 
path. To the east, castle walls dominate the view. Towers ascend to the sky 
at each of the four corners of the castle. It appears the walls have been 
recently damaged. However, the sounds that fill the air are those of a 
warcamp: blacksmiths' hammers on anvils, orders yelled to grunts, weapons and
shields clashing violently. The path leading east seems well worn, despite 
the western path hardly being able to be seen.

Entrance to the Warcamp
  The gates to the warcamp have been left open, and the guardposts have been 
deserted. There is virtually no traffic on the west side of the camp. Even 
the fortifications are in disrepair. The sounds of weapons being forged and 
recruits being yelled at break up the sounds of the forest to the west. The 
castle looms high above the camp, yet the camp is still safely protected by 
distance. It is not just the damage to the walls, there is something 
other-worldly about the castle to the east.

A path through the camp
  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. The camp runs from the north to the south, 
with tents all along the main path. Large tents lie to the north and the 
west, the latter much quieter than the former. A huge, bright light emanates 
from the southeast of the path, which continues to the east. Horrible noises,

A large purple tent
  Calm seems to have taken over this tent, compared to the camp outside. It 
even feels quieter after passing the flaps of the entry way. Although not the
largest tent in the camp, it is definitely the most lavish. It appears as if 
the mud from the paths in the camp has been banned here, as there is not a 
trace of it. A large carpet covers the bottom of the tent, adding to the 
quieting effect. Piles of silver and copper line the desk in the middle of 
the tent, the only piece of furniture in the tent. An open cereal box is the 
only nonmonetary item on the desk. The desk has been meticulously placed in 
the center of the tent.

path has been reduced to a muddy, trodden pit by the hundreds of kobolds 
tromping through the camp. A giant fire emits immense heat to the south, and 
a putrid smell is wafting from the north. This is far from a pleasant place

  Unlike the other tents, this one is an absolute mess. Vials full of liquid

corner of the tent just to make room for walking. Paths have been intricately
carved into the clutter, creating walkways to the important features of the 
room: the table, a stool in the southwest corner, and a brazier of warm coals
in the northeast corner. Unfurled scrolls, wands of varying shapes and sizes,
and other mystical trinkets are piled high, outlining the only safe passage.
Despite the intense amount of stuff littered about the tent, there is a 
noticeable lack of refuse.

A path through the camp
  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. The camp runs from the north to the south, 
with tents all along the main path. Large tents lie to the north and the 
west, the latter much quieter than the former. A huge, bright light emanates 
from the southeast of the path, which continues to the east. Horrible noises,
and worse smells, radiate from the northeast.

Mann's tent
  The horrible smell from the east is much worse here; this is clearly the 
source of the nauseating cloud. Despite the odors, the purple tent appears to
be almost as lavish as the red tent to the south. Although not at large as 
the red tent, the trophies lining the walls of exotic animals are nothing if 
not impressive. Upon closer inspection, satchels of oiled herbs have been 
strategically placed throughout the tent, to help assuage the offensive aroma
that flavors the air. Papers line the walls of the tent, and you notice
a book sitting on a side table.

[ Exits: (east) south ]
     A dirty fish tank filled with murky water rests against the tent wall.
(Red Aura) Mann, the kobold game warden, is here preparing some slop for the pigs.

  The smell that's been wafting through the camp has definitely been coming 
from here. The putrid smell of rotted food, dirty animals, and mounds of poop
makes the paddock unbelievably unbearable. The poop seems to have been
deliberately piled into the corner of the paddock; the ropes binding the 
animals aren't long enough to reach the corner. Specimens of mismatched 
breeds are all tied up here: a half-dog half-lion; a mix between a lion, a 
snake, and an eagle; a mix between a small bear, a large human, and what can 
only be described as a boar; and the cutest kitten in history.

[ Exits: west ]
     A slop trough that has been defiled by all manner of animals sits in the mud.
The ferocious bearpig here is half squealing and half snort-growling at you.
A gigantic pile of poop has been mounded in the corner.

The end of the path
  The path through the camp ends here, butted up against the wall protecting 
the camp from the castle. The massive barricade wall, made up of giant wooden
spikes, extends high into the air to the east. Any semblance of a maintained 
path has been reduced to a muddy, trodden pit by the hundreds of kobolds 
tromping through the camp. A giant fire emits immense heat to the south, and 
a putrid smell is wafting from the north. This is far from a pleasant place 
within the camp.

[ Exits: east south west ]
     (Magic) (Glow) (Hum) This dirty metal ring appears to have little value.

The campfire
  Shades of red, orange, and yellow dance wildly off of the giant fire
set in the middle of a pit. Huge boulders line the fire pit, gently glowing 
with intense heat. The kobolds around the fire are more wild than those 
running errands around the rest of the camp. There are benches made of huge
logs a safe distance from the fire, though they appear to be seldom used.

[ Exits: north west ]
A very tall kobold stands around, hoping no one notices he is cleaner than the rest.
(Red Aura) This kobold woman is cooking over the fire.

Entrance to the Warcamp
  The gates to the warcamp have been left open, and the guardposts have been 
deserted. There is virtually no traffic on the west side of the camp. Even 
the fortifications are in disrepair. The sounds of weapons being forged and 
recruits being yelled at break up the sounds of the forest to the west. The 
castle looms high above the camp, yet the camp is still safely protected by 
distance. It is not just the damage to the walls, there is something 
other-worldly about the castle to the east.

A path through the camp
  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. The camp runs from the north to the south, 
with tents all along the main path. Unlike the western gates to the camp, the
eastern gate has been well-maintained and is under constant guard. The path 
leading east out of the camp is almost as worn as the main path. The only 
permanent structure, a one-room building made of wood and clay, lies to the 
west.

A small clay building
  This is the only seemingly permanent structure in the entire camp. Made of 
wooden logs mortared with clay, this building houses a kiln, bellows, and a 
large trough of water. In spite of the building's materials, this is the most
sturdy and reliable place to be during the infrequent windstorms that rage 
through the camp. The sounds of the camp are drowned out by the massive 
roaring fire in the middle of the building, which in turn emits an unbearable
heat. The north and west walls of the building are lined with an ever 
increasing supply of crudely made arms and armor.

neatly ordered stacks of paper atop. A lone piece of paper lies by itself on

A path through the camp
  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. The path splits here, one less-used path 
continuing south and another to the east. The sounds of soldiers move from 
the south to the east as two large tents can be seen to the south. The 
soldiers' barracks and sparring arena to the east are swarming with kobolds, 
many of them armed and armored.

kobolds are deafeningly loud to the south, rapping swords against shields 
while screaming. The barricade wall to the east looms large; the oversized
wall is supported by massive spikes. They may be huge, but it seems a bit
much for a siege camp.

  There is no place in the entire camp louder than the combat arena. Kobolds 
are running around the ring in the center of the arena, surrounded by stands
that look down on the arena. The stands prove to be a haven for lost items

combatants, ignoring the training dummies that spot the outside of the arena.
One-on-one combat seems to be the vehicle of deciding supremacy among the 
kobolds. The largest kobold in the camp has been the most successful 
incumbent thus far, and is waiting for the next challenger.

Papers line the south, north, and western walls of the tent, some of which

order, or of chaos, the sheer number of documents seems overwhelming for a 
single person, let alone a single kobold. The chaos to the west of kobolds 
training in combat is almost welcoming compared to the discord found within 
this yellow tent.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Last Updated  : 2021-08-10 21:20:38.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
When exploring Aardwolf, you may find a person with a (White Aura) or a
(Marked) flag.  This can be an interesting sight, indeed. These flags are
actually side effects of certain spells or object properties. The list
below explains what some of these flags mean.

The single letter after the aura name is the shortened version of the
flag.  To toggle whether you see the shortened or complete version of
these flags, use the 'shortflags' command.


Mob auras:


(Animated) (A): Inanimate things given life and thought through magical means,
                under their master's control (thus the (Charmed) aura).

(Angry): This flag shows on aggressive monsters when sensing anger.
         (There is no short version of this flag.)

(Charmed) (C): Monsters with this aura are under the command of someone
               else.

(Diseased) (D): A person or mob with this aura is diseased.  

(Golden Aura) (G): Players and mobs with this aura are of good alignment. 
                   Evil aligned players will get more xp for attacking mobs
                   with this aura.

(Hidden) (H): The player or mob is hiding but has been detected.

(Invis) (I): The player or mob is invisible, and you have detection spells 
             to see it.

(Marked) (X): A person or mob with this aura is under the effect of a
              spell which makes one much more vulnerable to attacks.  Be 
              careful when adventuring with this aura!

(OPK): Players who opt in for Open Player Kill. See help OPK for details.

(Player) (P): Congratulations! You have made a new friend who is not a mob!

(Red Aura) (R): Players and mobs with this aura are of evil alignment. 
                Good aligned players will get more xp for attacking mobs
                with this aura.

(Stealth) (S): Those under the effect of the Oracle spell Eye of Warning
               will see this flag next to stalking / stealthed players.

(Translucent) (T): A person or mob with this aura can pass through many 
                   doors without bothering to open them or look for a 
                   key.

(Undead) (U):  Necromancers sensing undead will see this flag on applicable
               monsters.

(White Aura) (W):  A person or mob with this aura is under the effect of 
                   a powerful spell which reduces the damage taken from 
                   enemy attacks.

(Wounded): A mob with this aura has been damaged more to less than 60% of their 
           total hit points. Help Policies4 now applies. It's important to note 
           that (Wounded) does not appear as a shortened flag. It's that 
           important.

Object auras:


(Blue Aura) (B): Objects with this aura have a divine touch.  Some spells
                 will not work on objects with this aura.

(Glow) (G): These objects produce a soft glow, which allows them to be 
            seen in darkened rooms, and can be worn or manipulated even if 
            invisible and otherwise undetectable.

(Hum) (H): Objects with this flag resonate slightly, allowing them to be
           felt and used while blind.

(Invis) (I): These objects are normally invisible.  You must have some
             form of detect invis (spell, ability, or Aardwolf Helm of True
             Sight, etc.) in order to see this item.

(K):  The object has the kept flag (see 'help keep').  (There is no long
      version of this flag.)

(Magic) (M): Equipment, trash, and even corpses can have this aura. It
             denotes objects of a magical nature.  Some spells do not work
             on objects with this aura.

(Cursed)(C): Cursed items can't be dropped and/or sold. You will 
             need to have them uncursed first.

(Red Aura) (R): Evil spirits reside within this object.  Currently,
                this has no affect on the object or character.

(Tempered) (T): Blacksmiths will see this aura on tempered weapons.

(Envenomed) (E): Shows on a weapon that has been coated with a nasty venom.

Syntax: cast 'disease' <victim>
Spell Number: 65

The disease spell inflicts a virulent disease upon your enemy, that is 
very debilitating. As well as reducing dexterity, the disease spell greatly
reduces healing rates. A nasty little spell, it can thankfully be 
cured with cure disease.

Note: The healer north of recall will cure diseases for a small fee;
however, she may not be able to help you when your disease is too 
powerful. There are other healers around the realm with greater power who 
might be able to help you.

Primary stat: Wisdom, Intelligence.

Syntax: cast regeneration <character>
Spell Number: 146

Through long, practiced familiarity with their healing power, a high-level
cleric can actually regenerate the damaged flesh, restoring large amounts of
hit points and moves to the target of this healing spell.

Due to the intense energy required to perform this spell, the cleric's
magical energy is greatly reduced.

Spell available only to the Primary Class Cleric.

Primary stat: Wisdom.
Affected by : Constitution.


The troll regeneration ability is an improved healing rate, not the ability
to use this spell.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

Through the study of their immediate environment, the character adept in the
use of this skill is able to discern important things about their
surroundings. As well as discovering what special attributes the location
they are in may possess, through attuning to the rhythms of the planet, they
are able to ascertain if health or mana may be recovered more quickly there.

This command displays a list of all the people in the room and their current
state of health. Players should attempt to use this when they enter a room
and suspect that someone might already be killing a mob before they start to
attack it. This command will also prove to be of benefit to grouped players.
To get the status of just one target in the room, use 'study <target>'.

Deep within lies what is said to be the ultimate evil, and also the resting

the Empire of The Far Country, a land of warriors, where the governing tribes
themselves are in a constant state of war.

A Religious interlude
  A short distance from the major crossroads to the south is a small religious 
enclave. An elaborate shrine is built on a pretty property to the east. To 
the west, a quaint cottage houses the guardian of the shrine.

  The crossroads and the local shrine are barely visible to the south. On 
either side of the road, a thick forest rises, and to the north, on a 
hillside, you can make out the battlements of a castle.

Road to a Castle
  The road heads directly northwards, towards an impressive castle on a hill.
A forest bounds each side of the road, and it would appear that the land is 
part of the castle estate, perhaps the private hunting grounds of the lord of
the castle.

Approaching the Castle
  The castle ahead begins to take shape. A round, stone tower holds the main 
entrance, which consists of a pair of thick oak doors, firmly held in place 
by huge metal bolts. In addition, the gate looks like it is very well 
guarded.

  The drab grey stone of the castle almost absorbs the light from the torches.
The sounds of the soldiers grow nearer. Looking down you can see a dark red 
stain on the stone floor. It might be a fresh stain or might be old, as old 
as the castle itself. In the many hundreds of years since the castle was 
first constructed, there must have been much intrigue and even murder in 
these halls.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

The trees that weren't used in the making of the houses and fences were cut
up to be used as firewood for the snuckles who had a stove.  That firewood
is stacked up by the fence so that anyone who needs it has easy access to
it.  The animals roam free in the farmyard during the day, hence the dirt

  The path into the village is fairly busy, kids are running around, and
snuckles are going in and out of the forest.  There are no huts closeby, yet
some can be seen a short distance away.  The huts are made out of natural

with a variety of roofs, some are slanted, some are straight and some are
circular.

Its trunk is so wide making it easy to hide behind it.  The golden leaves
reflect the sunbeams, creating a beautiful scene of dancing spots of light.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Beachside landing
  Waves gently lap at the glimmering sands here, creating a calming rhythmic 
hum in your ears. Just off the shallow waters you see a group of ships, 
seamen tirelessly unloading supplies. Inland a short distance, you spot a 
makeshift camp positioned just before a towering forest. A dim rainbow arcs 
up in front of the camp like an entryway.

  The beach seems to stretch to the horizon to either side of you, yet has an 
unnerving feel of going nowhere. The sun's rays warm the opalescent sands 
beneath your feet. As the light plays with the tiny grains, they reflect 
marvelous colors back into the air. The campsite up ahead stands in stark 
contrast to the radiance of the sands. As rays of light dance off the sands, 
they cast an iridescent wreath around the camp.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground before you without a hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

A dead end in the ironwoods
  The ironwood trees here have grown too thick to proceed. The trunks have 
grown so near each other as to create a formidable wall. The ring of an axe 
is but a distant sound in this corner of the forest. In its absence the
eerie groan of the trees intensifies. It is almost as if they are speaking, 
or plotting amongst themselves.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

[ Exits: north east south ]
(Wounded) (Golden Aura) A sturdy sapling reaches above the others to reach the sunlight above.
(Golden Aura) A towering ironwood bars your way with a shimmering wooden shield.
(Hidden) (Golden Aura) A tall Ironwood is whispering to its neighbors.
(Golden Aura) Barely a sprout, this tiny Ironwood is learning to rustle.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

  These black mountains seem darker then the ones prior.  There are large

The wind blowing through the treetops sound as if something evil lurks here
hunting for anything living to sustain itself.  Misty trail ways makes it
difficult to know which way to go and could be hiding numerous amounts of
things to make the course more treacherous.  The journey onward must be
proceeded with caution.

  Opening the trapdoor in the rocks leading to this room was amazing

Tunnels stretch northwards *inside* of the mountain for as far as you can
see.  In the distance you see what looks to be a smaller mountain inside of
a gigantic cavern inside of this mountain!  Many humanoid figures move about
the cavern ahead; it looks as though they are following stone roads
traveling around the sides of the cavern.  Oddly, the tunnels ahead are not
dark, though you see no torches or lanterns burning.

Path to the fortress
  Moving cautiously through the tunnels, you soon find the source of the
light.  Several puny-looking goblins cower along the walls as you enter the
room, as though they expect to be kicked at any time.  You notice they are
holding some strange slug-like creatures that are giving off a luminary
glow.  Seeing your curiosity, a goblin stands up and places a slug on the
wall of the tunnel.  It promptly sticks in place and its glow brightens just
a bit, making your vision all the better.  Apparently this kind of light
does not hurt the goblin's eyes as does the sunlight.  From the east you
hear a snarl, and the puny goblins scramble to their feet and quickly begin
applying more slugs.

Before the fortress
  Two huge goblins stand in front of two huge double doors.  Goblins are
everywhere here, streaming in and out of the fortress and all along the
roads.  Some give you menacing looks, but they don't seem interested in
attacking you necessarily.  Maybe you're not the only outsider here.  You
notice that the stone roads run around the inside of the cavern making a
sort of system of links, apparently to other parts of the outside world
around the main mountain.  The lighting here is incredible as in the prior
rooms, due to the slugs.  It's amazing really; who would have thought
goblins could do something like this?

  A tall goblin is streched out here on a cot, snoring away.  A desk in the
corner tells you that this goblin is important.  Sneaking over, you rifle
through the papers and see all kinds of information regarding wyverns, how
to care for them, raise them, and breed them.  Apparently this goblin is in
charge of research or something.  Looking around you see an immense
collection of whips hanging on the walls.  Obviously these are tools of the

  Goblin guards walk along the stone hallway here watching out for any
trouble.  Up ahead you notice a guard station.  You stop to admire the
various tabards that adorn the walls of the hallways and notice that they
are not all goblin.  Some are orcish, drow, gnomish, and even human.  You
begin to wonder if these are friends of the goblins or past groups they have
conquered before.

  You're stunned by your disbelief when you walk into this room.  Lying on
a nice bed and being served by goblin maids are the Mayor's son and the
Captain of the guard!  No wonder the city wasn't posting more soldiers and
taking a more agressive stance against the goblins!  When they sit upright
at your entry, you see the fear and worry creep into the eyes of both men. 
They are caught and they know it!  The son falls to his knees and begs you
to name your price while the captain draws his sword and yells for help,
determined you won't live to tell about this.

  Several drow stand about this room.  One is adorned with an emissary
badge, while a few are male warriors and the other two are obviously
priestesses of Lloth, the goddess of spiders and drow.  They seem to realize
you do not belong here and move to attack you immediately.  This is bad news
indeed for Aylor if the goblins have recruited the drow to help!

help spelltags
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Spelltags.
Help Category : Information.
Related Helps : Tags, Slist.
Last Updated  : 2021-03-27 18:09:43.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spellup tags are probably the most complicated set. When you have spellup
tags on, you will see multiple tags with information in each. When fully
using spellup tags you can build some powerful spellup scripts without 
having to constantly check your spells list.

Spell Success    : {affon}72,1650 - This means that spell 72 (shield)
                   successfully landed and will last for 1650 seconds.

Spell Wearoff    : {affoff}72 - Spell # 72 just wore off.

Recovery On      : {recon}15,1200 - Recovery # 15 was added, with 1200
                   seconds until expiration.

Recovery Off     : {recoff}15 - Recovery # 15 just expired.

Spell Failure    :

  Spell failure is the most complex. Here is an example 'sfail' tag:
 
             {sfail}72,0,2,-1 
 
  The format of 'sfail' is: 
   
      Spell or skill #
      Target: 0 for cast on self, 1 for cast on other
      The reason for failure (see below)
      If failure was because of a recovery, the recovery number.

      Reasons for failure are:
 
          1  - Regular fail, lost concentration. 
          2  - Already affected.
          3  - Cast blocked by a recovery, see below.
          4  - Not enough mana.
          5  - You are in a nocast room.
          6  - Fighting or other "can't concentrate".
          8  - You don't know the spell.
          9  - Tried to cast self only on other.
         10  - You are resting / sitting.
         11  - Skill/spell has been disabled.
         12  - Not enough moves.
   
There is a new command called 'slist' that can be used to capture your
skill/spell list for loading into spellup addons. Slist also displays a 
list of recoveries for use with skills/spells that use cooldowns.

The general function of a set of spellup triggers will be:

   Capture master list of skills/spells using slist.
   Maybe capture only learned spells using 'slist learned'

   -- On reconnect/when you need to resync.
   slist affected

   -- Then use affon/affoff tags along with failure codes.

See 'help slist' for a definition of all the fields in that
command.

--------------------- Important Note -----------------------

At the time of writing, the spellup tags basically work but there
will be 'special cases' where the correct tags are not reported.
Usually will these be on skills or spells where failure is handled
in the code for the ability itself rather than the skill/spell
handler.

For example, because 'true seeing' can be recast over and over,
it will never report failure and scripts may get into a loop
recasting it. This particular spell needs to report 'already
affected' when you have all the affects.

Please post these to the bugs board as they are found. Thanks.

  Crimson light, like the ruddy hue of an unseen sunset, winds around these
stars.  And yet, unlike the Zenith trail, it does not seem malevolent, but
restful.  The path it takes runs from Kitalpha, past the moongate, then
north, parallel to Moonwalk until it reaches Kursa, and goes around Sham and
Tseen Kee on its way to Okda, and finally south to complete the loop.  Okda
lies directly north from here, while Scheat is to the southeast and Novus

Before the Keep
  A towering wall stands here. It is composed of large stone blocks that 
form a wall that extends for about 50 yards in each direction before the 
walls turn to the north. The wall stretches far up above you, and is topped 
with jagged, razor-sharp pieces of metal. The only way into the keep is 
through the wooden gate to the north.

[ Exits: (north) down ]
A tall, strange man stands here waiting in the shadows.
Galkorum asks, "Hello my friend. Would you be interested in helping me to
 release some unjustly imprisoned friends of mine?"
 
Galkorum says, "If you are willing to help me, then not only will you be
 freeing those that have been unjustly imprisoned by those sanctimonious
 keepers, but you would also be able to have access to the items and jewels
 that these keepers have kept to themselves for millennia."
 
Galkorum asks, "So what do you say, are you willing to free some unjustly
 accused prisoners and make yourself rich at the same time?"

form a wall that extends for about 50 yards in each direction before the 
walls turn to the north. The wall stretches far up above you, and is topped 
with jagged, razor-sharp pieces of metal. The only way into the keep is 
through the wooden gate to the north.

[ Exits: north down ]
A tall, strange man stands here waiting in the shadows.
Galkorum asks, "Hello my friend. Would you be interested in helping me to
 release some unjustly imprisoned friends of mine?"
 
Galkorum says, "If you are willing to help me, then not only will you be
 freeing those that have been unjustly imprisoned by those sanctimonious
 keepers, but you would also be able to have access to the items and jewels
 that these keepers have kept to themselves for millennia."
 
Galkorum asks, "So what do you say, are you willing to free some unjustly
 accused prisoners and make yourself rich at the same time?"

A White Obelisk
  The grass lies lifeless around this obelisk. It is hard to tell if the cause 
is from the obelisk itself drawing the life of the plants, or from the dome 
of energy between the obelisks. Right in front of you is an obelisk that is 
coated in a white, pearlescent substance, and the energy from it is flowing 
from the obelisk to the dome. From here, there is a set of stairs leading 
down to the dome that you can descend if you want to get closer to the dome.

  This part of the garden is covered in vines. The diameter of the vines range 
from 1/2 inch on the smaller ones, to two inches thick on the larger ones.
All of the vines are covered with leaves of different types, giving them a 
thick, lush appearance. A stone wall can be seen to the north and west, and 
different species of flowers can be seen to the south. To the southeast, four
obelisks can be seen surrounding a dome of energy.

  Just off the path through the desolate pridelands of Abend, the dark 
continent, the only building within sight stands before you. The walls appear
to be constructed of a hardy wood, though they have not aged particularly 
well, and have several patches of weather-related damage throughout the 
visible section. The building is somewhat dark, though a steady hum of many 
intermixed noises can be heard through the walls. Directly in front of you is
a simple wooden door with a splintered surface and a dull grey doorknob.
Hanging above the door is a sign signifying what this building is. It's the 
Wayward Alehouse! The gravel path under you extends to the west and to the 
east.

In the Alehouse
  You are almost in the middle of the Alehouse. The reverberations of chatter 
and terrible music fill the air, as do the haze of smoke and the pungent 
fumes of alcohol. The wooden floor creaks beneath the weight of patrons, 
though the sound is hardly noticeable over the constant buzz of social life.
It would appear the adventurers who have made it out to the Alehouse see it 
right to enjoy themselves. The main walk of the Alehouse extends north 
towards the bar and south towards the exit. There is a table to the east, and
the dance floor can be seen past a railing to the west.

[ Exits: north east south ]
A patron of the Alehouse stands impatiently waiting for a drink.

  You stand in the northeastern section of the Alehouse between the tables and 
the bar near the eastern wall. Adorned upon the wall is a large advertisement
for Aylorian whiskey. The wooden planks of the floor here are rather creaky, 
and are discernible even over the chatter of the patrons and the music of the
house band. Someone unaccustomed to the bar atmosphere may have some trouble 
here while more experienced bar dwellers would find it very homely. The smoke
is thick and the music is loud. The bar is directly to your north.

[ Exits: north west ]
An Alehouse server rushes by, nearly bumping into you as she takes a drink to a patron.
A ratling in a chef's hat stands here wondering why nobody likes his food.
(Golden Aura) (White Aura) A regal aged knight stands before you sipping on a mug of ale.

The centre of the maze (G)
  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

Before the manor
  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to
the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and 
west a path made from small white stones seems to lead around the manor.

Grand hall
  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

  The kitchen is a large and spacious room that is a hub of activity for most 
of the day. A fire pit near one wall has a boar, all basted with spices, 
slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.
A very old door leads down to the cellars.

A dark wood
  Deep in the dark wood you stumble upon a secluded cabin that looks a little 
worse for wear. The trees have grown right up against the walls and there are
some seedlings on the rotting wooden roof. A once tidy rose garden has now 
grown wild and they have spread all over the immediate area, climbing up the 
walls of the cabin. They have created a thicket of thorns that it would be 
wise to stay away from. A large dragonfly, with long gossamer wings, buzzes 
right past you.

[ Exits: north (east) south west ]
     (Magic) A rough, winding trail leads through the trees.
(Angry) The roses have grown so wild here that they have become a thicket of thorns.

  The winding trail through the woods tries to follow the easiest path through,
but over the years, the trees have either grown up to block the trail or 
fallen down to cover it. There is a lot of activity in the undergrowth as 
small animals scurry and claw their way around, foraging for food. A raucous 
bird cry sounds from above you, but you cannot see the source. The smell of 
decaying vegetation is a faint ambience to the accompanying darkness.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Aardington Estate
  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron 
arrowheads and decorated with an iron worked coat of arms. To either side of 
the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

Before the manor
  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to
the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and 
west a path made from small white stones seems to lead around the manor.

Grand hall
  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

  The kitchen is a large and spacious room that is a hub of activity for most 
of the day. A fire pit near one wall has a boar, all basted with spices, 
slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.
A very old door leads down to the cellars.

wise to stay away from. A large dragonfly, with long gossamer wings, buzzes

is a melodious chorus. The trees crowd close to the path, hanging so low

A dark wood
  Deep in the dark wood you stumble upon a secluded cabin that looks a little 
worse for wear. The trees have grown right up against the walls and there are
some seedlings on the rotting wooden roof. A once tidy rose garden has now 
grown wild and they have spread all over the immediate area, climbing up the 
walls of the cabin. They have created a thicket of thorns that it would be 
wise to stay away from. A large dragonfly, with long gossamer wings, buzzes 
right past you.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
     (Magic) A rough, winding trail leads through the trees.
(Red Aura) The raucous cry of a bird echoes along the canopy of the woods.
(Angry) The roses have grown so wild here that they have become a thicket of thorns.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.

A dark wood
  Deep in the dark wood you stumble upon a secluded cabin that looks a little 
worse for wear. The trees have grown right up against the walls and there are
some seedlings on the rotting wooden roof. A once tidy rose garden has now 
grown wild and they have spread all over the immediate area, climbing up the 
walls of the cabin. They have created a thicket of thorns that it would be 
wise to stay away from. A large dragonfly, with long gossamer wings, buzzes 
right past you.

see that it has not been habitable for many years, as the many large cobwebs 
in the corners and on the ceiling, as well as the nest of rats you just

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

[ Exits: east south west ]
An old veteran stands behind the bar, ready to serve you a cool drink.

wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this
