  What was once a large window faces south here, the interior shutters holding 
fast against the heavy weight of sand outside. The window is set back quite a
ways into the wall, leaving room for a lounging area that is large enough to 
go past a window-seat into a window-bed. An empty birdcage hangs from the 
arched ceiling in front of the window, its door broken off and missing.
Soft, luxurious pillows line the ground and the lounging area, the colorful 
silks having faded with time.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Abstract Topological Space - The Demon's Reflection (G)
  Anyar, a crazy transmuter, once stole an entire gallery of abstract and
surrealist art, only to bring it to life.  Horrified at finding the works
she stole animated, the gallery owners instead forced her to teleport them
out into space.  These things now sprawl out across many sectors of space. 
This work shows a man with neat black hair and a small moustache looking
into a pool of water, where his reflection is that of a demon.

with purpose, and some without. The scene is that of the last few minutes 
before the ship plunges forever into the depths of the sea.

You push off and jump onto the raft as it begins to float into the sea.  After being tossed by winds
and waves, you find land once again.

The Beach
  Reaching shallow water, you have grounded your raft to find yourself on a 
deserted beach. The waves lap at your feet, as you peruse your surroundings.
A path through the dunes leads eastwards towards dry land. As you turn to 
secure your raft, you find that it has been picked up by the waves, and has 
floated away.

Before A Vast Prairie
  This is a continuation of the prairie you just left.  Something is
different here though.  There is a mist that hangs over the ground obscuring
the brown, wheat-like grass.  The wind is still, yet the fog swirls as if
there is something hidden in the mist.  Off in the distance, even in this
foggy setting, dark shapes rise from the flat prairie.

Piles of hatchlings
  A large pile of tiny dragons of all metallic hues seem to be engaged in a 
free-for-all wrestling match, with much play biting and clawing and an 
occasional tiny burst of flame or gas. It doesn't seem a good place to stand 
for long unless you are wearing especially thick boots, as it looks like some
of the "playing" would do a fair bit of damage to anything not covered in 
dragonscale, albeit very immature dragonscale.

wingspan, so they tumble to the floor and squeak in pain, then get up and

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Sultan's Walk (766)

The Palace Gate (G)
  You stand before a magnificently crafted gate wrought in solid gold.  You
gape in awe at the splendor of the spiralling towers beyond the portal.  The
ruler of all the eastern lands resides in this fine palace, and he is not a
poor man.  The grand entrance lies beyond the gate, and Sultan's walk is to
the east.

The Grand Entrance
  Nowhere have you seen such an obscene display of wealth than in this
corridor.  The shag carpeting under your feet makes it seem as if you are
walking on a cloud.  Platinum candelabras hang delicately from the ceiling
casting light on the ancient tapestries adorning the walls.  The crick in
your neck tells you it's time to stop staring.  To the west the numerous
halls of the palace begin and the gate lies to the east.

none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Approaching the Camp
  To the northeast, the snow-shrouded bulk of the long dormant volcano
dominates the horizon.  Even at this distance, the fearsome winds of the
upper slopes are made visible through the wisps of snow streaming from the
peak.  There are two constants in this frozen wasteland - the terrible cold,
so intense it easily penetrates clothing, flesh, sinew and bone, and the
wintry landscape, a pallid white as far as the eye can see.  Here and there
a skeletal tree, branches encased in ice, provides some small respite from
the dreary continuity.  A wide swath of snow has been tramped down by the
passing of dozens of booted feet.  It leads off to the east where a camp of
some sort can be seen, a trickle of rising smoke giving evidence of
habitation.

Before the Massive Gates
  Huge black gates loom over the scrawny adventurers, seeking the heat that
the volcano hides.  The slightly augmented temperature is the sole thing
that guides these poor half-frozen souls up here.  The gate is forbidding,
almost mocking in its severity and austerity.  Its sole purpose is to keep
those in need out.  To that end, two burly guards, wielding spears, stand
here and jeer at the pathetic sight the humans portray, occasionally jabbing
at them with their weapons.

Before the Massive Gates
  Huge black gates loom over the scrawny adventurers, seeking the heat that
the volcano hides.  The slightly augmented temperature is the sole thing
that guides these poor half-frozen souls up here.  The gate is forbidding,
almost mocking in its severity and austerity.  Its sole purpose is to keep
those in need out.  To that end, two burly guards, wielding spears, stand
here and jeer at the pathetic sight the humans portray, occasionally jabbing
at them with their weapons.

Entryway to the City
  Carved deep into the side of the crater, this cavernous chamber is a
testament to the skill of dwarven excavators, engineers and artisans. 
Torches mounted in iron brackets illuminate the elaborately etched basalt
walls.  Depicted are what appear to be scenes of battle from throughout the
Swordbreaker clan's history.  In one tableau, Tbir Swordbreaker himself is
shown standing atop a mountain of corpses, holding high a gleaming gemstone.
An enormous flight of stone steps, stretching from one side of the chamber
to the next, descends into the volcano's depths.  To the west stand the
massive black gates, leading back to the crater and the brutal cold.

doorway, forms a makeshift dwarven house.  Perhaps not home to the

and hand prints.  Nearby a worn hide ball, stitches loose and frayed, has

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

On the battlefield
  The ground here is completely torn up.  Whatever happened must have been
a very destructive force to move this amount of earth, probably caused by
magic from one of the wizards.  You can plainly see a laid stone foundation
under the dirt here, and it appears to extend off in all directions under
the dirt.  Maybe this whole area used to be some other building.  You will
have to ponder this strange stone floor later, however; right now you need
to avoid being injured by the nearby combatants.

  This section of the field is a scene of carnage, strewn with animal
corpses, body parts, and gore.  The furniture seems to be raging over the
poor soft-fleshed creatures of the woodlands.  To the west, however, you can
see a large buildup of animals massing for a counter attack.

several chairs and many animals.  A squirrel is clinging to the back of one
chair, gnawing away at it viciously, when another chair suddenly comes up

chairs start to retreat, until a set of kitchen knives show up....

Three massive cannons defend the front lawn, and a stable of warhorses sits 
off to the side. Funny, you think, how, with the grey of ash and the silver 
of mist, a war scene seems fitting. A massive chain dangles above you.

thrumming of enormous power vibrates through the platform, and apparently it 
keeps the platform and the entire prison above the clouds. The massive chain

Dark and forgotten
  
You drop lightly onto possibly the most filthy floor you've ever seen. The 
only illumination comes from your own light source, but it clearly outlines 
the many bones littering the tiny room. Surveying the room carefully, you 
notice that there is no ceiling above, and the only other exit besides the 
one you entered through is through a greasy trapdoor above.

The Magenta stripe on the wall glows faintly and you notice a little Magenta Sign.

A focusing lens glows with enormous arcane power
  
The rhythmic throbbing is louder here and emanates from a free standing 
crystal obelisk that glows more brightly with each pulse. A helpful brass 
placard identifies it a Focusing Lens and the source of Arcane Power 
Generation (APG) for the entire prison. Small motes dance through the air, 
but are unaffected by your movement through the otherwise unoccupied room.

Your feet no longer touch the bottom and the thought of diving below the

slimy shapes all around you, and a hideous whispering reminds you of 
disembodied spirits trying desperately to communicate with you.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

On a busy walkway
  This walkway is made of dark red brick.  It is very wide, with people of
every description traveling along its length.  Doors open off of this
walkway to both the west and the east.  To the west is the feline habitat
and to the east is the carnivore habitat.  Flower beds and privet hedges
line the walkway, adding beauty as well as defining the path and fencing off
the grass.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Razor Spine Ridge
  Blinking in the bright sunlight, you find yourself high upon the slopes
of a vast mountain range and it seems that you are on the rim of the known 
worlds. The wind is chilling at this height and you have a wide view over the
lands below. Behind and to either side, the mountains disappear into the far 
horizon, while at your feet an endless vista of forest stretches on below you.
The mountains are impassable, but there is a trail of sorts leading down from
the jagged peaks and to the south, where the forest awaits.

  The forest floor takes a downward turn into a small gully. There is a small

natural dam in the heavy rains. The ground is damp and uneven, but solid enough 
to ensure firm footing. On the western side of the gully there is a rock face 
and perhaps an opening, but there are too many trees around to be sure. Trees
rise up on all sides of the small gully, but there seems to be a path to the

  Having entered the hidden opening in the rock face, you find yourself in a
rocky underground chamber. This chamber is quite large and has many openings 
leading deeper into the mountains. A deep rumbling shakes the very stones 
around you and loose stones fall from the cavern roof in response. A loud 
bellowing roar erupts from one of the tunnels and echoes around you, leaving
you slightly stunned. Larger stones are knocked loose as, with terrifying 
speed, a giant worm leaps out of a tunnel, shaking the foundations of the 
chamber, challenging your presence in its home.

Dividing Path Around the Lake (G)
  It is cool under the shade of the trees here. The path divides into two, 
north and south, circling the lake. The other side of the lake is visible 
from where you stand, shaded by the trees as well. The water is a clear blue,
the surface reflecting milky white clouds and blue skies. Webbed footprints 
line the muddy shore, the waterfowl having walked all over the place. You 
too, can wade into the lake.

  The water is very shallow here, a child can safely wade into the lake if he

Unforgiving Heat
  A high rocky outcropping provides a perfect wall blocking the stinging and 
grit of the recent desert sandstorm. Surprisingly, the air now is still, 
almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be
an understatement. A long tall glass of water would be welcome but there is 
none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a 
wish.

Customs Checkpoint (G)
  This building was designed to be a customs checkpoint for any
'out-of-towners' to make sure no dangerous items were brought into the city.
However, due to the many different ways to get in and out of the city, the
guards are always either sleeping or off-duty.  Lax to say the least.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  As you become more accustomed to the forest by exploring, the more the
forest lives up to its reputation.  The trees start to blend.  The trails
twist and turn.  And the sounds of the forest become consistent throughout
every inch of the forest.  Soon, there are no more differences in the
forest, and it becomes totally indistinguishable.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is

Before a Castle of Spiders
   As you step into this section of the forest, you notice a continuous line of
 spiders all moving on the same path. It seems very odd... 
 
 Looking in the direction of the path, you notice a road that leads to a
 clearing in the forest. 

 In the clearing is a large castle. Examining the shape of the castle, you
 notice the pinnacles of the towers almost seem like... sharp ends of spider
 legs. Now that you think of it, the entire castle seems as if it was made to be
 shaped like an enormous spider buried in the ground. It must be at least 100ft
 tall. In the front of the castle, you see a cat guarding the entrance.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The hot desert sands
  You stand on the scorching sands of the great desert.  To the south the
endless wastes stretch out to eternity.  To the north rises a large stone
structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north
towards the temple.

  You stand in the north-west corner of the chamber of worship.  The hall
extends into the darkness to the east, and also to the south, where you can
make out vague shapes.  Rotting benches covered in dust are arranged in
rows, where the devout used to sit and pray to their depraved Gods.  You
shiver as a chill seems to pass through you, perhaps the faded power of
those same Gods still lingers here?

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

Gideon's Pet Shop
  This isn't an ordinary pet shop.  There are no cages, only space for the
animals to roam freely.  Birds are flying through the air, monkeys are
playing on ropes that have been rigged up from the ceiling for swinging
purposes, and fish are swimming in a large pond that has been built into the
floor.  Many different types of animals live in perfect harmony here.  The
room is very large in size and although the animals roam freely, the shop is
very clean.  There are several different types of potted plants for the
animals to enjoy, including a few small trees for the birds to nest in.  The
animals here have all been hand raised and well taken care of.

  The waters of Aphasia flow right past the southernmost tip of Minos here.
White capped waves crash against the bleached sand, and the light misty sea
spray adds to the chill in the air.  An oppressive gloom hangs over the
area, and though the sun shines, it gives no warmth.  Yet the waters here
are calm and subdued, as though they have had a long voyage and finally
returned home.  The light breeze upon your cheek contains a slight wiff of
burnt wood.  The smell appears to come from the far east where Melchos, the
ruined keep, stands.  North from here, the ground turns from white sand to

A narrow land bridge
  You have stepped from a land of peace into what seems to be a nightmare. 
As soon as you passed from the mainland to this narrow bridge of land, which
connects Minos with the rest of Mesolar your senses are assaulted. 
Visually, though there is plenty of light, a gloom seems to fall over
everything, casting it in a dimmer light.  The smells of death and smoke
are thick in the air, and here, next to the rolling sea, the scent of spray
mixes unpleasantly with the foul odors.  The sounds of screaming and moaning
come to your ears, though the sound is hollow and seems like it should be
distant.  The land here is still green, the trees which grow along the sandy
beaches on either side of this narrow strip of land are tall and evenly
spaced along the coastline.  The mist from the sea spray brushes against
your skin, and there is a hint of chill coming from farther east.  Is it
really wise to enter into this nightmare?  The rumors told in many inns warn
of going to Minos in search of Asterion's treasure, and all the fragments of
stories in the libraries tell of how the land rose up to curse those
involved in the mindless slaughter.  They also mention that any who seek to
profit from that long ago blood bath are in danger themselves of becoming
trapped in the curse of the land.  Perhaps they are just rumors, but there
could be a lot to gain from just trying.

  The sea breeze on this shore feels like a clinging putrid wind.  You
smell fear, death and hatred all rolled into one.  It assails your very senses
and weaves its way into your armor, seeking to tear you apart, limb from
limb.  The waves crash against the rocks and boulders with a vengeance and
fury, setting up sea sprays a few meters high.  The water feels stinging and
warm, akin to that of a hot spring.  Yet, you feel a foulness that makes your
skin crawl.  It would not be wise to drink from these waters.  Northwards,
the shore opens out into a field, while the entrance to Minos lies to the
west.

The edge of an ancient battlefield
  The ground is still torn and broken from a battle long ago.  Twisted
stumps rear up from the rocky soil and small, twisted trees reach skeletal
branches toward the sky.  A sense of oppression fills the area and even in
brightest sunlight a gloom hangs over the field.  Bits of broken and
battered armor litter the area, most showing signs of rust.  The stench of
decay is all around, and blackened bones are scattered around the broken
stumps that dot this section of the battlefield.  The sounds of hollow
moans and screams can be heard from every direction, and flickers of ghostly
movement tease the edges of your vision; here a Reman Legionnaire thrusting
his sword into a small Minotaur child, there a large bestial Minotaur
hacking into the body of an Elven archer.  This is truly not a place of
happiness.

Shattered ground
  Deep wounds seem to have been made in the earth in this area.  It looks
as if some mighty giant has taken an axe and chopped into the ground in
several places.  The mountains cast a shadow over the lands to the north,
and large boulders dot the landscape.  The smell of salt is in the air, but
this soothing scent of the sea is offset by the acrid smell of smoke and the
stench of death.  The ground seems to be in a continuous state of decay. 
Rocks and soil slip and slide with no encouragement at all.  A long,
forelorn cry echoes off the nearby mountains as a misty minotaur female
cradles the broken and bloody body of a child, whose horns were just starting
to sprout.  A man on horseback materializes from nowhere and charges the
Minotaur.  He runs her through with his lance just before a bloodied form
charges across the broken ground, ripping the horse's stomach open with a
blood stained horn.  The misty images flicker and change constantly.  Faint
screams of pain and triumph follow them.  A chill enters the air and it
seems that even the sun's light is forbidden to warm the land.

Amongst the spirits
  Tufts of grass grow sparsely in this area, fed by moisture from the sea. 
The ground is littered with fragments of bone and metal, and the remains of

the salty smell of the sea creates an unpleasant mixture that goes well with
the howls and shrieks surrounding you.  An oppressive gloom that is sensed
more than heard seems to have a weight, holding you in this area.  Ghostly
figures are everywhere.  Some have bodies torn and broken, while others
scream with bloodlust and hatred.  They beckon to you to join their fight. 
It is impossible not to brush against the thickly clustered spirits as they
relive the struggle fought so long ago.

  A wrecked naval base stands forlornly by the shore.  It used to serve

In the middle of a battle
  The surrounding area is nearly blocked from view by the sheer number of
spirits struggling in their endless fight.  All around are the hollow sounds
of screaming and a distant clashing of arms.  As you gaze around, you see a
large minotaur go down under a rain of Elven arrows; Oddly enough, the
minotaur has no weapon, but instead is carrying a small minotaur child.  A
Reman in blood-spattered armor materializes before you, and screams about
vengeance.  He slides his spear through the ribs of a red-furred minotaur
youth who is whirling a woodaxe in his hands.  The ground seems to still be
stained by the blood spilled here.  Glints of metal can be seen, half
covered by the centuries of dust and grime.  It is no wonder why people
would seek treasure here.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

it is like nothing you have ever seen before.  While the base appears to be
a mountain, layers have been transformed into different shapes as it rises
upwards disappearing into the clouds.  The adventurer's spirit within you is
aroused.  Sounds of fighting filter up to greet you.  An urge to practice
your new skills spurs you forward.

A Rock Fissure
  As you approach the massive rock base, a wide fissure becomes visible. 
From within, various sounds grow louder, sending a wave of excitement through
your veins.  Clashing of metal and muted voices seem to be just ahead.  What
is it?  A creature waiting to attack or an ally?  You summon your courage to
overcome your fear.  Grasping the chance to gain valuable experience at this
early stage of your journey, onward you go.

  Stumbling around in confusion you happen upon a giant tree.  The branches
are so evenly spaced it seems they are meant to be climbed.  Although the
relative peace was a welcome break, the thirst for knowledge proves too
great to pass up.

Vine Covered Path
  Vines twist and curl as if alive. They line the pathway making walking 
hazardous. Roots rise up, in ropey knots, maliciously tripping you as you try
to navigate through the rain forest. The hanging vines almost seem like they 
would be a better mode of transportation, given the rough going along the 
ground.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.
