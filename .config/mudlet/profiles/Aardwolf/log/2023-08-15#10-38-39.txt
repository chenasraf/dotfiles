Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

Aardington Estate
  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron 
arrowheads and decorated with an iron worked coat of arms. To either side of 
the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

[ Exits: (north) south ]
     A stray leaf from the shrubs bordering the estate lies on the ground.
     A wrought iron gate is tipped with iron arrowheads.
