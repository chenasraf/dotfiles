Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

Aardington Estate
  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron 
arrowheads and decorated with an iron worked coat of arms. To either side of 
the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

[ Exits: (north) south ]
     A stray leaf from the shrubs bordering the estate lies on the ground.
     A wrought iron gate is tipped with iron arrowheads.

Before a temple
  The temple is made from the same stones that make up the manor itself. The 
temple is dedicated to Ayla, though it is open to all who seek peace and 
solitude. There are three low, flat bluestone steps leading up to the temple 
doors, which are made from a heavy wood and have large iron rings to open 
them outwards. On the walls either side of the door, ivy grows quite 
prolifically, the vines clinging to the stony surface.

[ Exits: north (east) south west ]

  The foyer of the temple is cool and dim, allowing you to reflect on your time
here, whether coming or going. There are some ancient scrolls, situated 
behind glass, on pedestals to the left and right of the main doors. A white 
pillar candle, large enough to need three wicks, sits in each of the two 
arched niches, to the left and right of the inner temple door. Below each 
candle is a bronze plate, with offerings of gold and flowers, for the 
resident goddess, Ayla.

  There are many wooden pews in the temple to choose from for quiet prayer and 
reflection. Some of these pews have occupants, who have come for their own 
varied reasons, to pray to Ayla for comfort and peace. There is an old couple
sitting in the back row, their hands clasped tightly in each other's as they 
seek comfort in their time of prayer. There is a young lady, with a bunch of 
yellow daisies in her hand, weeping quietly towards the middle of the temple.
At the far end is a raised dais, upon which a large book sits on a simple 
wooden pedestal.

A memorial alcove
  This alcove is dedicated to the memory of those who have passed from the 
living realms. Many small candles have been placed on long shelves along one 
of the walls. The wax from these candles has pooled and dried on the shelves,
creating a stable environment for the multitude of candles that have been 
placed here. A large box with a small slit at the top stands against the 
southern wall. Inside this box are letters to the goddess Ayla asking for 
help, blessings and offering of prayers.

[ Exits: north (down) ]
     (Magic) Many small candles burn for the dead.

Catacombs
  Deeper into the catacombs you can see that the walls are lined with many 
tombs. Both sides of the passageway contains deep shelves upon which sits 
wooden boxes, well-oiled to stand the test of time. Some of the coffins have 
been broken and their splinters have been scattered across the tiled floor.
The former occupants of the damaged coffins are missing, but it doesn't look 
like they were stolen, rather more like they broke through their own coffins 
from the inside as they were escaping their confines.

Catacombs
  A long, low moan drifts to you through the dark tunnels to the south. The 
sound of splintering wood snaps in the background and something heavy falls 
to the tiled floor. A cold breath of stale air brushes past you, enticing 
goose bumps to form. The sandstone walls are cold to the touch and crumble 
slightly under pressure, the grit falling to the floor in small showers. The 
passageway to the south is dark, while to the east you can see the light from
the entrance to the catacombs.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

At the whirlpool
  Finally the water stops rushing southwards, and turns into a horrible
whirlpool.  The more you fight it, the more it grabs you.  There is no doubt
that you will soon be dragged into the depths.  North from you, the
streaming water is much too strong to overcome.  South from you, the stream
goes on calmly.  Above you, you see a large bridge, connecting the two
shores.

The bottom of a deep pool
  You have reached the bottom of a pool.  You see water coming from the
north, but it seems much too strong for you to go.  The water is clear and
quiet and you see fish swimming in all directions.  Some plants cover the
bottom.  You can also see a large boulder, resting against the east wall.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

A dark forest
  Wandering through the forest was a bad idea. Not only is it cold and wet, but
also unnaturally dark. Regardless of the time of day, the forest stays the 
same brightness. Even the sounds of the forest have been muffled by some 
unseen force. The remains of an animal trail loop and twist around, 
eventually extending out of sight.

A rarely used path
  Being off of the main path in the camp, this path is clearly barely used.
Cages hang from giant trees of the forest to the north and the west, each 
containing eldar prisoners. The white walls of the tent to the south flap in 
the forest breeze, as they have not been reinforced like the other tents. A 
strange totem in the center of the path feels like it is drawing magical 
energy from the surrounding area.

  The forest seems alive.  The wind is rustling the leaves.  A squirrel
runs across a branch towards a different tree.  A few sunrays manage to
pierce the lush growth of the trees, creating colorful spots on the soft
forest soil.  The path branches towards the east and the north.  Both have
been traveled frequently.

Snuckle Bakery
  This hut is more of a kitchen than a house.  A large table stands in the
middle of the room.  Various chairs have been neatly placed around it. 
Along the furthest wall two stoves are standing next to each other.  They
provide quite some warmth as they are often in use.  A delicious smell of
freshly baked bread and cookies hangs in the air.  Some loaves of bread are
cooling off on the table.  Next to it is a jar filled with cookies.  

[ Exits: south ]
(Golden Aura) A baking snuckle hums a little song as she gathers the items for her special cookies.
(Hidden) (Red Aura) The daring kid is trying to sneak into the bakery to steal a cookie.

  On Silvermist Road it continually drizzles, painting the pavement dark
with moisture.  To the north and south are two houses.  The one to the north
looks amazingly normal.  It's still quite large, but, without feathers,
slime, or weaponry, it stands out simply by being north.  The house to the
south is a whole different matter.  The southern residence is made up of
jungle trees, archaic ruins, and...  Monkeys?!

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

toward a distant forest of tall blackpines.  All around you is silence.  No
birds sing, no insects chirp; even the wind is still.  Perhaps it is the
presence of the Black Tower that stands before you to the south.  A large
black gate blocks the path directly to the south, and unless you carry the
key, you can go no further in this direction.  Perhaps it is just as well;
this place looks nasty!

find yourself falling down the steep stone stairway into the darkness below.
Looking around you realise that you have fallen into a deep pit. A sturdy 
iron door is set into the east wall, you hope it's not locked, as there seems
to be no other way out, the ceiling has closed up, and you assume that it 
must be some kind of a trap-door, and you fell right into the trap!

are in lined up along one wall, and a table covered with thumb-screws, 
needles, pincers, tongs, branding-irons and other items, sits in the middle 
of the room. This room is obviously where the Yurgach torture their 
prisoners, or just come to have some fun, after a hard day beating the slaves
and killing people.  After a closer inspection, it appears you might be able
to squeeze inside the brazier, if you're willing to risk getting stuck.

In the Dungeons
  You stand in a long narrow room that extends to the east. To the north and 
south are large iron doors, and you see more doors to the east and west. The 
room is only dimly lit, and it contains a strong smell of sweat, fear and 
excrement, as though some animal had been locked up in a small cage for many 
days. You notice that there is a stone trapdoor set into the ground.

  You stand in a large natural cave which opens to the north, allowing a small 
amount of light to enter. The cave is quite large, almost 60 meters high, and
about 200 meters wide. Large stalactites hang from the ceiling like huge 
fangs, but the floor of the cave is worn almost perfectly flat. Despite the 
fresh air blowing in from the opening to the north, there is a strong smell 
of lizard or snake in the air. The walls of the cave are black stone, and you
see strands of metals glittering in wide veins running through the rock. A 
Dwarf would have a field day here! But you have other things to occupy your

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

Welcome to Grandmarket Boulevard! (G)
  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

There is a loud scream and a flare of light shoots towards the sky.
Below the flare, you hear Abraxos scream 'HEAR ME, FOR I HAVE CONQUERED!'
As the light fades you realize a new superhero has been born.
For the next 15 minutes experience is doubled in honor of the new superhero.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Before the entrance to the Underdark
  You stand before a huge door.  The corridor can easily fit fifteen humans
standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

Traveller's Crescent
  You stand at the west side of the city along Traveller's Crescent.  You have
heard rumours that githzerai have been seen walking around this part of
the road.  Glowing orbs in the air light the area around you.  The orbs seem
to be flickering on and off.  Screams reach your ears here, the screams of
slaves being whipped.  The smell of sweat and perspiration is sickly sweet
to your nose, and tangy to your taste.
 
Traveller's Crescent goes east and south.

  Precious books and half-worn scrolls litter the floor, priceless
artifacts decorate niches in the walls, while gems of all shapes,
types, and sizes glisten from the walls.  Because of all the vast
things to wonder at, you don't pay attention to where you are
going and wander around without direction.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Shrine to the Emperor
  This is a very historical spot for the people of Kerofk, where the wizard
Rand entered this realm through the 'dimension portal' he made, and later
went on to found this city.  A giant slab of earth lies toppled over here, a
strange eye-shaped stone embedded in it pointing at the sky.  A strange
thrum of power in the background raises your hackles...  Remnants and echoes
of Rand's power, evidently.

  You stand at a crowded table.  It seems that a large number of regular
patrons have taken this as their regular table, and have all come to have
dinner together.  There is much good natured banter going on, and a fair
share of boasting, and telling of tall tales.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

unseen force. The remains of an animal trail loop and twist around, 
eventually extending out of sight.

The battle path around the castle
  The southern path around the castle is filled with carnage and mayhem.
Scavengers fight and peck the fallen kobolds which have been pushed off of 
the path. The siege has been the hardest for the kobolds around this path, 
without much damage to the castle. Without warning, the ground shakes with a 
muffled thud, followed by mad cackling. Perhaps that sound could be 
investigated further to discover the source.

  A stepladder to the south leads back up to the battle path, where the carnage

the castle above the dark void underneath. The beams are equidistantly placed 
along the tunnel roof, surprisingly supporting the weight of the castle.

  The tunnel recedes to the south, collapsing into darkness. Twin beams have 
been built to the north, east, and west, creating a respite to the endless 
darkness. Rock walls block any exit to these directions. The southern exit 
has beams, but they were much more hastily constructed than the others. The 
southern exit still shows promise of an exit to the tunnels, a hint of light 
extending to parts unknown. A tiny green glint in the ceiling is the only 
color in the entire tunnel. Walls keep the kobolds from digging to the 
extraneous directions, suggesting any exit to the freedom does not lie above.

corpses have been piled into the eastern corner, also covered with dust and 
pebbles caused by innumerable explosions throughout the tunnels. There are no
sconces lining the walls, as light was never meant to shine here. This dead 
end is used solely to forget the mistakes of the kobolds' past.

o-}HooK{-o Shala: There is no public record of any of the members of Pink Floyd ever expressing an
opinion on the anime One Piece. So, it is impossible to say for sure whether or not they like it. 
However, given their interest in other forms of fantasy and science fiction, it is certainly 
possible that they would enjoy One Piece. The members of Pink Floyd have been known to be fans of 
other anime and manga series, such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell. They have also been known to 
reference anime and manga in their music and artwork. For example, the cover of their 1968 album A 
Saucerful of Secrets features an image of Doctor Strange fighting the Living Tribunal, which is a 
character from Marvel Comics. So, while there is no definitive answer, it is certainly possible that 
Pink Floyd would enjoy One Piece. If you are a fan of both Pink Floyd and One Piece, I would 
encourage you to check out some of the fan art and music that has been created by fans of both 
franchises. There is some really great stuff out there!
