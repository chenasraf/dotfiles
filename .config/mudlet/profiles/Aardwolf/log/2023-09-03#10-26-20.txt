Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Palace Street, in front of the gates
  The gates of Arisia's Palace are standing south from here.  This place is
not as big as you were told, but the castle is really beautiful.  The gates
are sculpted in precious wood, and it seems that many precious stones
(perhaps diamonds and sapphires) are encrusted in the gates.  The place is
heavily guarded, and you wonder which treasures this magnificent palace
could hold.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

ship will probably be leaving port shortly. However, the captain isn't in

The End of the Pier
  Here, the cargo ship Eleanor Gast prepares to set sail to the island city of 
Rhodus, its hold loaded down with grain. No dockhands are in sight, so the 
ship will probably be leaving port shortly. However, the captain isn't in 
sight either, which is very abnormal. No other ships are docked at this end 
of the pier, so the captain must have gone elsewhere.

Before the Gates of Rhodus
  The Eleanor Gast sits at a pier here before the southern gate of
Rhodus, the only city on the Isle of Molyneux.  The gate, a white marble
archway with no discernable door or portcullis, is an architectural marvel;
fifty feet tall, every inch of the archway covered with sculpture.  Images
of wyverns and gods of the sea dominate, with the occasional war-clad
Molyneuxan or enslaved human figure.  Drug-pacified servants finish
unloading the ship's cargo all around you, but the strange green
tinge to the sky...

Reimers Avenue by the City Gates
  This broad avenue, named for Molyneux's twelfth emperor, Reimer V,
bustles with activity.  A few Molyneuxans walk purposefully down the
street, while human slaves carry goods and cargoes to and from the pier to
the south.  The street itself is built from a pearly marble-like stone,
faint veins of rose color turning the perfectly smooth expanse of
roadway into its own work of art.  A tapering jade tower stands to the
west, while an uncharacteristically simple building lies to your east.

Guard Post at the Bottom of a Tower
  The jade walls inside the tower have a matt finish to prevent reflected 
light from dazzling or blinding its occupants. This is doubly important for 
the bottom floor of the tower is filled with Molyneuxan soldiers, sharpening 
their blades, stringing their bows, and generally acting nervous and 
impatient. Absorbed in their worries, they ignore you completely as you walk 
through the tower. Other than the exit back out onto the street, you find a 
spiral staircase leading upwards along the inside of the tower's gently 
tapering outer walls, as well as a door made of black stone leading downwards
from a shadowy corner.

The Visitors' Hostel
  No Molyneuxans can be seen within this small building, probably because
its unadorned plaster walls and simple, ordinary architecture offend their
aesthetic sensibilities.  The building was made for visitors to stay in
while in Rhodus, although right now it is almost completely empty.  If you
are feeling tired, and wish to lay down your weapon for a little while and
rest, a warm hearth and passably comfortable bed awaits you.

faint looks of displeasure on the normally emotionless Molyneuxan faces in

undoubtably wrong here in Rhodus, as you begin to notice the increased number
of soldiers on the city streets. Looking around, you see an unadorned 
building to the west, its stone walls tapering with perfect smoothness 
towards an rounded top thirty feet up. To the east, you see a storefront 
advertising the works of a master Molyneuxan smith.

A Granary
  Piles of fresh, golden wheat fill this granary nearly to its ceiling.
The only plants grown on Molyneux are poppies, so the Molyneuxans must
import virtually all the food they eat, and the quality of the crafted goods
they produce provides them with more than enough money to do so.  Slaves
from a variety of races constantly carry huge sacks of grain in from the
docks and out to the rest of the city, under the watchful eye of a bound
demon.

The Metalsmith's Shop
  The forge characteristic of most smithies is nowhere to be seen. This
shop is devoted solely to making sales, without any ugly smoke or heat to
deter potential customers.  Most likely, the actual work of smithing is done
in a back room somewhere by human slaves, with the Molyneuxan metalsmith
interrupting his sales work to design plans for the slaves to follow, and to
put the finishing touches on each item.  Whoever the "real" creator of these
items may be, their quality is among the best in the world.

get out from under this disturbing sky, you see a house made of rare,

A Closed-Down Shop
  Apparently, the owner of this shop has gotten up and left for better
parts of the world.  The Molyneuxans are fabulously wealthy, so whatever
precipitated the closing of this shop, it probably wasn't poor economic
conditions.  The building looks fairly recently abandoned, so the owners
most likely left to get out from under the spectre of the approaching Nixies.

  This home belongs to a Molyneuxan woman who wishes to make some money by
selling some handmade goods.  While the price of such items far outweighs
their durability, their beauty and quality more than makes up the

paintings portraying abstract patterns of color instead of scenes or

artwork, but while you may find them aesthetically pleasing, any meaning

Loredo Avenue
  A cold wind blows down the avenue, sending shivers through your bones and 
prompting you to look upwards at the Nix-touched sky. Here on the western 
side of the city, the green seems darker than it appeared near the docks, and
looking to the west it seems to not only grow darker, but also to move as if 
it were alive... Wrenching your gaze away from the sky, you see the marble of
Loredo Avenue sprout a pair of simple side paths, the southern one leading to
an alleyway behind the backs of two buildings, while the northern one winds 
between two smaller houses towards a larger one, set back against the wall of
the Inner City. To the west, city and road alike seem somewhat run-down, very
uncharacteristic for Rhodus.

from the main avenue, the flagstone paving gives way to broken gravel in a
cul-de-sac littered with dirt and refuse.  This must be where the unwanted
of the city take up residence; the marooned sailors and stowaways, the
escaped slaves nobody bothered to recapture, the maimed, the ruined, the
failed.  Something tells you no such dumping ground exists in the Inner
City.

Loredo Avenue
  A cold wind blows down the avenue, sending shivers through your bones and 
prompting you to look upwards at the Nix-touched sky. Here on the western 
side of the city, the green seems darker than it appeared near the docks, and
looking to the west it seems to not only grow darker, but also to move as if 
it were alive... Wrenching your gaze away from the sky, you see the marble of
Loredo Avenue sprout a pair of simple side paths, the southern one leading to
an alleyway behind the backs of two buildings, while the northern one winds 
between two smaller houses towards a larger one, set back against the wall of
the Inner City. To the west, city and road alike seem somewhat run-down, very
uncharacteristic for Rhodus.

A Beautiful Garden
  Lush green grass covers the ground here, a small private garden in front of 
the magnificent house to the north. Trees overhang the small garden, their 
boughs leaning towards the fountain in its center and providing shade for any
who wishes to rest for a little while. Not that shade matters much on such a 
cold day as this, but the plants look freshly watered nonetheless.
Southwards, a flagstone path leads back to Loredo Avenue, while the 
vine-covered grey marble walls of a mansion make the garden's northern 
border.

The Abandoned Edge of Loredo Avenue
  Here, the blue-tinged marble paving is broken and shattered, and the street 
lies empty and deserted. The sky here is a shifting, twisting mass of 
writhing green; just looking at it makes you feel ill, and it looks even 
worse to the west. The buildings here are all deserted, for not even the 
virtually unperturbable Molyneuxans are foolish enough to live so close to 
the edge of the Nixies' assault. Many of the buildings have crumbled as the 
laws of physics decay away bit by bit, although one house to the south seems 
sturdy enough to enter safely.

An Abandoned Home
  Only three walls of this once-beautiful building remain standing, leaving
the street clearly visible to the north and the sky through where the roof
once was.  Chunks of broken white marble litter the floor, awash with sickly
green light reflected from the sky.  Fragments of wood, once parts of
exquiste carvings, lie scattered across the floor, barely distinguishable
from driftwood.

At the City Walls
  Nobody with a choice in the matter would come this close to the Nixie 
periphery, but a few Molyneuxan soldiers stand watch atop the city's low 
walls. Funny, you remember the walls being taller by the southern gate of the
city; these ones are barely the height of a tall man. Proximity to the Nixie
must be warping matter on a massive scale, creating impossibilities like the 
pile of yellow dust to the south where a house must once have stood. You feel
very sorry for the soldiers posted here, keeping watch on the approach of the
Nixie.

Under a Churning Sky
  No hint of the sun remains visible, the world before you lit entirely by the 
unnatural colors of the sky. It seems as if the sky itself is alive, writhing
in pain as various shades of green slide past each other, between veins of 
purple and flickers of golden yellow light. The ground beneath your feet 
feels soft, as if the Nixie were leaching away its existance. To the west, sky
and land disappear completely in a dark, roiling cloud of formlessness.

Waves of Nixie Devilment
  The definitions of matter break down before your eyes as you step into the 
churning wall of Nixie devilment. A cacophony of sound arounds you, and with 
it, the space in front of you feels neither more nor less solid than the 
space beneath your feet. The horrid sounds batter your ears with hints of 
whispered conversations and crashes of wild thunder. Horrible pain rips 
across your body as the Nixie try to pull you apart, breaking you down into 
just one more bit of stuff for the infinite creations and dissolutions 
through which the Nixie rebels find amusement.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The End of the Pier
  Here, the cargo ship Eleanor Gast prepares to set sail to the island city of 
Rhodus, its hold loaded down with grain. No dockhands are in sight, so the 
ship will probably be leaving port shortly. However, the captain isn't in 
sight either, which is very abnormal. No other ships are docked at this end 
of the pier, so the captain must have gone elsewhere.

Before the Gates of Rhodus
  The Eleanor Gast sits at a pier here before the southern gate of
Rhodus, the only city on the Isle of Molyneux.  The gate, a white marble
archway with no discernable door or portcullis, is an architectural marvel;
fifty feet tall, every inch of the archway covered with sculpture.  Images
of wyverns and gods of the sea dominate, with the occasional war-clad
Molyneuxan or enslaved human figure.  Drug-pacified servants finish
unloading the ship's cargo all around you, but the strange green
tinge to the sky...

Syntax: cast miracle <target>
Spell Number: 408

As the Cleric's power becomes complete, they are granted the most powerful
beneficial blessing that they may receive, the ability to ward off the chill
touch of death itself. Should a character who has recently felt the sting of
the Reaper come to the Cleric, there is a small chance that, through the
power of prayer, the experience that had been lost to the character may be
recovered in full. Through the invocation of this spell, the Gods may see fit
to grant the targeted character the return of any experience that they may 
have lost.

Due to the fickle nature of the Gods, however, even this power does have its
limits. Should the character gain significant xp (from killing a monster or
too many skill/spell increases), level, quit, or die again (including in
warfare and combat), the spell will not be successful.  In addition, the
spell may only be attempted once per character per death.  Regardless of the
outcome, any further attempts to restore lost experience in any form will not
be possible.  If your character is set to not gain experience via the noexp
toggle, no experience will be restored even if the miracle is successful.

Though paladins also receive this ability, their communication with the Gods
is not as pure, and as such, they have a slightly lower chance of success
compared to clerics.  Characters that have grown even closer to the Gods tend
to have better luck with miracles (see 'help tier').

Primary stat: Luck.

  From this pier, ships carry cargoes of grain and goods to ports all across 
the known world, and return bearing raw materials or special local crafts to 
the world's central, more urban regions. To the east, you can see a large 
ship preparing to depart, while to the south lies the Chequered Owl, a 
popular tavern frequented by sailors and locals alike. From the commotion 
visible through the tavern's open door, it looks like a busy night.

The End of the Pier
  Here, the cargo ship Eleanor Gast prepares to set sail to the island city of 
Rhodus, its hold loaded down with grain. No dockhands are in sight, so the 
ship will probably be leaving port shortly. However, the captain isn't in 
sight either, which is very abnormal. No other ships are docked at this end 
of the pier, so the captain must have gone elsewhere.

You step into the Eleanor Gast and arrive in...
Before the Gates of Rhodus
  The Eleanor Gast sits at a pier here before the southern gate of
Rhodus, the only city on the Isle of Molyneux.  The gate, a white marble
archway with no discernable door or portcullis, is an architectural marvel;
fifty feet tall, every inch of the archway covered with sculpture.  Images
of wyverns and gods of the sea dominate, with the occasional war-clad
Molyneuxan or enslaved human figure.  Drug-pacified servants finish
unloading the ship's cargo all around you, but the strange green
tinge to the sky...

The captain stands here, overseeing the last of the unloading.

  This square honors Emperor Orduna LX, the 98th Emperor of Molyneux and 
current resident of the Emerald Throne. His statue, tall and melancholy, 
dominates the square. Beneath your feet, the stones of Reimers Avenue leading
north and south mix with the blue-tinged marble of Loredo Avenue, turning the
stones of the square itself into a dazzlingly beautiful spectacle. A

Loredo Avenue
  The veined marble of Loredo Avenue continues east and west, almost as broad 
as Reimers Avenue, but not quite. The north side of the avenue is blocked by 
the frescoed wall separating the Inner City, accessible only to native 
Molyneuxans, from the Merchants' Quarter where foreigners are permitted to 
visit. The day's unseasonable chill reminds you of the Nixie slowly 
approaching from the west, threatening to destroy Rhodus in all its beauty

interrupts your dark reverie, focusing your attention on the brightly-painted
house of a craftsman, its door open in an invitation for visitors to enter

Orduna Plaza
  This square honors Emperor Orduna LX, the 98th Emperor of Molyneux and 
current resident of the Emerald Throne. His statue, tall and melancholy, 
dominates the square. Beneath your feet, the stones of Reimers Avenue leading
north and south mix with the blue-tinged marble of Loredo Avenue, turning the
stones of the square itself into a dazzlingly beautiful spectacle. A 
filigreed silver gate to the north blocks travel beyond the Merchants' 
Quarter to visitors such as yourself.

Loredo Avenue
  Loredo Avenue leads east and west here, named for Loredo XXIX, the "Grey 
Emperor", who according to the history books had fallen in love with a 
succubus, and soon after succumbed, having had his life force taken from him 
by the fiend. To honor his name and legend, marble with veins of grey paves 
the avenue. To the north, the walls of the Inner City border the road, 
preventing foreigners from travelling deeper into Rhodus; a silver filigreed 
gate closes off the avenue to the east for the same purpose. To your south, 
you see a large building of smooth granite carved in the image of a gigantic 
wyvern, two stories tall.

ship will probably be leaving port shortly. However, the captain isn't in 
sight either, which is very abnormal. No other ships are docked at this end 
of the pier, so the captain must have gone elsewhere.

You step into the Eleanor Gast and arrive in...
Before the Gates of Rhodus
  The Eleanor Gast sits at a pier here before the southern gate of
Rhodus, the only city on the Isle of Molyneux.  The gate, a white marble
archway with no discernable door or portcullis, is an architectural marvel;
fifty feet tall, every inch of the archway covered with sculpture.  Images
of wyverns and gods of the sea dominate, with the occasional war-clad
Molyneuxan or enslaved human figure.  Drug-pacified servants finish
unloading the ship's cargo all around you, but the strange green
tinge to the sky...

Orduna Plaza
  This square honors Emperor Orduna LX, the 98th Emperor of Molyneux and 
current resident of the Emerald Throne. His statue, tall and melancholy, 
dominates the square. Beneath your feet, the stones of Reimers Avenue leading
north and south mix with the blue-tinged marble of Loredo Avenue, turning the
stones of the square itself into a dazzlingly beautiful spectacle. A 
filigreed silver gate to the north blocks travel beyond the Merchants' 
Quarter to visitors such as yourself.

Reimers Avenue
  The pearly stone of Reimers Avenue continues to the south, while a large open
square occupies a crossroads to your north. As you walk amongst the crowd of 
slow-moving slaves and hurried Molyneuxans, you pull your cloak tighter 
around yourself as an unnaturally chilly wind blows through. Looking up past 
the spires of beautiful Rhodus, at the expanse of green where there should be
a warm, sunny spring sky, the twisted state of the natural world around 
Molyneux makes you feel sick to your stomach. Glancing around for a place to
get out from under this disturbing sky, you see a house made of rare, 
expensive wood to your west, and an empty storefront to the east.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

Dirt Road
  The trees thin a little and the dirt path angles roughly northward. The path 
has been quite worn down with use. Though you can see the usual bootprints of
human soldiers that like to traverse this area, there is also a marking that 
is not one of theirs. Though it is not paved, this road is well tended in its
usage, except for a section on the east side.

Ancient Sagewood (1904)

Ancient Sagewood
  The noticable grey-colored bark on these massive trees gives an impression of
antiquity. The sheer size of the trees all around you indicate that they have
been standing for a very long time. The large trunks, branches, and overgrown
roots give the woodland creatures a place to call home.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

Crudely Carved Passage (G)
  It is pitch black, and you wait a moment for your eyes to adjust so you
can get your bearings.  You soon realize that you are in the middle of some
sort of Sahuagin stronghold.  The passage you stand in leads off in various
directions.  The faint shrieks pain and death coming from beyond the stone
walls send tremors of apprehension through your body.

gold and the bowls of fine china that sit on the primitive table in the

rooms you have come across in this stronghold.  The tenant of this lair is
undeniably one who is unusually fascinated by the items that have been

Grand Antechamber of the Sahuagin Palace
  The gloomy, stone walls rise above into a high, expansive dome that
vanishes into an inky darkness.  The lichen clinging to the stone gives off
a faint, sickly glow.  Monumental statues, carved from black, volcanic rock
are displayed on either side of you.  Each portrays a distorted, grotesque
Sahuagin and sharks performing horrific acts of torture to sea elves,
tritons and mermen.  The pure sense of evil that emanates from this chamber
causes you to sweat even in these underwater conditions.  To your north are
heavily-guarded, colossal coral-inlaid doors.  Guessing by the size of the
Sahuagin standing guard on either side, you get the feeling that something
of great importance is on the other side of those doors.  The deep black
eyes of the very large guard standing directly in front of the door fall on
you, leaving you with a twisting, nauseous feeling in your gut.

enchanting leaves.  You reach your hand up to your head and wipe beads of
sweat off your brow - it's sweltering in here, but you can't imagine being
anywhere else, for the place is just so beautiful.  In the distance you hear
water running.  Looking to your north you see a tiny river, and to the far

A Foggy Rainforest
  As you travel farther into the rainforest, a sense of serenity overcomes
you.  The canopy overhead creates a dark green shield, effectively
dispersing the sun's rays.  Yet lack of light does not mean lack of warmth:
the trees before you seem to shimmer as waves of heat roll gently up towards
the sky.  Not too far removed from the forest, wispy tendrils of black smoke
seem to reach out over the treetops and grasp what little of the sky is
visible.

faint odor of smoke and roast is detected in the distance; you are obviously

it is as if the rainforest was never there.  You blink your eyes rapidly as
if trying to awaken from a dream.  The once lush forest is now replaced by a
fertile valley.  You notice, oddly enough, crops such as wheat and corn are
growing - something strange is going on here.  You suppose that you'd best
travel onward.

Gate at the Edge of the Amazon Nation (G)
  As you approach the gate, you instantly realize that this kingdom is not
the Amazon tribes of legend.  No, there are no scantily-clad women here!  At
the smooth limestone gate rests a wagon full of corn for trade: a sure sign
that the nation's economy is as strong as its warriors.  A cobblestone road
leads inside the village's stable walls to the north, while to the east a
small, dirty path meanders across the luscious plain.

A Dirty Path
  Beautiful Juniper trees line the edge of this dusty country lane.  The
aromas of various rare spices tint the air with an aura of freshness.  An
amazon trader passes you by with her two aging black pack horses and gives
you a smile.  She is a good example of a true amazon: kind and friendly, yet
she has a fierce passion for her work.  The dirt path snakes southwards here
- you have yet to discover where it leads.

Inside the Village Wall
  After passing the slender stone wall, you are greeted by the sounds of
more "traditional" amazons.  From the rainforest and the outer gates, you
realize that things aren't always what they seem.  The leaves of the nearby
trees seem to be reaching towards a large stone structure far to the north. 
You can barely make out the outlines of this grand edifice.  The cobblestone
path gives you a feeling of a fresh countryside, and the sun's rays spiral
happily down towards the earth.  A faint scent of pine seems to wrap around
the village, and in the distance this pleasant feeling is countered by the
sounds of Amazon warriors training in the distance.

Heading Towards the Amazon Village
  You are standing on the outskirts of the amazon village.  Even though you
have passed by the stone wall on the outer fringes, the village itself still
does not commence for a while.  Far in the distance, you can barely make out
the shape of a large edifice - it appears to be a mansion of some sort.  The
sky is clear and you can hear the cockatoos chirping merrily in the nearby
rainforest.  A soft breeze gently sways the branches of nearby trees and
helps to quell the heat.  You can still smell the spices of the amazon
traders beyond the city wall.  To your east and west lie amazon guardhouses.

Inside a Guardhouse
  The guardhouse here is the final line of defense for the amazons; hence,
it is one of the only amazon buildings made of stone.  From outside the
window you see several amazon houses to the northwest.  A sparkling blue
river serves as a natural barrier as well: the water snakes around the
village outskirts.  The guards seem to be slacking off, but with good
reason: the amazon nation has lived in peace ever since the centaur wars
many years earlier.  Still, you are comforted by the fact that Queen Melosa
has these guards in case something were to happen.

  The rainforest trees continue on inside the village as if they had never

order to make things easier for the guards ...  Who knows?  Only minimal

Heading Towards the Amazon Huts
  Starting along the worn dirt path, you realize that the amazon village is
very intriguing.  The place is so well concealed by the canopy of rainforest
trees that you aren't surprised that the nation wasn't discovered by the
"civilized" world earlier.  Except for the dirt path and the town's center
to the west, the vegetation is so dense that very little can be seen.  Even
the slightest breeze causes the trees to sing a symphony of rustling leaves.

you that the amazons are not only at one with nature, but also very tolerant

The shrine to Valaska
  As you enter this hut, you notice that it seems much bigger on the inside
than it does on the outside.  Several tree stumps planted in the earthen
ground serve as places of worship for Valaska's followers.  On the opposite
side of the 'temple' is painted a green crescent moon with a fuschia star:
Valaska's holy symbol.  In the center of the hut is a dark brown table which
serves as the altar.  Various books and artifacts lie on the table -
Valaska's holy book, a garnet staff, and a half-full, corked vial.  Although

great that to the north nothing can be seen behind it; not even the towering
rainforest trees that encircle the village.  Little by little, you notice
the setting getting fancier and more "modernized".  The hut to the east,
for example, is larger and more decorated than many others.  In that
direction, the sound of weapons being sharpened stings your ears.  A strange
force nags at your face as you look towards the west; at first you merely
dismiss it as static in the air, but slowly you realize that the forces of
magic are at work.  A feeling of delight overwhelms you as you realize the

The magic hut
  At first glance, this hut seems remarkably similar to the others: Thatch
roof, strange-smelling mud walls, and a modest size, but still livable. 
What makes this place different, however, is the occupant.  Unlike many of
the other amazons, this woman is not in her prime by any means.  This mystic
sells various magical items for visitors: she also gets occasional business
from Joanna the cleric and Jules the shaman.  Shelves filled with freshly
crushed herbs encircle the hut's inner walls: Shanda prefers to make her
potions using natural plants found in the rainforest.  This place smells
strangely like a medicine cabinet, but you know that the magical forces
within are ten times as dangerous.

loudly in your ears as you hear the weaponsmith hard at work.  The hut
itself is imperfect, as lumps of hardened brown clay protrude from the thick
walls, but you can tell that the edifice is adequate for Milyla's work. 
What strikes you most is the quality of the weapons forged: the various
swords, axes, and bows seem to glow with a soft inner light.  You gently
pass your hand over a newly forged broadsword and can feel the power
eminating from the object.  It is clear that Milyla takes pride in the work

spectacular women you met here.  The noises of the village start to
disappear as you get closer to the mansion of Queen Melosa.  You now realize
that nothing seems to be around here: this area serves as 'dead space' to
separate the castle from the main part of the village.  It's not that Melosa
wants to remove herself from the people because she dislikes them, she just
prefers for her home to be more detached from the village in order to
preserve some of the mystery around it.  You grow more and more excited as
you near the castle, for you now see that it is indeed a splendid dwelling.

  After passing through the fence that separates the main castle from the

people: They produce their own food, weapons, and magic, and thus don't need
to import anything.  It is only very recently that the amazons have decided
to send out their surplus goods to other nations: and it has worked out for
the better.  So much food is produced in this garden that the amazons can't
possibly eat all of it.  The scents of spices, vegetables, and flowers fill

The Lettuce Garden
  Common to most other gardens of the world, the amazon garden has a whole
section full of leafy green lettuce heads.  Some water has condensed upon
the lettuce, causing the vegetables to glimer in the sunlight.  The plants
are crisp and fresh, and just looking at them makes your mouth water for
some fresh salad.  It's too bad that a lot of this lettuce will just be fed
to the yaks, because it certainly looks scrumptious.  Again, you cant help
but marvel at the fact that the garden just seems so perfect in every way. 
It's clear to you that the amazons are a hard-working people.  You feel
relieved that the food looks delicious: the pot pies that are sold in Aylor
are adequate, but pale when compared to the splendor of the food in this
garden.

starting to get to you: hopefully it would rain soon.  Who knows?  Maybe the
spices will grow better if it were to rain.  The gardeners who wander around
here seem to pay you little heed, as they are far too busy tending to the
plants to converse.  You can't wait to find out what the food tastes like,
but if the spices are any indication the meals will be divine.

  Bushes, spices, fruits, and vegetables abound in the castle's garden. 
Here, part of the rainforest has been chopped away in order that plants
could grow uninhibited.  A sunbeam encircles the garden, its light
rejuvinating the plants and providing adequate warmth for the gardeners.  In
the distance, one hears the song of the red-and-white cockatoos and the
music of the toucan.  You kneel on the ground and gently pluck a ripened
tomato from its ivy green vine and pop it into your mouth.  Mmmmmmm ...  The
workers certainly put a lot of time and effort into making the best food in
the area!  The huge garden continues on for some distance, which is a good
thing considering that all the food looks delicious and the vegetation
marvelously attractive.

  In this sector are the non-edible plants of the garden: baby trees,
shrubs, and flowers grace the land here.  It is said that the amazons use
the extracts of some of the flowers to make beautifully scented perfumes. 
The tree sap is also used as flavoring in some of the cook's rare dishes. 
Even though each plant's odor is pleasant by itself, together the smells
create a swirl of nauseous fumes.  You begin to feel dizzy as the

Entrance to the Royal Garden
  After passing through the fence that separates the main castle from the
garden, you begin to realize that the amazons are very self-supporting
people: They produce their own food, weapons, and magic, and thus don't need
to import anything.  It is only very recently that the amazons have decided
to send out their surplus goods to other nations: and it has worked out for
the better.  So much food is produced in this garden that the amazons can't
possibly eat all of it.  The scents of spices, vegetables, and flowers fill
the air, creating an aura of pleasantness around the garden.  The main part
of the castle is to the east, while the garden continues north, south, and
west.

  You have exited the castle and now find yourself on a beautiful porch
just outside the castle garden.  An intriguing lattice framework shields
part of the porch from the sizzling heat of the sun, providing a bit of
shelter for the workers.  You sense that the garden is a place not only for
growing vegetables, but also a place for the castle's dwellers and visitors
to get some rest and relaxation.  Several tables and chairs are set up here
for the guests' comfort, and, much to your delight, a small wicker basket
holding a newly prepared salad rests in front of each chair.  You take a
bite ...  The salad tastes just as good as it looks!  The gardeners
definitely do a superb job of growing food!

pasture.  These animals are found only in the amazon nation, and many
consider them to be an 'exotic' mammal.  Contrary to what many people might
tell you, the main purpose of the yaks is not to feed the amazons: in fact,
very few yaks are actually used as meat.  These shaggy bovines serve mainly
as pets for the amazons.  True, they eat a lot, but they don't require much
grooming and are very friendly creatures.  The white marble corridor
continues to the east, and a large intersection is to the west.

yaks don't appear to mind one way or the other: they are simply content with
chewing grass and drinking water.  The long, hairy creatures are quite tame,
for when you go up to one and start petting it, the being does not jump or

Hallway Leading to the Yak Pasture
  This hallway leads to on of the most sacred places in the castle: the yak
pasture.  These animals are found only in the amazon nation, and many
consider them to be an 'exotic' mammal.  Contrary to what many people might
tell you, the main purpose of the yaks is not to feed the amazons: in fact,
very few yaks are actually used as meat.  These shaggy bovines serve mainly
as pets for the amazons.  True, they eat a lot, but they don't require much
grooming and are very friendly creatures.  The white marble corridor
continues to the east, and a large intersection is to the west.

Intersection of Two Hallways
  You have arrived at the first major intersection in Melosa's Castle. 
Several potted plants line each corner of the chamber, providing a sense of
one-ness with nature.  You gaze in wonder at the size of the castle - the
ceiling seems almost endless!  After your journey through the sticky, stuffy
rainforest and the humid village, you are pleased to discover that a cool
breeze blows lightly through the castle.  To the northeast you smell some
food being cooked, while to the northwest you hear some rather loud
discussions going on.  Some way ahead you see a beautiful golden door.

The Meeting Chamber
  In this complex, Queen Melosa and her assistants hold meetings to discuss
laws and regulate trade.  Of course, the Queen has the final word in all
decisions, so her aides can only try to sway her opinions one way or the
other.  Lining the black marble walls are eight pedestals, and on top of
each is a clay effigy of a former Amazon Queen.  Currently, the Amazons are
discussing trade policies with diplomats from the world's five major cities:
Aylor, Northstar, Arisia, Kerofk, and Reme.  The various countries are
trying to put together a trade deal which will benefit them all.  The
volumes of the conversations are at a dull roar as each side attempts to
make its requests known to the others.

  A huge juniper table sits in the middle of the black marble room.  Some

heats up to such a point that an amazon warrior gets up in disgust and
storms out of the room muttering in her language.  A diamond chandelier
hangs from the ceiling, illuminating the conversations with its effervescent
light.  The air seems somewhat tense, as the politics going on could well

of the room contains some refreshments for the representatives and
diplomats.  Politics is tough work, after all!  The room has a bookshelf on

perhaps in one of these books you can find out about part of the history of
the amazons.  The meeting chamber continues east and south.

accepts the recommendation of her aides.  The room is very hot and stuffy,

village and its outskirts: One of a red and white cockatoo seems to stand
out as being exceptionally colorful and life-like.  The smell of freshly
baked wheat rolls and onion soup filter to your nose from the nearby
kitchen.  Unlike the great halls of many modern castles, Queen Melosa's
great hall consists of dozens of small tables as opposed to one large one. 
This layout provides more elbow room for the guests, but it also can make
walking around somewhat of a hazard.

The main course has not been served as of yet; the diners are satisfying
their appetites on onion soup and (*gasp*) yak meat soup.  Some of the

virtually spotless, as Queen Melosa's servants do a commendable job of

amazons have remarkably good table manners, unlike the stereotypes that the
asinine city dwellers perpetrate.  You pull up a varnished wood chair and

    Closer and closer it gets.  As you approach the castle, you make a mental
note to return to the village soon and talk again with some of the
spectacular women you met here.  The noises of the village start to
disappear as you get closer to the mansion of Queen Melosa.  You now realize
that nothing seems to be around here: this area serves as 'dead space' to
separate the castle from the main part of the village.  It's not that Melosa
wants to remove herself from the people because she dislikes them, she just
prefers for her home to be more detached from the village in order to
preserve some of the mystery around it.  You grow more and more excited as
you near the castle, for you now see that it is indeed a splendid dwelling.

Path to the Castle
  More and more of the castle is visible to the north: its expanse is so
great that to the north nothing can be seen behind it; not even the towering
rainforest trees that encircle the village.  Little by little, you notice
the setting getting fancier and more "modernized".  The hut to the east,
for example, is larger and more decorated than many others.  In that
direction, the sound of weapons being sharpened stings your ears.  A strange
force nags at your face as you look towards the west; at first you merely
dismiss it as static in the air, but slowly you realize that the forces of
magic are at work.  A feeling of delight overwhelms you as you realize the
castle isn't that far ahead.

Outside Queen Melosa's Castle
  You are finally standing at the castle of Queen Melosa!  The castle is a
huge edifice of white marble: the castle appears to be as pure as freshly
fallen snow, but it has the warm feeling of a weekend picnic at grandma's
house.  The bronze gate to the north is guarded by two powerful looking
females: Perhaps it would be best to continue forward and give them no
trouble.  Towards the back of the castle two towers reach their probing

Hallway Leading to the Yak Pasture
  The hallway ends abruptly here, and a large wooden fence to the east
separates the castle from the pasture.  As strange as it may seem, the
pasture appears to be cooler than the inside of the castle!  Perhaps, you
think, it is to keep the poor animals from suffering due to the high
temperature and humidity of the area.  You chuckle as you see a small amazon
child babbling away about her recent "adventures" in the rainforest. 
Everything is very peaceful in the castle, as the amazons are content to let
you go on your way.

Entrance to the Royal Yak Pasture (1900)

A Tiny Lake
  In this corner of the lake pasture, a small pond, not more than 10 or 15
feet in radius and only about a couple feet deep, is surrounded by several
yaks who want to quench their thirst.  This miniature lake is located in a
small basin: the pond looks almost as if someone had dug it out.  Yet the
yaks don't appear to mind one way or the other: they are simply content with
chewing grass and drinking water.  The long, hairy creatures are quite tame,
for when you go up to one and start petting it, the being does not jump or
whine in fright.  You find the creature quite pleasant, and fortunately the
amazons are breeding them mostly for companionship and only partly for food.
Thank goodness no one wants to make a fly swatter out of the poor yaks'
tails!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

crimson banners hanging from the wall, possibly those of the resident's
house, and can see at a glance that the occupant is a wizard. There are
numerous shelves taking up wall space, cluttered with items whose descriptions
range from artifact to junk. A skull even lies on the edge of one shelf,
undecipherable words etched onto the teeth remaining. In the center of the
room, however, there is a clean and entirely uncluttered table made of redwood
and surrounded by matching cushioned chairs. The table has painted upon it a

On occasion, the immaterial may come under threat, or destabilize,
requiring outside intervention in order to keep Andolor's metaphysics
in check.  It is rumored that when a shambling horror, carrying a
large glowing egg in its belly is spotted: that it is an omen of
terrible times to come.  It is thus also known that when such an
event occurs, it is a call to battle for all those in the realm.
Small or large, strong or not, all efforts matter.

Fractals of the Weave is accessed every few days via an automatic
respawn of an mob 3 south of Aylor recall, and immortals can spawn
the event on special occasions.  3 South, 1 down of Aylor recall
is a special room where the 'sense life' spell can be cast to
determine when the event will spawn again.

The event is open to all players, from level 1 through to 201.
Anyone can participate, and no matter your level, you need not
fear gruesome death if you pay a little bit of attention.

An Elegant Chamber
  This chamber is decorated in a predominately dark crimson motif. You see
crimson banners hanging from the wall, possibly those of the resident's
house, and can see at a glance that the occupant is a wizard. There are
numerous shelves taking up wall space, cluttered with items whose descriptions
range from artifact to junk. A skull even lies on the edge of one shelf,
undecipherable words etched onto the teeth remaining. In the center of the
room, however, there is a clean and entirely uncluttered table made of redwood
and surrounded by matching cushioned chairs. The table has painted upon it a
silver snake against a dark crimson background.

platform, upon which has been painted the various arcane symbols needed to

  A highway you never noticed before leads off to the east,
away from the eerie lights and sounds of the staging grounds
and to salvation, or so you hope.  Rapidly approaching is what
appears to be a troop of soldiers marching alongside a wagon.
Now you can get away from the staging grounds and the fate it

a hideous, giant bat out of the infernal regions.  You think you've

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

An Elegant Chamber
  This chamber is decorated in a predominately dark crimson motif. You see
crimson banners hanging from the wall, possibly those of the resident's
house, and can see at a glance that the occupant is a wizard. There are
numerous shelves taking up wall space, cluttered with items whose descriptions
range from artifact to junk. A skull even lies on the edge of one shelf,
undecipherable words etched onto the teeth remaining. In the center of the
room, however, there is a clean and entirely uncluttered table made of redwood
and surrounded by matching cushioned chairs. The table has painted upon it a
silver snake against a dark crimson background.

On a Highway East of the Staging Grounds

away from the eerie lights and sounds of the staging grounds

Now you can get away from the staging grounds and the fate it

a hideous, giant bat out of the infernal regions.  You think you've
seen something like that before, but can't quite remember exactly

The Ritual Staging Grounds (G)
  You are standing on a wide open field of grass, where it has been decided
the ritual to open the Great Portal will be carried out.  There is a raised
platform, upon which has been painted the various arcane symbols needed to
help open the Great Portal between worlds.  The very air around the platform
seems to be glowing with darkness, seeming to eminate from the symbols.  
Something is not quite right here...

Infirmary (G)
  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

Military Surplus Store (G)
  You have entered a warehouse filled with military gear. Heaps of battered 
helmets and other miscellanea lay scattered randomly around the warehouse.
Dust covers much of it, tickling your nostrils, and making you want to 
sneeze. As you make your way down the ragtag aisles you finally stumble upon
the front desk. An old man with one eye stares at you. Better make it quick 
he doesn't seem to have much patience. Type list to view its wares.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered

Grouping can be a fun way to meet people and can be a way to 
alleviate the boredom of grinding.

There is a channel wangrp to help you find a group.  It's
the best place to ask.  Don't beg and don't be annoying and
you might find some new friends.

Note: To turn off and on a channel just type the name of
      of the channel.

| Today some(hopefully all) have noticed that I am now
| a leader of Boot. My first act will be to slowly change
| the clan from a military theme to a more passive them based
| on our new deity The Grand Cobbler. As we will focus on Boots
| we also will recognize other shoes as well.
| 
| All kidding asside, I spent alot of time thinking about
| if I wanted to do this role. I don't take my promotion
| lightly and as much as I try to mix fun and sarcasm into
| everything, I will try to keep things that are official slightly
| more serious toned. That said I want to continue to be one of
| the more approachable veteren players in Boot. So please don't
| feel like I've gained some new scary tag or something. I'm still
| the same hardly serious joker. I just going to help recruit people
| at 11pm mudtime when everyone else is asleep :P
| 
| So if you need anything or just want to tell me how slow Epsilon
| levels, feel free to keep sending me tells, or whatever. I accept
| carrier pigeon as well. I actually joined this clan not knowing
| how long I would be here and in the process of getting my feet back

From    : Ospario: Bard's Equinox Event (Sept. 22-24)

| An Eminently Exciting Equinox Event of Boundless Bardic Banter
| 
| Goodness, graces, and gracious greetings.
| 
| I bring word far and wide of a spectacle of such awe inspiring displays of
| wit and verbal fervor, that it would be a mortal sin to not inform my
| former brethren of the occasion. 
| 
| Some may remember me. I am Boot alumnus, Ospario. I recently haunted your
| clan hall as a devoted follower of the Unknown Soldier, incessantly
| pitching one multi-level marketing scheme after another in the throes 
| of a wormwood and nausea medication inspired fever dream.
| My welcome wore thinner with each until the door found me.
| 
| As I left, I was ready to spill gold, urine and dilute acetic acid into
| the hearts and homes of the world at large but found another path - within
| the halls of those gentle warriors of the mind, the Bards.
| 
| Times such as this, I could regale you with stories of entrails that spill
| into a relief of Whistlers mother, or the mewling of a dragonling as it
| suckles upon a Morningstar in motion, but I tell of greater enterprises.
| 
| The Bard clan will be hosting an event on the weekend of the autumnal
| equinox, September 22-24th, and we cordially invite all Boot members
| to attend the events to beheld in clan hall and on gametalk, as well as be
| aware of the billion gold worth of crumbles that will be dispersed the
| entire weekend from the 22nd to the 24th. We will also be present to
| discuss the future that Bard clan may hold in store for any Boot members
| looking to leave the nest.
| On Saturday the 23rd, we will be hosting a flyting competition with open
| registration for any interested parties. The easiest way to register will
| be through tells or notes to me, Ospario. Flyting is a deceptively simple
| and sincerely devious game of call and response in couplets. Each round
| will have two participants face off against each other, with two turns per
| player to come up with a line of poetry, usually similar to something
| another world may call battle rapping, and two turns per player to respond
| with a line to their opponent line, matching rhyme and theme. Prizes for
| top three contestants to be announced as the event draws nearer.
| On Sunday the 24th, the garrulous genius of our in-house navigator of
| culture, Grrdy, will be yours to go head-to-head with in a stirring game
| of trivia. Know the unexpected, and expect nothing, as to be champion of
| this trivia is to be champion of the universes mysteries, with TP tokens
| for top three contestants and gold for every correct first answer.
| 
| As for the clan, members will be available all weekend and are excited to
| talk to any of you about the exciting opportunities our fall recruitment
| drive can afford you.
| We are a fun loving group of creative minded players that found the Muse
| of Aardwolf keening in a dark cave, splotched and gasping. In its final
| throes, this Bardic prophecy suddenly flashed opalescent star shine from
| somewhere deep within their crotch area. We hacked, slashed and stomped
| that husk of creativity until ribbons of flesh fell away to reveal the
| glittering jewel that is the new Bard Clan. 
| For a limited time, we are offering new members the ability to retain up
| to two promotions in their clan when they join with the brainy brutes of a
| Bardic bent. 
| 
| I know the comforts of Boot, and I know the cold realities of having no
| home to go to, letting your head fall on the nearest corpse at the end of
| a long day. We promise nothing less than total enlightenment and a state of
| living Nirvana, but our meal plans are pretty good too.
| 
| I hope to see all of you on the Equinox!
| 
| 
| -Ospario

Your anti-magic shell disappears.

You no longer absorb magical attacks.

The wind blows mightily as a rift opens nearby.

Syntax:  forum           : Lists unread notes on subscribed boards.
         forum <name/#>  : Switches to board with given name/number.
         forum all       : Lists note counts on all subscribed boards.

The 'forum' command lists and navigates through Aardwolf's note/forum
system.  It is used in combination with the 'note' command (see 'help
note') to read notes sorted by content.  You may choose to filter this
content with the 'subscribe' command- see 'help subscribe'.

By itself, 'forum' will list any subscribed boards with unread notes, along
with the board number, name, and description of the board's contents.  You
can switch to any board by typing 'forum <number>' or 'forum <name in
full>', such as 'forum 1' or 'forum announce'.  Typing 'note' when there
are no new notes on a forum will automatically switch you to the next
subscribed forum with unread notes.

Of particular interest are the Announce, Mudinfo, and Personal forums.  The
Announce forum contains pertinent game information such as rules and policy
changes and updates.  The Mudinfo forum contains other game information,
such as contests, MUD-wide polls, and other minor changes.  The Personal
forum is used for things such as messages to Imms, other players, and
clans.

If you want to know what's happening in the realm of Aardwolf, reading 
the forums is a VERY good idea, and should be done as a matter of habit.

The 'board' command is a global alias for 'forum'.

See 'help note' for information on interacting with individual
notes on a forum.

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:

3. Prairie Village Estates [Manorville]
4. Seaside Height Estates  [Manorsea]

Note: - Please take a look at the rooms closely and read any signs
        posted. Rooms nearest the entrance to the area will need a 
        manor deed in order to be purchased.

      - Previous manor areas are off limits to new construction.
        These manors include: Manor1, Manorisle, and Manor3.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  This once great city-state has been reduced to a mere pile of rubble. The
ground is scorched with the marks of an epic battle that was fought here. A
tattered banner with a Feline crest dances playfully in the wind. A few 
arrows are still lodged into the side of a wooden wagon tipped over on its
side. Nearly all of the stone buildings seem have been entirely collapsed
into jagged piles of stone debris.

Woodlands Drive
  A red fox bounds across the road before you, scampering after a mole or mouse
too small to make out with any certainty. The fox disappears from sight, red 
tail flashing briefly between the leaf laden saplings growing by the road.
The quaint road continues along a fairly straight north and south direction.

  Mist rises from the shaded road, swirling mysteriously as you pass. Heavy 
drops of moisture fall randomly from the tree branches overhead. The air is 
quiet, sounds muffled by the thickness of the forest. The dampness begins to 
seep into your boots, and the thought of it raises goose bumps on your arms.
The warmth of your cloak relieves you of the fleeting chill.

  A grand old oak tree grows immediately to the south, blocking further 
progress in that direction. As a result, the road turns eastwards, deferring 
to the grandeur of the ancient moss-covered tree. A very small rabbit stops 
in its tracks, frightened by your passage. It pretends to not to see you, 
sitting still, looking in the other direction. It's easy to imagine its 
thoughts 'I am stone, I am stone.'

The Men of Letters Secret Bunker
  
Following the river down a dead-end road you come across what appears to
be a power plant sitting atop a hill. It looks to be in a state of
neglect as if it has not been in use for many years. 

Searching around the rivers bank you discover a solid, metal
door framed in concrete. Above the door, careved into it's concrete frame
is a strange symbol. Known as a Unicursal Hexagram, you recall seeing
this symbol among your many adventures and heard it called by another
name, The Aquarian Star. It is said to have stood at the gates of
Atlantis

Staring at the door it dawns upon you. This must be the fabled Men Of
Letters secret bunker! Tales of this place have echoed throughout time
among intellects of magic and mysticism. Warded against any evil ever
created, this is where The Men of Letters are said to have stored every
object, scroll, and spell ever collected for thousands of years under one
roof. It is the supernatural mother lode. If knowledge is power, then
this is the most powerful place on Earth.

A chill runs the length of your spine as you realise anything you could
ever need, against any foe, lies right beyond the door infont of you.
Alas, try as you may the door refuses to budge. As you turn to walk away,
you take one last look over your shoulder, as you walk away from the
largest collection of magic in existance.

Woodberry Hill Circle
  Woodberry Hill Circle runs the perimeter of Woodberry Hill, which rises, not 
too high, to the west, and falls, not too low, to the east. Hidden among the 
trees are residences, the like of which you have never before seen. They are 
barely discernible from that which belongs in nature - tree, sapling, bush

Dairu's front porch
  Stepping through a wooden, chest-high gate, you find yourself on a porch�of
a medium-sized house.
In here the air is pleasantly warm.
Every so often, a tepid breeze caresses your face, carrying a scent of�roasted
meat.
All around you, the smell of a comforting campfire permeates the�surroundings.
For some reason, the weather in here, always seems to be consistent, no�matter
the conditions outside.
The porch itself consists entirely of wood. Just now you notice the�intricate
carvings, the planks building the floor, as well as the wooden�posts supporting
roof are depicted with different sceens from far away�lands.
You see pictures of eagles, hawks, and dragons, carved meticulously into�the
wood.
The picture of a huge griffon is carved into the floor. The creature's�tail
pointing towards the entrance of the house, while it's head peers�directly at
the gate, as if it is there, to guard the place.
It is probably not a coincidence you assume, that the beast's mouth is�open,
showing several rows of ferocious-looking, needle sharp teeth.

ranging from purple-black roses, blue roses, lilacs, tulips, white roses 
and many more, you follow a small path leading to a dark yet beautiful large 
grey castle surrounded by a deep dark green forest, further along the path to
the castle a large yet beautiful dark black raven flies over head, the sky 
begins to turn black and you feel as if you are lost. Quickly you run to the
castle only to find a large black panther guarding the door. The castle 
itself is 50 feet high and lightning cracks overhead. Behind the pather, a

A Small, Rundown House
  A short stone wall lines the perimeter of a simple house. Two pillars 
rise about a foot above the rest of the wall to mark the entryway.  
There is a walkway of wooden planks that leads to an unassuming  
door, which is beginning to rust. The house is small, its walls almost  
entirely encroached by twisting foliage and vines. 
  The roof is missing a few tiles. The front yard is occupied by a looming  
willow tree. A man leans against the willow trunk, a backpack at his feet.  
Though the front door of the house is locked, a window next to it provides a 
view of the entire inside. It's one large room with no other doors,
empty besides a few pieces of plain furniture.

Dark Mists
  You find yourself standing in confusion and shock as you stumble across a part
of the forest where lush greenery gives way to dark, dead and leafless trees.
You walk cautiously down the broken and uneven path through the dead section of
forest. Glancing at the terrain around you, you notice that the soil is dry and
crumbling and what first appeared as dried roots of trees are in fact shards of
bone sticking out from the lifeless ground. A thick mist rolls past you and for
several minutes, you stumble around blindly before walking into an old wrought
iron gate, which quickly creaks forward even though you are sure that you didn't
push it with enough force to move the rusted metal that far forward. Walking
through the gate, you enter a courtyard with bare lifeless bushes and a cracked
stone tile path leading towards what looks to be a manor built in the style of a
small castle. Walking up the stone stairs of the porch, you notice a black metal
bell hanging from a hook next to the black and red wooden double doors and
staring at those ominous doors, you wonder if you should ring the bell.

Knoll Ridge Bluffs
  This ridge is known to the locals as 'The Bluffs', and the view from every 
point along the Bluffs is quite spectacular. The tree line ends about 50 yards 
east of the road, so it takes a little trek through the woods to find that 
view, but it's well worth it.

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

Last Updated  : 2016-05-07 12:52:28.

Manor Upgrades: Purchasing Information

The Manor Upgrade Generator is now available!  Use this online generator
and all math and the details are done for you.
http://bit.ly/aard_manors

NOTE: For availability, see 'help MU-Locations'

New manors cost 60 trivia points to purchase. Only the new owner and 
his/her spouse may contribute trivia points directly towards this cost.
 
For tier discounts see help mu-tier.
 
First, you must decide where you want your new manor.  Manors are only
available in specific Estate areas.  Within these areas (currently
available areas can be found in help mu-locations), your new porch
and manor exit can be in any direction except south, and cannot be on
another player's porch.  (To see if you're on a porch, go north.  If
you are told the room is private, you are currently on a porch, and
must find another location.)
  
Once you have found the spot you desire, either send a tell to a visible
Imm asking for the vnum of the room you are in, or record the speedwalk
to where you want your room, starting from the entrance room of the area.
 
You can now post a note to imm on the Upgrades board.  In this note, 
please include the vnum or speedwalk, as well as which direction you want
your manor porch from that room.  If you know what you want for your 
rooms' names and descriptions, you can include those in this note as well.
Use of the manor upgrade generator is preferable: http://bit.ly/aard_manors
 
The porch will be set up in the direction you specified, and your private
manor room will be linked to the north of your porch.  A plain fountain,
campfire, and set of descriptions for each room are included at no cost.
(If you are unsure of what you want for descriptions, they can be added 
for free at a later time.)
 
You will be set as owner of your private manor, and will now have access 
to the 'home' and 'invite' commands (see the helpfile on each), plus the
ability to 'rstat' to find your room vnum for upgrades.
 
Congratulations on your new purchase!

There is also a video which shows you how to purchase a manor on Aardwolf:
