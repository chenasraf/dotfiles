The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Xena's Weapon Parlor (G)
  Xena, Andolor's most famous weaponsmith, stands next to a large forge. 
She is speaking with a troll who is testing the feel of a blade in his hand.
Many daggers, swords, flails, and maces sit in racks all neatly organized
for customer access.  A trellis covers this platform, supported by beams
based at each of the four corners.  Various staves and polearms are
suspended from the trellis by large hooks.  A ramp to the north will take
you to a higher platform, while the eastern ramp takes you to a lower one.  

[ Exits: north east south ]
     A small bundle of snacks has been carelessly dropped here.
(White Aura) Xena, the master weaponsmith, stands before you, trying to sell you a blade.
You have 22 tells waiting. Type 'replay' to see them.

Aylorian Elemental Designs
  An old brain teaser asks, "What weighs more, a ton of feathers or a ton
of lead?"  At Aylorian Elemental Designs the answer is, "Which can you
afford to make weigh more?"  These powerful elemental mages have been
disregarding the physics of mass times acceleration for generations!  This
section of the shopette platform is lined with a collection of odd items,
and the elementalists shout for the edification of the crowd: "Come!  See
the feather that weighs as much as a boulder!  See the anvil that is lighter
than a handful of grass clippings!"  The elementalists have prepared a SIGN
for those interested in their services.  

[ Exits: east south ]
(White Aura) A strange old elementalist is standing here.

Xena's Weapon Parlor (G)
  Xena, Andolor's most famous weaponsmith, stands next to a large forge. 
She is speaking with a troll who is testing the feel of a blade in his hand.
Many daggers, swords, flails, and maces sit in racks all neatly organized
for customer access.  A trellis covers this platform, supported by beams
based at each of the four corners.  Various staves and polearms are
suspended from the trellis by large hooks.  A ramp to the north will take
you to a higher platform, while the eastern ramp takes you to a lower one.  

[ Exits: north east south ]
     A small bundle of snacks has been carelessly dropped here.
(White Aura) Xena, the master weaponsmith, stands before you, trying to sell you a blade.

Ivar's Item Remodeling
  The square marble slab floor of this shopette is perfectly clean.  Not a
single thing touches the ground, with the exception of the feet of the
people standing on it.  However, there is still quite a lot here.  Test
tubes and tomes all float in mid-air as though they are resting on invisible
stands and shelves.  One woman sits in mid-air in the middle of the room. 
Her eyes are closed, but you get the feeling that she is completely aware of
her surroundings and of the fact that you are standing before her.  There
are 3 ramps leading north, west, and east to higher-level platforms. 

Perhaps you should read the SIGN.  

[ Exits: north east south west ]
(White Aura) A strange looking psionicist hovers in a sitting position in the middle of the room.

The Aylorian Enchantment Clinic
  Here, in the northeastern corner platform, there are many sacks and boxes
that could possibly hold any number of goods.  The room is generally tidy
but with no rhyme or reason to its layout.  A table holding various powders
and solutions stands in the center of the room.  To the west, a ramp leads
up to the next platform.  To the south, the platform heads down to the
armorer.

  The square marble slab floor of this shopette is perfectly clean.  Not a
single thing touches the ground, with the exception of the feet of the
people standing on it.  However, there is still quite a lot here.  Test
tubes and tomes all float in mid-air as though they are resting on invisible
stands and shelves.  One woman sits in mid-air in the middle of the room. 
Her eyes are closed, but you get the feeling that she is completely aware of
her surroundings and of the fact that you are standing before her.  There
are 3 ramps leading north, west, and east to higher-level platforms. 

Perhaps you should read the SIGN.

Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the

  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western

When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way

libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips

Help Keywords : Remort Multiclass Reborn.
Help Category : Features.
Related Helps : Rebuild, Superhero, Tiers. SH-Stats.
Last Updated  : 2018-07-01 16:22:17.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick Help - How to Remort:

- Go to the remort chamber* to the North-East of Aylor recall.
- Enter 'remort <any class>' to enable remort mode.
- Do any necessary remort auctions.
- When auctions are complete, type 'remort <class>' a second time.

Wishstat and tierstat will need to be re-set upon remorting.


Detailed Help - Aardwolf Remort System:

When you reach SUPERHERO level on Aardwolf, you can continue to gain
trains.  Alternatively, you can choose to be 'reborn' into another class.
What basically happens is that you add another class to your existing set
of skills and spells and restart at level 1.  Because Aardwolf has 7
classes, a player can 'go around' the whole game 7 times.  Since there
is more power to be had, there is also more experience per level to gain as
a tradeoff.

(If playing through 7 classes still isn't enough for you, you can 'tier'
after completing your 7th class, too- see 'help tier' for more information.

There are many features to multiclass playing:

* When you reach the correct level, your existing skills and spells over 
  85% are reset to 85%, or 95% if you have the scholar wish. In the mean 
  time, you gain and practice skills/spells in the new class. 

* Your equipment is retained through each remort (although you must remove
  it from the worn position temporarily during the remort process).

* Your level 201 total stats are saved and restored when you reach level
  201 the next time around. This allows you to try some powerups or
  superhero groups without that time being wasted. See 'help sh-stats' 
  for an explanation of this process.

* Gold, trivia, and quest points are kept. Quest equipment can be 'sold'
  to other players for quest points using remort auctions ('help rauction')
  or long-term market auctions ('help market').

* Online time will remain untouched. 

* Exp required to level increases an extra 1,000 per remort until the
  max for the tier is reached. Full details on exp per level can be
  seen at the bottom of 'help tier'.

* When increasing stats, you will get the primary stat (+5) bonus of all
  your classes.  If you have two classes with the same primary stat, the
  bonus is only given once.  The same applies from level gains- if you have
  mage, thief, and warrior, you will get the highest mana, moves, and hp
  rewards upon level.

* 'Who' and 'Group' will show a 1 letter abbreviation for your class and
  the total number of classes you have. 'whois' and 'finger' will show all
  of your classes.

* Note: Area minimum level locks do not apply to remort characters.

To remort, the following steps are necessary:

1. If you wish to rebuild to a different race, do so before entering remort
   mode.  (Please note that rebuilding is optional and normally only done
   when the player is very unhappy with their current race, primary class,
   or character build.  See 'help rebuild' and 'help classchange'.

2. Go to the Remort Chamber (in the church area just north of recall) and
   type 'remort <classname>'.  At this point the list of commands available
   will be greatly reduced- only commands that you need to continue with
   remort or seek help if necessary will be available.  Type 'commands' to
   see a list of available commands, if necessary.
   
   Once flagged as in remort mode, you may sell quest equipment via remort
   auction (see 'help remort auction') or market (see 'help market').  Note
   that communication is not as easy in remort mode, so get any deals made
   prior to entering remort mode.

3. Type 'remort <class>' a second time to finish the remort process once
   all other items are placed on market or sold on rauction.

Please take a few seconds to very carefully read the messages that the mud
gives you during the remort process.  Unless caused by a bug, any mistakes 
you make during remort will not be reversed by an Imm. 

Keep in mind that when you remort, you are going back to level 1 and your 
item and weight limits will decrease accordingly. It is best to sort out 
any issues relating to this (invis items, etc.) before remorting, rather 
than after, to avoid going over your maximum.

If you have wishstats or tierstats (see 'help tierstat'), you will need to
reassign those again after remort.

* For those who are directionally-challenged: You can runto remort when in
  The Grand City of Aylor, or run 4n2end from recall.

help subclass
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Subclass.
Help Category : Information.
Related Helps : Class, Primary Class.
Last Updated  : 2019-07-19 01:51:34.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax: subclass list              : Lists subclass options for your class.
        subclass all               : Lists all subclass options.
        subclass change <option>   : Changes to a different subclass.

Subclasses are a feature still in development on Aardwolf.  Subclasses are
designed to be an extension of regular classes; they will not limit current
class skills and spells, nor will they be necessary to play the game.
Instead, they will enhance a player's selection of skills based upon their
primary class and the theme of the particular subclass chosen; a mage may
choose to focus on enchanting or using more powerful attack spells, while a
cleric may choose to be a powerful healer or call the wrath of his or her
god to bring powerful destruction.  In contrast, a mage won't be able to
use a Ninja's stealthy abilities or call upon a Shaman's totems.  Some
skills will complement other classes and subclasses, while others will
counteract these skills, ending in (hopefully) a variety of specialization
in skills/builds.

Existing characters are automatically set to the first of the three
subclass choices for their class when first logging in after the subclass
change.
New characters and tiers select a subclass while in the (re-)creation
process.  Characters may also change subclass with the 'subclass' command. 
This may only be used once per 7 days; the time remaining until subclass
may be changed again will show in 'affects'/'saffects'.  Changing subclass
will clear all skills/spells (but not other timers) affecting a player.

Other important information regarding subclasses:

- Subclasses are based on primary class.  Primary class may be changed;
  see 'help classchange'.
- The 'allspells' command (see 'help allspells') will show most subclass
  abilities; however, many classes have additional bonuses integrated into
  other skills/spells.  'help search <subclass>' will help find these extra
  abilities.
- Given the complexity of some changes, certain abilities may come later
  for some subclasses than others.  Efforts will be made to balance new
  additions across all classes (rather than all mage subclasses first,
  for example).
- Except in extreme conditions, game balancing (mob stats, etc.) will wait
  until a majority of the subclass structure is complete.  Raiding is not
  disabled, but is 'at your own risk' until this balancing occurs.

Until otherwise noted, subclasses are still a work in progress.  Any
information or references may be incomplete and/or subject to change. No
purchase necessary.  Void where prohibited.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

A Shiny Hallway
  The walls of the hallway on the Tempest always have bright colors, and are 
bathing in a shiny, mysterious light. Crew members are walking in several 
directions, looking very busy. They keep moving on along the Hall way, and 
never seem to reach their goal.

  You are at the north end of the hallway. There is a stairwell west from you,
which could bring you to several far-away places of the ship. South is the 
way to the ship's entrance, the Imaginarium and the main engineer room. From 
the east you hear the sounds of men and women talking, laughing and eating.

  These stairs lead up to the bridge, where you can introduce yourself to the 
officers. Down are the private rooms, where you might find some of their 
valuable items. All depends upon your purpose here on The Tempest. Thievery 
or bravery? What will it be?

A Stairwell
  The door east leads to the bridge of the ship.  There is much noise
coming from it, so the crew has probably a threatening problem to solve. 
Perhaps you better not go inside, and leave them alone.  They won't have
much time for you anyway.

When you enter the bridge, you notice a large window, filling the north wall.
It must be a thrill to watch all kinds of spectacular things happen through

The West Side of the Bridge
  There are some storm ships in which it is very dark, or where you can see 
white clouds appearing everywhere. The Tempest is surely not one of them.
Every room is brightly lit, the floors swabbed and the brass railings buffed.
Everything is so fine and tidy, it is hard to believe it's a ship that 
traverses the ocean on a storm's leading edge.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

  You look in wonder at the many bright colors in this room.  Even for
Bards there are many.  You see a large man serving customers ahead of you in
the line, each of whom walk away sniffing some unusual and obviously foreign
delicacy.  The only delicacy you can even guess at seems to be a little
carton full of what looks like cheese.  Moving ahead, you can see more of
the back of the stand, in which lies two barrels, which are constantly
making noise which can even be heard over the chatter of the customers.  You
look into the cup of a passing, just-served customer and see that the liquid
is cherry-colored.  The liquid is bubbly and noisy.  In a far corner of the
stand, you see some rocks hopping up and down all by themselves!  In the
other far corner, you see a metal vat, the contents of which are out of your
sight, but you guess is the same as that which lies about it, a
yellow-orange pudding!  As the customer in front of you moves away, you
realize you are next.

The Hall of the Muses (G)
  As you reach the smooth stone floor of the landing, a lighted marble
statue begins to come into view.  You now stand in the presence of the
majestic figure of one of the Bard clan's beloved muses.  Several bards sit
at the base of the effigy, some studying the great writers of the past,
their noses buried in their books.  Others gaze up to the gentle face of
the figure as if trying to pull a bit of inspiration from within her.
Glancing around, you notice other marble figures scattered about the placid
hall.  Great cathedral-like windows adorn the walls of the rounded room
allowing large amounts of light to flood in, helping to light the figures
that stand inbetween each of the windows.  The vaulted ceiling, along with
the four giant marble pillars that reach forever upwards, gives this room a
feel of great importance and reverence.  Amber-colored benches set here and
there seat various bards, scholars and visitors.  The never-ending spiral
staircase ascends toward the ceiling which seems so far away that none
might bother to climb it, save the devoted bards.

The Silver Moon - Musical Supplies and Other Useful Things (G)
  The scent of fir swirls through the air from an alcove where a tree
grows.  Shelves containing all manner of items used to make music are lining
the room.  Various instrument cases of all shapes and sizes rest against the
walls below the shelves.  Taliesin sits in a chair, playing his harp.  He
calls out "Diarmund, Grianne, would you bring me some more light, children?"
A rustling in the fir trees draws your eyes, and two owls emerge and fly
over to Taliesin's upturned palms.  A rainbow of light leaps from his head
and surrounds the owls and his hands, then disappears, leaving only a
glowing ball within them.  As Taliesin shifts the position of his chair to
better use the light, the two owls settle on a stand near him.  Taliesin
radiates gentleness and kindness as he states, "We always have time for the
young, don't we Diarmund and Grianne?  Come in and be welcome."  The two
owls look at each other and nod.

  The room you have entered is unlike any you have seen before.  The golden
light from a set of bronze lanterns suspended from the ceiling reflects off
of hundreds of the highest quality musical instruments hung from the walls,
from the most exotic to the most mundane, shining gold or silver or with the
dull sheen of leather.  The southernmost wall is hung not with instruments
but with hundreds of pages of sheet music of a thousand different styles and
authorships.  As you enter and begin looking about, a middle aged woman with
a swath of silver hair that falls past her waist emerges from a previously
unseen backroom.  Although she is dressed in the robes of a priest or
magician, the calluses on her hands are those of a long time musician.  "How
many I be of services to ye?"  She inquires in a soft, melodic voice.

shops which populate this floor. Bards and other folks mingle in the open
portions of the plaza. The constant drone of crowds is occasionally
punctuated with a louder twang of an off-key instrument. Fewer people
climb the spiral leading up to the next level of the hall. Pale statuary

  The scent of fir swirls through the air from an alcove where a tree
grows.  Shelves containing all manner of items used to make music are lining
the room.  Various instrument cases of all shapes and sizes rest against the
walls below the shelves.  Taliesin sits in a chair, playing his harp.  He
calls out "Diarmund, Grianne, would you bring me some more light, children?"
A rustling in the fir trees draws your eyes, and two owls emerge and fly
over to Taliesin's upturned palms.  A rainbow of light leaps from his head
and surrounds the owls and his hands, then disappears, leaving only a
glowing ball within them.  As Taliesin shifts the position of his chair to
better use the light, the two owls settle on a stand near him.  Taliesin
radiates gentleness and kindness as he states, "We always have time for the
young, don't we Diarmund and Grianne?  Come in and be welcome."  The two
owls look at each other and nod.

The Music Box (G)
  The room you have entered is unlike any you have seen before.  The golden
light from a set of bronze lanterns suspended from the ceiling reflects off
of hundreds of the highest quality musical instruments hung from the walls,
from the most exotic to the most mundane, shining gold or silver or with the
dull sheen of leather.  The southernmost wall is hung not with instruments
but with hundreds of pages of sheet music of a thousand different styles and
authorships.  As you enter and begin looking about, a middle aged woman with
a swath of silver hair that falls past her waist emerges from a previously
unseen backroom.  Although she is dressed in the robes of a priest or
magician, the calluses on her hands are those of a long time musician.  "How
many I be of services to ye?"  She inquires in a soft, melodic voice.

with the rugs strewn across the floor.  What holds your attention, though,
are the costumes.  Rack upon rack of them stand here, filled with clothing
and props from all walks of life the fevered imaginings of some demented
tailor.  A skilled Bard could become any person he chose whithin minutes in
this wonderous room.  A caveman, a warrior, a vagabond, a cow!  The large

  This central location in the tower is brightly lit, though you do not

before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through
the halls, much of it going to the shops on the next floor. Shadows flicker
lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the
south.

Peto's Cornucopia O' Corn (G)
  You look in wonder at the many bright colors in this room.  Even for
Bards there are many.  You see a large man serving customers ahead of you in
the line, each of whom walk away sniffing some unusual and obviously foreign
delicacy.  The only delicacy you can even guess at seems to be a little
carton full of what looks like cheese.  Moving ahead, you can see more of
the back of the stand, in which lies two barrels, which are constantly
making noise which can even be heard over the chatter of the customers.  You
look into the cup of a passing, just-served customer and see that the liquid
is cherry-colored.  The liquid is bubbly and noisy.  In a far corner of the
stand, you see some rocks hopping up and down all by themselves!  In the
other far corner, you see a metal vat, the contents of which are out of your
sight, but you guess is the same as that which lies about it, a
yellow-orange pudding!  As the customer in front of you moves away, you
realize you are next.

The Cloak Room (G)
  At the center of this cloak room is a large, circular coat rack, which is
filled with all manner of outerwear.  Fine fur coats and tailored jackets
hang side by side with travel-stained cloaks and scuffed, crudely tanned
leather overcoats.  Through a gap in the cloaks you see a light flickering.
A closer look reveals a small fire surrounded by a pair of comfortable-
looking benches.  At the foot of a velvet-topped bench is a small fountain,
which bubbles forth fresh orange juice.  Along the walls of the room lie
a multitude of packs, both bulging and empty, some of which lie in the way
of the exits to the northward concession stand and the stairwell to the
west.  However, there are no packs along the southern wall, which is hung
with large, velvet drapes that discreetly cloak another exit to a small
chamber.

  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

A Shiny Hallway
  The walls of the hallway on the Tempest always have bright colors, and are 
bathing in a shiny, mysterious light. Crew members are walking in several 
directions, looking very busy. They keep moving on along the Hall way, and 
never seem to reach their goal.

  You are at the north end of the hallway. There is a stairwell west from you,
which could bring you to several far-away places of the ship. South is the 
way to the ship's entrance, the Imaginarium and the main engineer room. From 
the east you hear the sounds of men and women talking, laughing and eating.

  These stairs lead up to the bridge, where you can introduce yourself to the

valuable items. All depends upon your purpose here on The Tempest. Thievery 
or bravery? What will it be?

A Stairwell
  The door east leads to the bridge of the ship.  There is much noise
coming from it, so the crew has probably a threatening problem to solve. 
Perhaps you better not go inside, and leave them alone.  They won't have
much time for you anyway.

When you enter the bridge, you notice a large window, filling the north wall.
It must be a thrill to watch all kinds of spectacular things happen through 
that window. Hey wait! One just appeared. It seems that you have fallen with 
your nose in the butter!

The West Side of the Bridge
  There are some storm ships in which it is very dark, or where you can see 
white clouds appearing everywhere. The Tempest is surely not one of them.
Every room is brightly lit, the floors swabbed and the brass railings buffed.
Everything is so fine and tidy, it is hard to believe it's a ship that 
traverses the ocean on a storm's leading edge.

Quick Help - How to Remort:

- Go to the remort chamber* to the North-East of Aylor recall.
- Enter 'remort <any class>' to enable remort mode.
- Do any necessary remort auctions.
- When auctions are complete, type 'remort <class>' a second time.

Wishstat and tierstat will need to be re-set upon remorting.


Detailed Help - Aardwolf Remort System:

When you reach SUPERHERO level on Aardwolf, you can continue to gain
trains.  Alternatively, you can choose to be 'reborn' into another class.
What basically happens is that you add another class to your existing set
of skills and spells and restart at level 1.  Because Aardwolf has 7
classes, a player can 'go around' the whole game 7 times.  Since there
is more power to be had, there is also more experience per level to gain as
a tradeoff.

(If playing through 7 classes still isn't enough for you, you can 'tier'
after completing your 7th class, too- see 'help tier' for more information.

There are many features to multiclass playing:

* When you reach the correct level, your existing skills and spells over 
  85% are reset to 85%, or 95% if you have the scholar wish. In the mean 
  time, you gain and practice skills/spells in the new class. 

* Your equipment is retained through each remort (although you must remove
  it from the worn position temporarily during the remort process).

* Your level 201 total stats are saved and restored when you reach level
  201 the next time around. This allows you to try some powerups or
  superhero groups without that time being wasted. See 'help sh-stats' 
  for an explanation of this process.

* Gold, trivia, and quest points are kept. Quest equipment can be 'sold'
  to other players for quest points using remort auctions ('help rauction')
  or long-term market auctions ('help market').

* Online time will remain untouched. 

* Exp required to level increases an extra 1,000 per remort until the
  max for the tier is reached. Full details on exp per level can be
  seen at the bottom of 'help tier'.

* When increasing stats, you will get the primary stat (+5) bonus of all
  your classes.  If you have two classes with the same primary stat, the
  bonus is only given once.  The same applies from level gains- if you have
  mage, thief, and warrior, you will get the highest mana, moves, and hp
  rewards upon level.

* 'Who' and 'Group' will show a 1 letter abbreviation for your class and
  the total number of classes you have. 'whois' and 'finger' will show all
  of your classes.

* Note: Area minimum level locks do not apply to remort characters.

To remort, the following steps are necessary:

1. If you wish to rebuild to a different race, do so before entering remort
   mode.  (Please note that rebuilding is optional and normally only done
   when the player is very unhappy with their current race, primary class,
   or character build.  See 'help rebuild' and 'help classchange'.

2. Go to the Remort Chamber (in the church area just north of recall) and
   type 'remort <classname>'.  At this point the list of commands available
   will be greatly reduced- only commands that you need to continue with
   remort or seek help if necessary will be available.  Type 'commands' to
   see a list of available commands, if necessary.
   
   Once flagged as in remort mode, you may sell quest equipment via remort
   auction (see 'help remort auction') or market (see 'help market').  Note
   that communication is not as easy in remort mode, so get any deals made
   prior to entering remort mode.

3. Type 'remort <class>' a second time to finish the remort process once
   all other items are placed on market or sold on rauction.

Please take a few seconds to very carefully read the messages that the mud
gives you during the remort process.  Unless caused by a bug, any mistakes 
you make during remort will not be reversed by an Imm. 

Keep in mind that when you remort, you are going back to level 1 and your 
item and weight limits will decrease accordingly. It is best to sort out 
any issues relating to this (invis items, etc.) before remorting, rather 
than after, to avoid going over your maximum.

If you have wishstats or tierstats (see 'help tierstat'), you will need to
reassign those again after remort.

* For those who are directionally-challenged: You can runto remort when in
  The Grand City of Aylor, or run 4n2end from recall.

Detailed Help - Aardwolf Tier System:

A person that has reached 7x remort status on Aardwolf and would like to 
continue playing the game, can restart the game and add a 'tier' to their
character. The main benefits of adding an extra tier to your character are
as follows:

- Tiers can wear items and use spells an extra 10 levels higher per tier.
  For example, a tier 2 level 60 player can use spells and wear equipment
  of level 80 or lower.  Note- though spells are available earlier, they
  are NOT cast at the higher level.  (A tier 6 level 50 player casting
  dispel magic as if he/she were level 110 is a bit too much.)

- At level 201, tiers may buy/use quest equipment at their tier level;
  e.g., a tier 1 superhero can buy and use level 211 quest equipment.

- When calculating item allowance, tiers use the higher calculation of
  (tier*25) or (str+(dex/2)).

- Tiers get a -1 bonus to training cost in one stat per tier (see 'help
  tierstat').

- The total stats a player can train (1725) is increased by 25 per tier.

- Tiers gain an additional +2 per tier to maximum trainable caps, to a
  maximum of 400.

- Tiers gain an extra +10 hitroll/damroll and +2 in all stats per tier, in
  the form of a pin worn in a unique slot.
  NOTE: This pin is NOT to be shared with spouses.

- Tiers gain a 10%-per-tier discount on manor purchases and upgrades, up 
  to a maximum of 50%.

- Miracle has an extra 5% chance of success per tier.

- Tiers gain 1 extra quest point per tier when they complete a quest.

- The auction tax is reduced by 1% per tier when selling an item.

- Rankings, swho 9, and similar commands show total levels- a brand new
  tier 1 character shows as 1408 total levels.  Tier 9 players can redo
  tier 9 as many times as they want to increase their total levels, though
  they will not get any other new bonuses.


TRANSFORMATION
When you retier, the following are kept:

- Clan membership, manor ownership, marriage, gold, tp, qp, hours online, 
  war/gquest/death/quest stats and similar character attributes/settings.

The following are reset as if you were a new level 1 character:

- Race/class/subclass/sex (chosen during the tiering process).

- Trains, practices, hp/mana/moves, tierstat/wishstat, skills and spells.

- Traitor/raider/wanted flags are removed.

- Stats are saved until level 201 on your next remort. See 'help 
  sh-stats' for details.

EXPERIENCE
You can use the command 'exptable' to see how experience to the next level
(TNL) changes as you remort and tier. Your current TNL will be highlighted
in red when you use this table.

At tier 0, experience starts at 1,000 TNL and changes to 2,000 after 
remort, but does not increase beyond that.

At tier 1 the base experience starts at 1,000 per level and this increases 
by 1,000 per remort, up to a max of 3,000. This sort of increase continues
each tier, but you will begin at a higher base of experience as you 
progress. So at tier 3, you begin at 3,000 TNL and add 1,000 TNL per
remort to a max of 5,000. At tier 4 you begin at 3,000 but progress to a 
max of 6,000 TNL. By the time you reach tier 9 your experience TNL will be
starting at 7,000 and ending at 10,000.

Tier 9 characters wishing to do the tier again can do so at the experience
cost of 1,000 per level increasing by 1,000 per remort up to a max of 3,000
exp.

HOW TO TIER
After following the steps at the top of this helpfile to enter retier,
you will be brought to the creation screen where you can choose your race
and class; this will look as though you were creating a new character.
When you finish the creation process and reenter the game, you will be the
next tier.

>>    *[NOEXP]* A Shiny Hallway
  The walls of the hallway on the Tempest always have bright colors, and are 
bathing in a shiny, mysterious light. Crew members are walking in several 
directions, looking very busy. They keep moving on along the Hall way, and 
never seem to reach their goal.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
A crew member smiles at you as she passes by.

>>    *[NOEXP]* The Storm Cruiser, Tempest
  Yes indeed, you are now experiencing one of the many great adventures of the

is a big sign for you to read.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Lem-Dagor
  The elvish words for road and battle form the name of this ocean. 
Situated between the violent Alagh and the mysterious Abend, it is less
travelled than Siirima, Iridian or even Haloisi.  Mysterious shadows pass
deep in the water below you.

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance. 

Type 'North' to begin your journey...

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

replay Seriously considering creating a client myself but thinking about the amount of work it 
would take is insane
06 Aug 16:38:42 - Gorsk tells you 'always fun to help a new player who wants to campaign'
06 Aug 16:39:36 - Gorsk tells you 'are you new to mudding or just to aard?'
06 Aug 16:40:22 - Gorsk tells you 'manor costs get discounted with tiers at a rate of 10% per tier
up to a maximum of 50% at tier 5'
06 Aug 16:40:34 - Gorsk tells you 'so you can pay 60 tp for a manor at t0 or 30 at t5'
06 Aug 16:41:32 - Gorsk tells you 'your second mort will increase your power tremendously if i pick
the correct class'
06 Aug 16:41:43 - Gorsk tells you 'if you* pick'
06 Aug 16:42:19 - Gorsk tells you 'i'd suggest warrior for your 2nd class. it has very little skill
overlap with mage'
06 Aug 16:42:35 - Gorsk tells you 'psi as your third and cleric as your fourth'
06 Aug 16:43:19 - Gorsk tells you 'yes but there's a rationale behind it'
06 Aug 16:43:56 - Gorsk tells you 'those are all caster classes and they each come with specific
benefits'
06 Aug 16:44:20 - Gorsk tells you 'cleric and psi are both good but many psi spells are self-only so
you won't be able to get them anywhere else'
06 Aug 16:44:42 - Gorsk tells you 'that's why psi before cleric'
06 Aug 16:45:17 - Gorsk tells you 'the other classes are martial (ranger, thief, paladin) and have
many skills in common with warrior and the casting classes'
06 Aug 16:46:00 - Gorsk tells you 'you won't need any of the combat skills from the others after
taking warrior and there will only be a small number of spells that they'll offer to improve your 
char after getting the casting classes'
06 Aug 16:46:27 - Gorsk tells you 'at t7, you have all the classes, yes. there are only 7 in the
game'
06 Aug 16:46:35 - Gorsk tells you 'err r7, not t7'
06 Aug 16:47:18 - Gorsk tells you 'once you have all 7 classes and get to level 201, you tier up and
start with 1 class again'
06 Aug 16:47:40 - Gorsk tells you 'but your tnl is higher'
06 Aug 16:47:45 - Gorsk tells you 'type exptable'
06 Aug 16:48:24 - Gorsk tells you 'so the higher tier you become, the more xp you need to level up'
06 Aug 16:48:28 - Gorsk tells you 'until you get to redo'
06 Aug 16:48:37 - Gorsk tells you 'a redo is a tier 9 who wants to do more tiers'
06 Aug 16:49:06 - Gorsk tells you 'they don't get extra benefits from having them like lower tiers
do'
06 Aug 16:49:18 - Gorsk tells you 'finger gorsk'
06 Aug 16:49:47 - Gorsk tells you 'i'm endgame'
06 Aug 16:50:18 - Gorsk tells you 'yes, i've done all 9 tiers and then 38 more. i'm on my 39th'
06 Aug 16:50:49 - Gorsk tells you 'people redo to get qp'
06 Aug 16:51:01 - Gorsk tells you 'at superhero, you can only campaign once every 2 hours'
06 Aug 16:51:18 - Gorsk tells you 'so not a ton of qp to be had'
06 Aug 16:51:27 - Gorsk tells you 'and qp requirements at endgame are quite high'
06 Aug 16:51:58 - Gorsk tells you 'i also want to buy good gear but don't want to go to the areas
where it is so i buy it with quest points'
06 Aug 16:52:21 - Gorsk tells you 'a high end piece of gear goes for 30-35k qp'
06 Aug 16:52:50 - Gorsk tells you 'a few days ago, i got 2 ear pieces for 60k qp'
06 Aug 16:53:46 - Gorsk tells you 'not exactly more. you get a bit more with each tier in that you
get 1 extra qp per quest complete'
06 Aug 16:53:55 - Gorsk tells you 'otherwise, it's the same'
06 Aug 16:54:20 - Gorsk tells you 'what you get is game knowledge and kill speed. thus, the ability
to gather qp quickly'
06 Aug 16:54:51 - Gorsk tells you 'type cp today'
06 Aug 16:55:27 - Gorsk tells you 'You have completed 85 campaigns today.'
06 Aug 16:56:05 - Gorsk tells you 'that's how i get qp'
06 Aug 16:56:29 - Gorsk tells you 'i've gathered 2750 qp today'
06 Aug 16:56:39 - Gorsk tells you 'yes'
06 Aug 16:57:05 - Gorsk tells you 'i've gotten 155 levels today'
06 Aug 16:57:40 - Gorsk tells you 'i'll get to 201 and remort some time after the daily campaigns
reset'
06 Aug 16:57:56 - Gorsk tells you 'cause redos get a penalty to qp after they complete 30 campaigns
per day'
06 Aug 16:58:16 - Gorsk tells you 'after 50, we get like 50%'
06 Aug 16:58:26 - Gorsk tells you 'it doesn't go below that'
06 Aug 16:59:03 - Gorsk tells you 'type metarank 18 daily'
06 Aug 17:00:12 - Gorsk tells you 'that's in 1 day'
06 Aug 17:00:48 - Gorsk tells you 'that's why the penalty was put in, the numbers get too high
otherwise'
06 Aug 17:01:24 - Gorsk tells you 'depends on the level. a level 1 campaign i can do in under a
minute. a level 201 one might take 5 minutes'
06 Aug 17:02:04 - Gorsk tells you 'but a level 201 one always has 18 targets'
06 Aug 17:02:34 - Gorsk tells you 'well, assume a full 24 hours of playtime'
06 Aug 17:03:00 - Gorsk tells you 'that's an average of 33.3 campaigns per hour'
06 Aug 17:03:19 - Gorsk tells you 'so just under 2 minutes per'
06 Aug 17:04:10 - Gorsk tells you 'snd or the like'

Help Keywords : Channels.
Help Category : Communication.
Related Helps : Channel Rules, Class Channels, Colorset, Say.
Last Updated  : 2021-01-30 15:35:48.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Syntax: Type 'Channels' to see a list.
              Type [channel name] to toggle on / off.
              Use '[channel] *off [minutes]' to turn off temporarily.
              Use 'channels curse' to see a list of curse allowed channels.
              Use '[channel] -h' or '[channel] -h <# lines / text>' to see 
              channel history.

Further details and other usage options are in the wall of text below.

There are many means of communication on Aardwolf and channels are one of
the most important.  Channels on Aardwolf can change dynamically based on
topics relevant at the time.  To see a list of channels, type 'channels'.
To toggle a channel on or off, type its name.

Each class also has its own private channel which only members of that
class can see. These are covered in 'help class channels'.  Information on
each channel's particular rules and guidelines can be found in 'help 
<channel name>', e.g., 'help racetalk'.

Most channels have a history feature.  To see the history on a channel, use
the syntax '<channelname> -h'.  For example, 'gossip -h 10' will show the
last 10 lines on gossip, while 'answer -h' will show all available lines of
history on the question/answer channel.  You can also use the -h feature to
search for text on a channel; for example, 'gossip -h ivar' will search for
all gossip history containing 'ivar'.  Ignored players (see 'help ignore')
will still show up in channel history.  Note that you can either search or
specify a number of lines, but not both.

To search for a number without the MUD interpreting it as a number of
lines, use the syntax "gossip -h '20'" (this shows all gossip history
containing the number 20).

There are some special commands that can be used on channels to do emotes, 
socials and other actions. Using gossip as an example:

   Use a social on a channel       : gossip *smile
                                     gossip *smile ivar
   Use an emote on a channel       : gossip :emotes something
   Use emote to think on a channel : gossip *think this is cool
   Use emote to say on a channel   : gossip *say say is cool too :)
   Use dice on a channel           : gossip *dice 10 5

The following is a list of channels approved for profane language:

   Clantalk*   Curse       Ftalk       Gclan     Gtell       
   Helper      Immtalk     Mchat       Music     Pokerinfo   
   Spouse      Sports      Debate

* Though the channel is flagged for curse socials, clans may have their own
policies regarding profane language.

The crevasse
  Climbing down the crevasse you are plagued by aftershocks that cause you
to lose your grip.  With each move you set loose rocks tumbling down letting
you know how far you would fall.  Your light begins to illuminate what seems
to be a large hall farther below.  

[ Exits: up down ]
An aftershock from the earthquake attempts to make you fall.

A great hall
  As you pass through a painted ceiling you emerge into a great hall.  
The tiles on the floor seem to make a pattern of some sort but the 
dust makes it hard to see.  Large Ionic pillars line the east and 
west walls of this room.  The southern wall is buried under dirt and 
rocks.  You see a faint light coming from an alcove to the north.  It 
adds an eerie glow to the room.

[ Exits: north up ]

An alcove
  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its
walls are lined by smaller pillars that you saw in the hall.  In the center
there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.  

[ Exits: south ]
(White Aura) A cracked statue is placed here giving off an eerie glow.
A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

The darkside of the coin
  You open your eyes and see you are above the clouds at the base of 
a great citadel.  The beginning of a wicked looking labyrinth looms 
before you.  The sounds of vile creatures that inhabit this place 
reach your ears.  Beyond the labyrinth you can see the tower that 
must hold something of value to have such evil sounding creatures 
guarding it.

  The trees here are still close together but passable.  Carrying on
you can now tell that there is a path.  It seems to be a game trail
leading to a murky pond to the east.  What animals have traveled down
this path?  There seems only one way to find out.

A murky pond
  Surrounding the dark pool of water in the middle of the forest are thorny
vines that move when touched.  Sun-bleached bones lie scattered on the
ground and in the water as well.  Every so often you catch some movement
from the pond out of the corner of your eye.  Perhaps it would be wise not
to linger too long.  

[ Exits: north west ]
     The murky waters of the pond are still and cold.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Nearing the end
  You soon find yourself leaving the forest and nearing what must be the
base of the tower.  You can see from here that the tower is very tall and
lacks any windows.  A wall stops your path unfortunately.  There are giant
double doors that may open a way through the wall.  Maybe if you hit them
with something really heavy.

  This forest seems oddly cheery.  You can hear birds singing and small
woodland animals scurrying around in the underbrush.  The trees have grown
thickly but not enough to block your way.  There seems to be only one thing
lacking - a path.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

better things were in the old days, when there were only three mobs in the
entire MUD, and one of them was Ivar.  You can still hear the faint whining
of issues no one actually cares about any more and the ghosts of inactive
players pop in from time to time to mutter something about all the damn
newbies.  There is a painting of Ivar on the mantle over the fireplace that
all the rocking chairs are crowded around.  In spite of all the chairs here,

Overlooking a Newly Formed Sea (G)
  Gazing out, all you see is an endless expanse of water.  Far, far below
the waves crash against jagged slices of shoreline.  A thin stretch of beach
is barely visible at the base of the cliffs, and that might just be another
being standing at the water's edge.  The main path continues on right over
the cliff's edge, as if there used to be land there and a place for the path
to go.  Looking around for a possible way down, you spy a fresh trail
heading off to the east.

that you previously glimpsed is much clearer, and you can see that it is,
indeed, a person standing on the beach.  Taking a deep breath, you lower
yourself over the edge, determined to ask of this other what has happened

  Dimly lit, this space is close and cramped.  The ceiling seems to press
down upon you.  Reaching up, you feel something odd.  It is a smooth surface,
with what might be a clasp or lock of some kind.  Peering through the murky
darkness, you realize that this is another house, again strangely intact. 
However, whatever force brought this house here hasn't left it unscathed. 
It is actually upside down, lodged between two rocks!  Perhaps you can
explore it further by opening what just might be a window over your head.

Overlooking a Newly Formed Sea (G)
  Gazing out, all you see is an endless expanse of water.  Far, far below
the waves crash against jagged slices of shoreline.  A thin stretch of beach
is barely visible at the base of the cliffs, and that might just be another
being standing at the water's edge.  The main path continues on right over
the cliff's edge, as if there used to be land there and a place for the path
to go.  Looking around for a possible way down, you spy a fresh trail
heading off to the east.

  Here the winds are no longer gentle, and you struggle to maintain your
tenuous perch on the edge of the path.  Downward there seems to be a
possible descent, but can those rocks possibly hold your weight?  The form
that you previously glimpsed is much clearer, and you can see that it is,
indeed, a person standing on the beach.  Taking a deep breath, you lower
yourself over the edge, determined to ask of this other what has happened
to the peaceful village that once stood here.

  The valley you travel through is marred by an opening caused by a
recent earthquake.  The sun casts trails of light that reach deep in
the opening illuminating what appears to be mason work.  Looking in,
you can see that the sides of the crevasse form a rough staircase 
leading into the gloom.

The crevasse
  Climbing down the crevasse you are plagued by aftershocks that cause you
to lose your grip.  With each move you set loose rocks tumbling down letting
you know how far you would fall.  Your light begins to illuminate what seems
to be a large hall farther below.

A great hall
  As you pass through a painted ceiling you emerge into a great hall.  
The tiles on the floor seem to make a pattern of some sort but the 
dust makes it hard to see.  Large Ionic pillars line the east and 
west walls of this room.  The southern wall is buried under dirt and 
rocks.  You see a faint light coming from an alcove to the north.  It 
adds an eerie glow to the room.

[ Exits: north up ]
     One of the small rocks the villager dropped is here. [2/2]
