through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

you wonder what sort of creature dares to exist in the murky depths at the
bottom on the ocean.

  Resting your feet against the ocean floor, you stop and realize that you
do not feel the intense pressure you thought you might at this depth.  You
can move about with relative ease, almost as if on surface.  While relaxing
to strained muscles after the long swim, it is also a curious sensation. 
Looking around in an attempt to survey the vista before you, a dark shadow
of movement above causes you to grasp your weapon just a little more
tightly.  What strange new world have you entered, and are you welcome?

  Burnt by the sun, you stumble blindly onto shimmering salty sands, white

and lone and bare, the salt flats stretch from eye to eye.  Even the air
shimmers in the heat, raising visions of lost temples and strange creatures
long since lost to this world.  Clearly few things you will experience here
will be entirely true to the eye....

Along the Horizon
  You walk for the moment in the shadows created by a great dune, blown up
from the floor of this ancient sea by winds powerful enough to strip flesh
from bone.  You gather your strength and endurance to once more pass from
shadow into the hostile sun.  Each step crunches dryly, crystals shattering
beneath your heel.  You trudge off into the shattering sun.  

[ Exits: north east south up ]
     Glistening crystals of sand dance lightly over your footprints in the dune.
The dust devil scampers through the desert.

>>   The Broadening Horizon
  You have passed from the shadows of the dune to your south, into a great
expanse of...  Nothing.  Just salt, sand, sun and heat pressing down upon
you like some demented god's punishment.  The sweat drips from your face,
sizzling into nothingness upon contact with the cracked dry ground.  Even
the haze seems to be hazy here, flickering and dancing upon the waves of
heat reflected from the salt beneath your feet.  

[ Exits: north east south ]
     The edges of the waterhole are blackened, the water within tepid, dark-colored.
     The sun bleached skull of a longhorn steer is half-buried in the sand, its eyes staring across
the flats.

  From the crest of the dune, you can see for miles around across the
almost absolute horizontal nature of the salt flats.  Small animals can be
seen, avoiding being eaten or seeking something to eat, struggling to
survive on what little this waste provides.  To the northeast a sandstorm
rages, blurring the outlines and making it impossible for you to see any
details of what lies there.  In all other directions, all you can see is
sand and salt and the remains of the victims of thirst and sun.

At the Town Gates of Dharivian
  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

  The labyrinth continues, or at least one might assume so, considering
how difficult it is to see through the night-like darkness all around.  In
this particular stretch of the maze, an obstacle lives in the form of a
large tree-like form.  One might swear to a feeling of being watched by
the...  Oak?  Weeping willow?  Maple?  It's rather hard to discern, until
one spots the pair of bright yellow eyes hidden amongst the leaves.  It does
not seem inclined to move along the corridors to the east and west.  

[ Exits: east west ]
A hippogriff grazes complacently on the fine grass in the labyrinth.
(Invis) A walking barbecue... er, a sprite flits along between the hedges.
The branches of a treant wave lazily in the breeze.

  The labyrinth continues.  It's definitely getting very dark here and
one's hand can barely be seen in front of one's eyes.  The sounds of the
denizens of the maze - screams, growls, even weeping - seem to be louder and
closer than ever.  It's very easy for one's imagination to start working
overtime here and more than one adventurer has sworn a dark shape flew at
him out of the darkness when nothing was there.  One can stumble along to
the east or west from here.

  The labyrinth continues.  This particular section of the maze is one of
the most comfortable - the soft, fine grass is even thicker here, providing a
comfortable bed as well as pillow stuffing, if one is so inclined to create
such.  Only a few deathberries can be glimpsed in the dusky gloam here and
the air is filled with a lovely scent, as of roses.  A twittering of
birdsong floats into the corridor from the hedges.  If you decide to move
on, you can head north, south, or west.

Somewhere in Kansas
  You are somewhere in the middle of Kansas.  All around you are farms
brimming with wheat and animals.  To the west stands a small, plain
farmhouse with a brown roof.  North you see a lush field.  Far to the
northeast you think you see a tornado.

and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north

The hot desert sands
  You stand on the scorching sands of the great desert.  To the south the
endless wastes stretch out to eternity.  To the north rises a large stone
structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north
towards the temple.

Syntax: cast scry <target>
Spell Number: 236

Using this ancient art, a high-powered spellcaster can magically spy upon
others from afar.  The target will only sense a presence, but will never know
who exactly it was.  However, some characters have been able to wish for the
ability to see who is scrying them, and the caster will never be quite sure
who has been granted this wish.

Primary Stats: Int, Wis, Luck.

  Closing your eyes, you feel yourself being transported into a new world,
one of fantasies both good and bad.  The Fantasy Fields stretch in many
directions, encompassing visions of delight and horror.  Where you stand,
the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

  Soft breezes sway the long grasses invitingly.  A slight scent of seawater
drifts from the north where you can just see a rocky outcropping.  Looking

was once a quaint little village here.  A well-trodden path leads north
towards the sound of waves crashing against rocks.

Overlooking a Newly Formed Sea (G)
  Gazing out, all you see is an endless expanse of water.  Far, far below
the waves crash against jagged slices of shoreline.  A thin stretch of beach
is barely visible at the base of the cliffs, and that might just be another
being standing at the water's edge.  The main path continues on right over
the cliff's edge, as if there used to be land there and a place for the path
to go.  Looking around for a possible way down, you spy a fresh trail
heading off to the east.

  Here the winds are no longer gentle, and you struggle to maintain your

possible descent, but can those rocks possibly hold your weight?  The form
that you previously glimpsed is much clearer, and you can see that it is,
indeed, a person standing on the beach.  Taking a deep breath, you lower
yourself over the edge, determined to ask of this other what has happened
to the peaceful village that once stood here.

  A shallow ledge allows you to pause to take a deep breath.  Screeching

trembling fingers are torn and bleeding from scrambling for purchase on the

The beach stretches out before you, inviting you to stroll along and
discover the local flora and fauna.  Everywhere you see rampant signs of
flourishing life.  Tide pools teem with small, scurrying creatures and
shells glisten in the sunlight.  All in all, it is a rather picturesque
place.  Further ahead you can make out with certainty the form of a little
green man gazing out over the waters.  Maybe now you can finally find out

  The warm sands cushion your steps as you wander closer to the shoreline. 
There seems to be an abundance of life everywhere...  The sands are patterned
with strange, wavering lines, as if something has crawled from the sea to
further up the beach.  All around you are misshapen lumps of sand, and to
the north a large lump seems to be attracting the attention of quite a few
of the gulls.

  Finally, you have reached the water's edge.  Here stands the man you saw

back out to the turbulent sea, his face sinking into an expression of deep
sadness.  Looking past him, you see a drop off in the shoreline.  There is a
faint luminescence in the water, almost as if a path has been outlined on
the sea's floor.  Perhaps a closer look is worthwhile.

Before the entrance to the Underdark
  You stand before a huge door.  The corridor can easily fit fifteen humans
standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

A Crack in the Rock
  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.  

[ Exits: up down ]
A deathly pale man looks around anxiously.

  Working your way down deeper into the crack, you gain some breathing room

random arrangement of rock?  Or does it include an element of design?  You
note the beautiful moss growing on the walls.

  You stand on the scorching sands of the great desert.  To the south the
endless wastes stretch out to eternity.  To the north rises a large stone
structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north
towards the temple.

Entrance
  You stand in the shade of the temple entrance.  To the south the sun
blazes relentlessly onto the desert sand.  To the north lies the dark and
forbidding entrance to the temple.  From deep within the deserted catacombs
blows a slight breeze, as though the temple were breathing.  The air wafting
from the entrance smells of centuries of decay.  You wonder which is worse,
the hot blazing sun, or the stench of decay coming from within the
synagogue?

A long corridor
  You stand in a long dark corridor.  Dust and sand lie in drifts on the
floor, blown in by the desert wind.  Your footsteps echo hollowly from the
dark stone walls, or is there someone following you?  No, it's just an echo. 
The corridor continues north and south.

any direction.

Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to

kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a

laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered

intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Welcome to Grandmarket Boulevard! (G)
  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:

  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

Approaching a small mine shaft
  After having spent some time in the dirty, run down settlement of
Sargasso, you realize that the only thing the prospectors have is mining. 
They left their families and decided to dedicate themselves to one single
task.  The wind starts to pick up a little and the weird dirt-stuff flies
around for a little bit, but the gusts are not nearly as horrible as when
you were walking upon the mountain.  Still, the smell of charred flesh,
which was absent to the north, lingers on here.  What could these miners be
doing to paint such a horrid picture of the town?  You shrug off the
question, thinking it could not possibly be on purpose.  To the west you see
a beautifully colored hut and wonder why something so vibrant would be in a
place of such death and misery.

  Rotting oak posts support the ceiling of this very old looking mine

to the fact that Sargasso is a relatively new settlement.  How odd.  Maybe
there's something more to the mineshaft ...  something beautiful, yet
forgotten for countless ages.  The upper level of the mine shaft continues

Exploring underground
  This mine shaft is certainly much bigger than you thought it would be! 
It appears that the Sargasso miners certainly found a bit more than ore when
they dug deep inside the ground.  The underground caverns seem almost
endless, and you can't help but notice that they seem to be very ancient,
unlike the relatively new mine shaft.  You can climb back up the rope to the
mining settlement, but you get the feeling that it would be much nicer to
explore underground instead.  Paths spiral off in each direction, and you
really don't know which would be the best way to go.  Tiny little runes are
carved inside one of the cavern's walls in runny black ink.  Maybe coming to
Sargasso wasn't such a huge waste after all.

Farther into the Hills
  The road leads further into the hills.  To the north and west of here
are huge mountains, which rise up sharply.  These are the legendary Teeth of
the Northwest.  To the south, a wide panorama opens up, and the Western High
Road reaches off to the horizon.

Edge of the Mountains
  The hills are turning into mountains here, and trees are replacing what
was once grassland on both sides of the road.  The road is degenerating into
nothing but a rocky path, and the way is hard going.  A breeze whistles
through the pines here, and the entire scene looks as if it belongs on a
postcard one might send to a Aylor relative.

Quanah Parker says, "There's been a pissing match going on between

 bigger than the bee's knees.  Back then, Mrs. James, their mama, doted on
 the Marshall.  His younger brother, Jake, was pretty much left to his own
 devices, and spent his time killing off pet cats and pulling the wings
 offa flies."

Road to the City of Gold
  The road plows deeper into the mountains.  To all sides are the sharp
peaks of the Teeth of the Northwest.  The trees are beginning to get
shorter, and the air a bit colder here.  Not too far ahead is a ridge.

Road to the City of Gold
  The road crests a ridge here and suddenly descends into a lowland
valley.  A city can be seen at the bottom of the valley, immediately ahead
of you on the road.  Most of the buildings appear to be made of wood, and
even at this distance appear to have been built quite hastily.

  The road descends the slope into the valley rapidly here, and is quite
dangerous.  Loose rocks threaten any foothold, and a few cacti line the edge
of the road.  Obviously, this side of the ridge gets much less rain than the
southern side.

the air.  Small three-toed footprints can be found in the dust over the
flagstones alongside large five-toed ones.  A variety of species have
passed through to go down the steps.  Perhaps they knew the secret of the
guards.

A guard with entirely too much muscle watches every move made by those around him.

  A short flight of flagstone stairs end here in a dusty stairwell. Garbled 
voices, music and the pounding of feet come from above. The steps are covered
in a thin layer of stone dust, and upon closer inspection, reveals cloven 
hoofprints of some kind. The stairs lead upwards, and there is a short 
passageway and a door to the south.

Corridor of Lies
  The Corridor of Lies is bleak.  Only the Boss can answer the needs of
supplicants seeking help.  Debts will create bigger debts.  Small torches
light the walls on both sides.  To go forward is only to go towards the
answer.

  Finally, the corridor seems to be ending.  To the south, a rough wood
door marks a change against the cold concrete that surrounds the rest of the
hall.  The door has an ornate symbol on it.  The symbol itself is five
braids twisted in an odd fashion.  There seems to be more tension here than
anywhere else in the area.

Corridor of Lies
  This corridor leads deeper and deeper into the secret rooms of the Boss's
organization.  Although known topside as an upstanding member of society,
often showing moral fortitude and kind philanthropy, those in the know
recognize in the Boss a scoundrel who lies and cheats with the best of them.
The corridor leads west towards his offices.

Gilded hallway
  This hallway is decorated more nicely than what has been seen so far.  It
appears that beyond here, for those who make it, is where the priciest of
transactions take place.  Slaves whose sole purpose in this world is to keep
this hallway clean spend hours on their knees, scrubbing every inch of
floor.  There are slits within the wall, designed to be money-drops for
large sums of cash.  It's obvious a large amount of money makes its way
through here daily.

  There is a great deal of evidence in this room indicating it is used for

mind-numbingly unbearable.  Portions of bodies, many of which are
unrecognizable beyond being bloody chunks, are scattered about.  The walls
seem to still reverberate with the sound of pained screams.  The longer a
body lingers in this room, the more discomforting it becomes.  This can be a

The Boss's Corner
  This corner in the pits is occupied by the largest thug yet.  There
exists around here a strange quiet as compared to neighboring rooms.  It
appears that even the walls anticipate the coming confrontation.  The room
seems to shrink as it darkens with the shadows.  

[ Exits: south west up ]
This thug appears to be an even bigger bully than the rest.

  A stone arch, covered in strange, undecipherable runes, adorns this nook
of the caverns.  A latched door at your feet opens downwards to a set of
decrepit stairs.  Another door, marked "Overseer", opens to the south.

A Choice
  The cavern walls are narrow here, with barely room to move forward or
back.  To the east, a disturbing whimpering can be heard.  To the west,
silence.  A decision must be made: to continue west, into the deepest depths
of these caverns, or to head east, perhaps to escape these caves forever.

  Children stolen from local playgrounds are tied and bound in this area.

is left are stolen moments.  Perhaps the buyer will not choose one today.

  A small fire ahead lights the room warmly.  There appears to be a stone
counter and a scratched and stained stool behind it, but no one to help run
the place.  A glass block in the counter allows the viewing of various
scrolls.  Unlike the usual scrolls one sees, these are stained black with
red writing and are burned at the edges.  A small sign says "Buyer Beware -
Scrolls not guaranteed."

  Another room which has the air of enforcement about it, this dimly lit
place leaves the scent of sweat heavy in the nostrils.  Dark red stains on
the walls and floors leave no doubt that this is a place where one's guard
should never be let down.  The sounds here are more subdued, having left the
hectic market and other distractions above.  Serious business is
accomplished in these halls, and there is no doubt as to the penalty for
causing mischief.

  Another room which has the air of enforcement about it, this dimly lit
place leaves the scent of sweat heavy in the nostrils.  Dark red stains on
the walls and floors leave no doubt that this is a place where one's guard
should never be let down.  The sounds here are more subdued, having left the
hectic market and other distractions above.  Serious business is
accomplished in these halls, and there is no doubt as to the penalty for
causing mischief.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

On a jungle path
  Here at the edge of the village, the jungle is a less dense.  The human
sounds have receded and animal sounds have emerged.  You barely hear the
shouts of children playing to the north.

brightly colored birds are sharp notes against the soothing drone of
insects.

  The path starts to rise and the ground is a bit drier as you travel into
the foothills.  Less brush blankets the ground and the trees are further
apart, allowing more sun to penetrate.  There is still plenty of shade and a
cool breeze blows down from the high mountain peaks.

  The path is a lot steeper here and the dirt of the jungle has given away
to packed gravel.  The surrounding foliage is still thick, but a lot more

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

  This village sure is not very big!  At this end, it backs right up
against the jungle.  Maybe a dozen huts can be seen from here, a few with
their doors open.  Women cook and sew while the men hunt or tend the fields.
Boys fetch water from the river and girls take care of their younger
siblings.  Everyone is busy.

  The path starts to rise and the ground is a bit drier as you travel into
the foothills.  Less brush blankets the ground and the trees are further
apart, allowing more sun to penetrate.  There is still plenty of shade and a
cool breeze blows down from the high mountain peaks.

On an old bridge
  Here is the most dilapidated bridge you have ever seen!  Its weathered
grey planks are splintered and broken and more than half of them are
missing.  You look over the edge to see the rotting pilings sunk deep into
the mud banks.  Apparently, there is no other way across.  Gathering your
courage, you take one slow, careful step out onto the bridge.  It shudders
and groans under your weight.  I hope you make it across!

might be best to avoid that snow. The trail seems to end here, but if you 
climb up the trail continues there.

  This section of the trail is covered with a deep snow, making it difficult to
walk. Icy patches cover the ground underneath the snow. Long icicles hang 
from the rocks above. Smoke rises into the air from somewhere to the 
northwest. The trail continues to the north or you will have to climb back 
down.

A turn in the path
  You arrive at a turn in the path. The path to the west leads down to a little
cabin. Some smoke drifts from the cabin, ensuring that a warm fire is lit.
In contrast, the snowy bleakness of the eastern path continues up the 
mountain. The sun shines overhead causing a strong glare from all the snow.

creating a barrier from the elements. It also deadens the other sounds, which

Vast plains open to the east, where the icy winds blow.

The twin pines
  You are standing before a tall pine tree. Legend has it that this tree was 
planted with its twin to celebrate the life and love of Rythemus and Lantana.
They died tragically in this spot. Upon their death the land grew cold and 
barren. Their friend, Thylinimus, planted these two trees as a memorial, and 
the trees immediately began to grow. These two trees still survive as a 
symbol of their love and devotion to each other - one of the signs of hope on
this desolate tundra.

  The winds continue to swirl junk around you.  There is still no way to
get down, but as you are getting the hang of navigating the tornado, you can
move from side to side as you wish.

  You find yourself in the middle of the tornado.  You see junk whirling
all around you-- except to the northeast.  The air is clear there.  That's
decidedly odd...  Maybe you should go check it out.

  To the north, you hear something odd: silence.  Utter silence-- in a
tornado?  This really must be a magic tornado!  You wonder what's over
there.

Under a Magic Portal
  Your ears and eyes have gotten so used to the noise and dust, it takes
you a moment to adjust.  The air here is perfectly clean and silent, and you
don't know what's holding you up.  Right over your head is a shimmering
connection to...  somewhere...

  You find yourself...  Somewhere.  That was definitely a magic tornado. 
Above you, you see a round gateway to a pretty land with blue skies and
white clouds.  You poke at the space below you, but there is no sign of the

  You don't know where you are, but you don't think you're in
Kansas anymore.  To the north, you see an odd little garden with small
people dancing in it.  Since, once again, you can't go back the way you
came, you decide to press on northward.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Entrance to the Ponds
  The caverns of the first level serve as the administrative center for the 
Kobaloi Fishing Service. The service is responsible for handing out fishing 
permits, monitoring stocks, and work with the Kobaloi Guard to catch thieving
poachers who slip into the caverns to fish illegally. There are sign posts 
everywhere, stating 'Fishing License Required'.

Lair of the Blithersnag
  This is just a typical blithersnag lair.  It's fairly cozy, with a pile
of animal furs in one corner to sleep on.  Bones of unlucky travelers can
also be seen scattered about.  A couple of males work while the female roars
and snorts.  You hope she doesn't see you.

The Puppet and the Dwarf
  What an odd place to find a tavern.  But that is exactly what this seems
to be.  Or at least half a tavern.  A bar is cut into the rock and a rusty

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley

pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The northeast corner of the Grand Plaza is dominated by the Clerics'
Guild--The Tower of Life--to the north and the smallest of the eight
towers--The Helpers' Headquarters--to the east.  Vines budding with a
variety of flowers wind their way up the Clerics' tower, each blossom alive
with vibrant color.  The Helper building is the most understated of all
those lining the Grand Plaza, and yet it completes the symmetry of the
square perfectly.  The so-called Eighth Tower is overlooked by many, but all
would miss it if it were gone.  Vendors here shout advertisements for a
variety of exotic curatives, claiming to soothe every ill from a runny nose
to Nanjiki jungle rot.  Guards flank the entrances to the Guilds, letting
only the worthy pass.

  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>
Spell Number: 41

Unlike the specialized enchanter spells; the "enchant weapon" ability is a 
general enchantment available to most magic users.

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its hit roll and damage
roll bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as
the weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one... reducing the level again would be very costly and, 
most likely, not recommended!

Casters who are extremely lucky have a small chance of getting a 'golden'
enchant, which will have the possibility of adding a stat (intelligence,
wisdom, or luck) to the weapon. A golden enchant adds the glow flag so it
is not recommended to use this spell on an item you would like to fully
enchant later.

Primary stat: Intelligence and Luck

The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

>>   North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

To the south, you gaze upon a large plaza with eight silver spires piercing

Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

help practice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Practice.
Help Category : Utility.
Related Helps : Learned, Showskill, Train.
Last Updated  : 2016-04-28 17:48:01.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax: practice
        practice <skill|spell name>
        practice <skill|spell name> full

Practice with no argument displays your current skill percentages. It also
displays the spell number (Sn - see 'help cast'), any skillspell modifiers 
from equipment, and the minimum level to use the skill. To see all learned 
skills/spells, not just those which are able to be practiced, see 'help 
learned'.

The more common use for the practice command is to gain proficiency in
your skills and spells. Your abilities can only be practiced at trainers
such as the guildmasters in Aylor. See 'help find' for a quick way to
local guildmasters in Aylor. Other trainers also exist, especially within 
public areas of clan halls, though there is no way to directly determine 
what may or may not be a trainer.

Skills that are newly learned start at 1%. Practicing a skill/spell will
increase the percentage, up to a maximum of 85%, or 95% with the Scholar
wish - see 'help wish'.  The amount gained from each practice session will
vary, based upon the skill/spell and your Intelligence. Using the 'full'
option will use as many practice sessions as necessary to fully practice
a skill, or adding 'full check' will show how many practice sessions
that will cost.

For example:

   practice immolate full check

Gives:
 
   It will cost you 3 practices to increase immolate to 85%.
   You have 21 practice sessions available.

Unused practices are saved until remort/tier.  Practiced skills/spells are 
reset to 1% upon tier, and usually upon rebuild (see 'help rebuild').

Casting spells / using skills are the only way to increase their practiced
amounts beyond 85/95%.  Note that the practiced percentage of a skill/spell
is only the chance to use it successfully (not lose concentration, etc.);
whether the skill/spell succeeds in what you intended it to do is based
upon the specific ability.

Spells/skills that are considered nofail (see 'help nofail') will not lose
concentration or miss.  Instead, these skills use the practiced percentage
to determine the amount of damage dealt.  This percentage may increase past
100%.

Racial skills/spells will work at a specific percentage, but will increase
above that level through use if the skill is learned.  For example, if a 
vampire's untrained Intimidate skill is 60%, a vampire mage will be able 
to use intimidate at that 60% level.  A vampire warrior who just gained 
the intimidate skill has it at 1% practiced, but will use it at the 
effective racial level of 60%.  If the skill is practiced to 75%, it will 
then be used at the higher 75% practiced level.

You can convert training sessions to practices and vice versa using the
'train' command in your guild.  See 'help train'.

Boot Clan Public Hall (G)
  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
A commissary shopkeeper stands here, begging you to type 'list'.
