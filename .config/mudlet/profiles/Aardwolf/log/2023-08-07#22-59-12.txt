Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
Entrance to Throne Room
  At last, you stand before the Emperor's throne room.  But, scared as you
are of authority, perhaps you shouldn't bug him.  Maybe you should come back
later, he's probably sleeping on his throne or starting a war or something. 
Or maybe you should just burst in and start with the questions, either way,
you gotta find out what you are doing here on Earth Plane 4 and what Chosen
are.  Actually, the name Chosen doesn't sound as bad now that you think of
it, perhaps it means you're special...

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

Related Helps : Channel Rules, Class Channels, Colorset, Say.
Last Updated  : 2021-01-30 15:35:48.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Syntax: Type 'Channels' to see a list.
              Type [channel name] to toggle on / off.
              Use '[channel] *off [minutes]' to turn off temporarily.
              Use 'channels curse' to see a list of curse allowed channels.
              Use '[channel] -h' or '[channel] -h <# lines / text>' to see 
              channel history.

Further details and other usage options are in the wall of text below.

There are many means of communication on Aardwolf and channels are one of
the most important.  Channels on Aardwolf can change dynamically based on
topics relevant at the time.  To see a list of channels, type 'channels'.
To toggle a channel on or off, type its name.

Each class also has its own private channel which only members of that
class can see. These are covered in 'help class channels'.  Information on
each channel's particular rules and guidelines can be found in 'help 
<channel name>', e.g., 'help racetalk'.

Most channels have a history feature.  To see the history on a channel, use
the syntax '<channelname> -h'.  For example, 'gossip -h 10' will show the
last 10 lines on gossip, while 'answer -h' will show all available lines of
history on the question/answer channel.  You can also use the -h feature to
search for text on a channel; for example, 'gossip -h ivar' will search for
all gossip history containing 'ivar'.  Ignored players (see 'help ignore')
will still show up in channel history.  Note that you can either search or
specify a number of lines, but not both.

To search for a number without the MUD interpreting it as a number of
lines, use the syntax "gossip -h '20'" (this shows all gossip history
containing the number 20).

There are some special commands that can be used on channels to do emotes, 
socials and other actions. Using gossip as an example:

   Use a social on a channel       : gossip *smile
                                     gossip *smile ivar
   Use an emote on a channel       : gossip :emotes something
   Use emote to think on a channel : gossip *think this is cool
   Use emote to say on a channel   : gossip *say say is cool too :)
   Use dice on a channel           : gossip *dice 10 5

The following is a list of channels approved for profane language:

   Clantalk*   Curse       Ftalk       Gclan     Gtell       
   Helper      Immtalk     Mchat       Music     Pokerinfo   
   Spouse      Sports      Debate

* Though the channel is flagged for curse socials, clans may have their own
policies regarding profane language.

Help Keywords : Socials.
Help Category : Communication.

Last Updated  : 2020-03-25 19:59:29.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:

    socials                  : Displays all socials.
    socials <string>         : Displays socials with given string.
    random                   : Uses a random social.


Summary:

Type 'socials' to get a list. 
Type a social name to use it. 
Type 'social [target]' to use a social on someone else.
Type 'gossip *smile' to use the smile social on the gossip channel.

Detail:

Socials are a pre-set list of various actions that may either have no 
target (*nod = "You nod.") or target yourself or another player/monster
(*nod ivar  = "You nod at Ivar."). 

To see a complete list of socials, type 'socials'.  To search the socials
file for a specific word, use 'socials <word>'.  To see the specific
actions a specific social will do, use 'shelp <social>' (see 'help shelp').

You may also use 'random' instead of a specific social to use a random
social from the list.

For information on how to use socials on channels, see 'help channels'.

If a game command and a social overlap (e.g., 'poker' command vs. 'poke'
social), prefix the social with a * (like '*poke ivar').

Note: Curse-only socials (see 'help nocurse') will only work on channels;
they do not work in rooms.

The 'strictsocials' command sets your character so that you have to use the
'*' prefix to social someone. This is to help reduce the number of socials 
caused by typos. The current 'strictsocials' setting can be seen by typing 
'config all'.

You hear the distant thunder of hooves as the wind sighs through the grasslands.

(WanGrp?!) [L191,289,T+4/T2] LiamSmythe peers around himself intently.

(WanGrp?!) [L4,2229,C+5/T9] Havvoc raises his hand.

Kittenbane gossips 'hey, guys. I'm kinda... maybe not smart. could someone explain to me the

activate?'

Kittenbane gossips 'hey, genuine question for you, Zolariz. why are you here?'

Zolariz gossips 'in this conversation or on this mud?'

Kittenbane gossips 'on the mud. it's been made clear that your preferred way of playing isn't
allowed'

Zolariz gossips 'actually its been made clear that your sense of reality isn't what you have been
thinking it is'
Kittenbane gossips 'so what are you hoping to get out of being here?'

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

In tall grass
  The grass on the plains grows tall here, well over four feet in height. Cool 
breezes stir the blades of verdant vegetation, causing them to wave and 
rustle. The ground underfoot is soft, giving slightly, and the smell of mud is
strong on the air. The sounds of buzzing insects and chirping birds can be 
heard all around. To the east the grassland seems to give way to fields, and 
you think you can see a meandering lane, however that looks too much like 
civilization to investigate just now.

[ Exits: north south west ]
Pesky but tiny, a swarm of gnats whizzes around the plains.
Keeping close to its mother, a longhorn calf looks at you cautiously.
Pale cream in color, a moth feeds on the flowers of the plains.

Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
In tall grass
  The grass on the plains grows tall here, well over four feet in height. Cool 
breezes stir the blades of verdant vegetation, causing them to wave and 
rustle. The ground underfoot is soft, giving slightly, and the smell of mud is
strong on the air. The sounds of buzzing insects and chirping birds can be 
heard all around. To the east the grassland seems to give way to fields, and 
you think you can see a meandering lane, however that looks too much like 
civilization to investigate just now.

on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

be noticed. East is the engineer room of Lt. Commander Finn Yeoma. A

A Shiny Hallway
  You stand between two doors, which are east and west of you. West you can 
enter the sickbay of Dr. Fyrne Oribror, where a typical 'hospital' smell can 
be noticed. East is the engineer room of Lt. Commander Yeoma. A 'buzzing' 
sound can be heard from there. The hallway leads north and 
south..............Hey wait a minute........... What is that sound coming 
from the engineer room? Something is definitely wrong there! And what is this
screaming from Fyrne's sick bay?

A Shiny Hallway
  This part of the hallway is damaged very badly. It seems like a total war is 
going on in the ship. West is the entryway and east the Imaginarium. North is
the way to the stairs. Everywhere there is chaos. People are running, some 
towards battle and some, fearfully away from battle.

  This part of the ship is not as busy as other regions, so it seems not
that important.  From here, the hallway continues to the north, to much more
common places.  You can also go west, but it's not clear where this will
lead you.  You see a lamp and siren on the ceiling.

A security officer here is on weapon's detail in response to the klaxon.

A Shiny Hallway
  You stand between two doors, which are east and west of you. West you can 
enter the sickbay of Dr. Fyrne Oribror, where a typical 'hospital' smell can 
be noticed. East is the engineer room of Lt. Commander Yeoma. A 'buzzing' 
sound can be heard from there. The hallway leads north and 
south..............Hey wait a minute........... What is that sound coming 
from the engineer room? Something is definitely wrong there! And what is this
screaming from Fyrne's sick bay?

  This part of the hallway is damaged very badly. It seems like a total war is 
going on in the ship. West is the entryway and east the Imaginarium. North is
the way to the stairs. Everywhere there is chaos. People are running, some 
towards battle and some, fearfully away from battle.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

The Storm Cruiser, Tempest
  Yes indeed, you are now experiencing one of the many great adventures of the 
Storm Ships of Lem-Dagor. Of course this is the famous cruiser, Tempest, 
where your voyage begins. Look around, look at everything for a clue. There 
is a big sign for you to read.

[ Exits: east west ]
     A gangway leads to an unknown ship.
Bosun Tofi stands by.
Bosun Tofi says, "Welcome aboard The Tempest, KumoGami."

A Shiny Hallway
  The walls of the hallway on the Tempest always have bright colors, and are 
bathing in a shiny, mysterious light. Crew members are walking in several 
directions, looking very busy. They keep moving on along the Hall way, and 
never seem to reach their goal.

enter the sickbay of Dr. Fyrne Oribror, where a typical 'hospital' smell, can
be noticed. East is the engineer room of Lt. Commander Finn Yeoma. A 
'buzzing' sound can be heard from there. The hallway leads north and south.

  This part of the ship is not as busy as other regions, so it seems not
that important.  From here, the hallway continues to the north, to much more
common places.  You can also go west, but it's not clear where this will
lead you.  You see a lamp and siren on the ceiling.

[07 Aug 11:33:23] KumoGami Tech: .myalias* - where myalias is your alias obviously. in short prepend
with "." to set a new value for alias. Since they can replace text mid-line as well, they act as 
variables
[07 Aug 11:34:03] Yerald Tech: what might that actualy look like?
[07 Aug 11:35:07] KumoGami Tech: Example, I have an alias "ctgt", then I have a button that has the
command ".kb popup .ctgt ". That makes the keyboard popup, with the input prefilled with ".ctgt ". 
then I enter a new target and it saves the "ctgt" alias to become the new value
[07 Aug 11:35:41] KumoGami Tech: Which you can use in other buttons, etc... So I have buttons for
"where ctgt" "hunt ctgt" etc
[07 Aug 11:36:36] Yerald Tech: intresting... I wonder if I could remake my current script for
blowtorch...
[07 Aug 11:37:47] KumoGami Tech: Not sure about full-blown scripting, but you can definitely get
some nice stuff done that way, like I said I have this setup for targets and I also have attack 
buttons that use that target specifically to start a battle on them etc
[07 Aug 11:42:35] KumoGami Tech: Yeah unfortunately I don't think you can really port stuff over
automatically, especially since there's no real scripting support for BlowTorch

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

A crack in the valley floor
  The valley you travel through is marred by an opening caused by a
recent earthquake.  The sun casts trails of light that reach deep in
the opening illuminating what appears to be mason work.  Looking in,
you can see that the sides of the crevasse form a rough staircase 
leading into the gloom.

The crevasse
  Climbing down the crevasse you are plagued by aftershocks that cause you
to lose your grip.  With each move you set loose rocks tumbling down letting
you know how far you would fall.  Your light begins to illuminate what seems
to be a large hall farther below.

The tiles on the floor seem to make a pattern of some sort but the 
dust makes it hard to see.  Large Ionic pillars line the east and 
west walls of this room.  The southern wall is buried under dirt and 
rocks.  You see a faint light coming from an alcove to the north.  It 
adds an eerie glow to the room.

An alcove
  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its
walls are lined by smaller pillars that you saw in the hall.  In the center
there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.  

[ Exits: south ]
(White Aura) A cracked statue is placed here giving off an eerie glow.
A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

The lightside of the coin
  Staring out across the edge of the citadel you can see the land of
Aardwolf whisking by.  You can hear the joy and feel the warmth from within
the small town that lies to the north.  Looking up into the clouds, past the
city, you see the goal of this journey.  Somewhere in that tower lies the
relic you seek.

A back alley
  The way you came is now gone and you find yourself in a back alley.  The
alley walls are high and too flat to get any traction to climb.  The ground
has garbage on it; luckily not much light gets back here so it is not
rotten.  Noises come to you from the opening leading from the alley into the
main part of town.

  Lone and bare, the level sands stretch and twist to the edges of

this desert sea.  Ancient bleached bones sit like shipwrecks high upon the
rocks that thrust through the sandy waves, beckoning like sirens of old
those weary travellers to their thirsty doom.  A cracked and ancient road
rides through the wastes like a bridge over a troubled sea, twisting on
motionless waves of sand until it disappears into the haze of the east.  
A small weather beaten and blasted marker sits half buried by the all
encompassing sands.  Its barely legible words state '20 miles to Reme.'

  Like a madman's fairytale, crazed white marbled towers jut out of a grey
granite base.  Pleasure domes break the composure of gingerbread minarets,
and stately towers are mocked by balcony-studded masses of rare stones and
metals.  Only one place could be so mad and extravagant, only one place
ruled by generations of men with power, and not necessarily taste or good

wastes about you.  A few sullen vultures sit upon the pole, regarding you
strangely as you peer into the rusting iron of the cage and notice bleached
bones and rags that tell of past meals for these scavengers of the sky. 
Sand blasted expanses of road lead off in all directions, and along the one
to your east you can see the hazy spires of a mighty city thrusting upwards

  Dry shrubs blow in the slow wind, in ruts left by long ago wagons.  A
thousand feet in marching rhythm have pounded the soil into a fine mist of
white dry dust, blanketing all it touches, while the remnants of tracks tell
well the story of mining sledges carrying ore to nearby Reme.  Precious is
that ore, the lifeblood of Reme, paid for in miner's lives and sweat, deep
below these sandy hills.  All gone now, as the shattered shells of soldiers

blazes relentlessly onto the desert sand.  To the north lies the dark and
forbidding entrance to the temple.  From deep within the deserted catacombs
blows a slight breeze, as though the temple were breathing.  The air wafting
from the entrance smells of centuries of decay.  You wonder which is worse,
the hot blazing sun, or the stench of decay coming from within the
synagogue?

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance. 

Type 'North' to begin your journey...

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

courtyard begins to really open up.  From here you can see the western and
eastern pillars just fine, but the southern pillar seems almost miles away. 
You are amazed at the diversity of people in this place.

(Golden Aura) A townswoman is here trying to get someone to notice her.

  The pathway splits off here beneath a canopy.  Most of the local traffic
seems to come to a head in this part of the courtyard.  There is an elderly
woman here trying to peddle what goods and trinkets she has.  Perhaps it
would be a good idea to see what she has to offer.

  The brick pathway leads both north and south from here, but there is no

on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

  You are outside the front door of a two-story house. There are large bay 
windows on either side of the door. The left side of the house has a metal 
fire escape from the first floor into the rear garden. On the central part of
the roof sits a spire with a wind vane in the shape of a cat. A three foot 
high white picket fence encloses the decking that is on the outside of the

on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Military Surplus Store (G)
  You have entered a warehouse filled with military gear. Heaps of battered 
helmets and other miscellanea lay scattered randomly around the warehouse.
Dust covers much of it, tickling your nostrils, and making you want to 
sneeze. As you make your way down the ragtag aisles you finally stumble upon
the front desk. An old man with one eye stares at you. Better make it quick 
he doesn't seem to have much patience. Type list to view its wares.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

## You are dehydrated; your healing is greatly reduced.
INFO: Bonus experience has now expired.

There is a loud scream and a flare of light shoots towards the sky.
Below the flare, you hear Myrddin scream 'HEAR ME, FOR I HAVE CONQUERED!'
As the light fades you realize a new superhero has been born.
For the next 15 minutes experience is doubled in honor of the new superhero.

cast it if I'm already in combat, but I can't append a mob to attack after the alias... anyone know 
if there's something I need to add special to the alias to be able to append the mob name after the 
alias for it to work?

A mage einheriar arrives from below.

[Newbie] (Helper) Epsilon: Yes, there's an alias system in-game.

[Newbie] (Helper) Epsilon: If it's a MUSH alias, it's a bit more fiddly to get it to take a target.

[Newbie] Luathas: It askes what I wanna cast it on, lol. And when I'm in combat, it casts it on
whatever I'm fighting.

[Newbie] (Helper) Epsilon: Right, that's what it's doing.

help alias
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Alias.
Help Category : Utility.
Related Helps : WWW, Client Parsing.
Last Updated  : 2017-06-19 20:05:13.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:

    Alias <one-word string> <command>  : Create an alias.
    Alias                              : List current aliases.
    Unalias <alias name>               : Remove an alias.


Summary:

Type 'alias' to get a list of all your aliases.
Type 'alias <one-word string> <command>' to create a shortcut to a more
    lengthy or complex command.
Type 'unalias <alias name>' to delete an alias.
Type an alias name to use it.


Detail:

An alias is a user-created shortcut to replace lengthy, repeated commands 
by a single word/string, in much the same fashion as most MUD clients do.  

For example, if you 'alias eastgate run 2s7e', then any time you type
'eastgate', you would run 2s7e from your current location.  

Alias names can be up to 20 characters.  You can have up to 60 aliases.
You can see all your current aliases by typing 'alias' by itself.  Using
'unalias <alias name>' will delete an alias you no longer want.  If you simply
want to replace an alias, just alias it again and the new command will
overwrite the old alias.

An alias can contain multiple commands separated by a semicolon. There are
some limitations to aliases containing multiple commands:

- Each command within the alias will be executed only as a MUD command, you
  cannot have an alias with multiple commands calling other aliases.

- Any arguments after the alias when it's used will be ignored.

- If 'runto' is used, it must be the first command in the alias or it will
  be executed out of order.

There is also a video which shows alias help on Aardwolf:

help recall
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : RECALL.
Help Category : Transport.
Related Helps : Autorecall, Home, Word of Recall.
Last Updated  : 2017-09-01 09:21:32.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:  recall

'Recall' prays to your clan god or Ayla for miraculous transportation to
bring you back to Aylor.  '/' is a synonym for recall (though it may be 
interpreted by a MUD client as something different).

Using 'recall' outside of combat is automatically successful provided you
are not in a number of rooms which leave you forsaken.  Using recall while
engaged in combat has a chance of failure (based upon your skill, but even
at 100%, may still fail), and costs you more experience points than just
fleeing the room.

Using recall costs half your current movement points up to a maximum of
5000 moves. If you are a member of a clan, recall will take you back to your 
clan's recall point rather than to Aylor.

Last Updated  : 2017-09-01 10:33:55.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax: cast 'word of recall'
Spell Number: 82

Similar to the standard recall skill (see 'help recall'), this spell will
transport you back to Aylor or your clan recall provided you are not cursed
or in no-recall rooms.  Unlike recall, there is no move penalty, and using
the spell to escape combat does not cause any experience loss.
