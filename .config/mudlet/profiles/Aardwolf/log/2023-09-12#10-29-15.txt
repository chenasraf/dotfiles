You wake and stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

<MAPEND>

     A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.

Someone falls asleep.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The hot desert sands
  You stand on the scorching sands of the great desert.  To the south the
endless wastes stretch out to eternity.  To the north rises a large stone
structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north
towards the temple.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

  This small stand is surrounded by an average sized fence, which has
only three openings to let customers into the shop.  The small fence
contains a vast number of cauldrons boiling and bubbling with liquids of
reds, blues, magentas, and greens.  Many signs sit everywhere, saying,
"Do not touch!",  "Leave it alone!",  and "Hands to Yourself!".
A small, old gnome stands on a step stool, busily pouring a bubbling gel
into a small flask.

A plump dwarf, Radnir, walks past slowly, admiring the views.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.

structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north
towards the temple.

Entrance
  You stand in the shade of the temple entrance.  To the south the sun
blazes relentlessly onto the desert sand.  To the north lies the dark and
forbidding entrance to the temple.  From deep within the deserted catacombs
blows a slight breeze, as though the temple were breathing.  The air wafting
from the entrance smells of centuries of decay.  You wonder which is worse,
the hot blazing sun, or the stench of decay coming from within the
synagogue?

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

  You stand on the scorching sands of the great desert.  To the south the
endless wastes stretch out to eternity.  To the north rises a large stone
structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north
towards the temple.

huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

Road of Shadows
  You are walking down the Road of Shadows.  The whole length of this
street is dark, as if you are walking in a huge shadow.  Every now and then
a scream pierces through the darkness.  Glowing orbs float above your
head, but they don't seem to shed much light and they flicker on and off. 
 
The Road of Shadows continues east and west.  South stands a shadowy door.

Syntax: Mutare <item> <double|half>
 
Boot Camp has the knowledge to take something within their possession and
modify the item's weight by making it twice as heavy or reducing the weight
by half. Unfortunately, due to the special materials that are used when
increasing or decreasing the weight of an item, this can only be done once
per item and cannot be used on containers.

INFO: When the clan skill is used, the person will be automatically charged 
a total of 3 gold multiplied by the level of the item being modified. How 
often the clan skill works is based on your clan rank and your level 
compared to the level of the item you are trying to mutare. The clan skill 
will also add an ownership flag to the item it is used on, if one is not 
already present. Mutare can be used on items owned by your spouse and 
ownership will not be changed.

you.  Constructed entirely out of stone, the building is massive, easily
rivaling the castle's size.  From inside, you can hear the clashing of
swords, yelling, and screams of pain.  Is this where the elven soldiers

An Old Town Road
  At first glance, the road in this part of the town seems to not have any
sort of buildings to lead you to.  You can just make out a path used by the
wood elves to the west and east of the road.  The forest stays undisturbed
as the elves pass; it seems to bend to make the way easier for its partners.
As you peer down each path large buildings become visible, and many elves
can be seen entering and leaving.

  Despite the castle's severe age the drawbridge seems to be in perfect

Advisors' Table
  The advisors' room is dominated by a twenty foot long red oak table. 
Several elves walk around quickly here, bringing out maps and ancient battle
strategies to figure out how to route the orc invaders that will be on their
doorstep in a few short hours.  Bears, flaming arrows, and burning oil are
all being contemplated by the one elf who isn't running back and forth: The
King.  He slowly stands, his head bowed low in thought, and chooses to have
the mages begin the incantations to summon the wild animals of the forest to
their aid.  Perhaps nature, which broke this castle, can break a few orcs?

Peryana, the Master Mage is telling the King that the forest wants to help.
Yarrol stands here, trying to convince the King to rely on his own men.

You can only acquire a pet by using magic, a skill, or adopting low-level 
pets at the various pet stores around Andolor.  Pets will follow you and 
assist you when you fight. You may only have one pet at a time.

The 'PETS' command will show you which pets you have, and where they are.

To buy a pet in a pet shop, type 'list' to view the list of pets and then:
 
    adopt <keyword>        : Adopt a pet, using its default name.
    adopt <keyword> <name> : Adopt a pet, using a new name for it.

Note that pets are not allowed in most parts of Aylor, and that it is
usually not a good idea to bring a pet when you are on a quest.

Pets can do many things players can do.  Simply use 'order <pet> <command>'
to order a pet to do something.  Note that not all commands work with pets.

Pets can wear equipment, but only up to half their level and they cannot 
wear clan equipment. Just give the equipment to them, and order them to
wear it.  Beware! It is not recommended to give them equipment you care
about losing. If your pet lands a killing blow, the gold looted from the
mob will be lost.

To make a pet stop following you, type 'nofollow <name of pet>'.  To make
a pet stay where it is, order it to sleep/sit.  To make a pet return to 
you, use 'heel'. (This will not work in 'prison' flagged rooms.)

Pets only stay with you while you are in the game and will disappear when 
you quit.

prefix the social with * to use the social.  See 'help socials'.

Syntax: order <character> <command>
        order all <command>

'order' requests one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

Charmed creatures engaging in combat will break the charm.

A Collapsed Throne Room
  A large hole has been torn out of the roofing of the throne room. 
However through luck or elven woodland magic, an entire tree has tilted and
grown directly into the hole to restore the castle's defenses.  The living
roof is covered with leaves, drawing their light from the torches that line
the walls here.  To the back of the room two large thrones of human design
sit.  This must have been a long abandoned (or conquered) castle.

  Despite the castle being in severe disarray the reinforced entranceway to

have left the stone bearing cracks and chips.  Two heavily guarded elven
soldiers stand by the door, preventing those who would harm the king access
to the room.  Large redwood doors stand as a final defense of the throne

mechanism.  The drawbridge rises a few feet off the ground then returns.  It

weaving as he does so.  He continues to the east, slamming into the bar's

  At first glance, the road in this part of the town seems to not have any
sort of buildings to lead you to.  You can just make out a path used by the
wood elves to the west and east of the road.  The forest stays undisturbed
as the elves pass; it seems to bend to make the way easier for its partners.
As you peer down each path large buildings become visible, and many elves
can be seen entering and leaving.

swords, yelling, and screams of pain.  Is this where the elven soldiers

own bunk and foot locker to store personal items.  To the side of each bed

families.  Most of these soldiers have been called from other towns and have

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

On the outskirts of a battlefield
  Stepping through a small opening in the woodline, you find yourself
standing on the outer edge of what looks like a huge battlefield.  Your
mouth drops and you stare at the scene before you.  Chairs, tables, brooms,
and various other household items are fighting against animals!  How can
this be, though?  Furniture does not move and it certainly does not fight,
and even stranger is that the animals seem to be working together and using
makeshift weapons!

  This room is huge.  It is equal in size to the entire level of the tower

banquet hall.  Richard is here running about the room, enchanting more
animals.  Two birds fly in carrying another bird and drop it in a cage
before taking off again.  Within minutes Richard has revived it, ensorcelled
it somehow, and is dictating to it its new duties.  Seemingly happy about
the new job, the little bird flies past you and down the stairs.  You can
make out a small trapdoor leading up to the top of the tower in the far

The top of the tower
  Climbing up through the trapdoor, you find yourself standing on top of
the tower.  The wind is strong here and you become petrified with fear when
you realize there are no sides around the top of the tower.  It's just a
plain, flat top.  Suddenly a gust of wind blows you over and you cannot keep
your footing and go flying towards the edge of the tower!  Oh no, you will
fall to your death!  But wait, what's this?  You have landed in the air, as
if you are resting on a glass walkway.  Below you, you can see the
battlefield.  Shaken, your nerves shattered, you stand and cautiously test
the path east a bit more.  Seems sturdy enough so far....

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A long corridor
  You stand in a long dark corridor.  Dust and sand lie in drifts on the
floor, blown in by the desert wind.  Your footsteps echo hollowly from the
dark stone walls, or is there someone following you?  No, it's just an echo. 
The corridor continues north and south.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The hot desert sands
  You stand on the scorching sands of the great desert.  To the south the
endless wastes stretch out to eternity.  To the north rises a large stone
structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north
towards the temple.

Entrance
  You stand in the shade of the temple entrance.  To the south the sun
blazes relentlessly onto the desert sand.  To the north lies the dark and
forbidding entrance to the temple.  From deep within the deserted catacombs
blows a slight breeze, as though the temple were breathing.  The air wafting
from the entrance smells of centuries of decay.  You wonder which is worse,
the hot blazing sun, or the stench of decay coming from within the
synagogue?

Syntax: group                 : Shows group stats (if in a group).
        group <character>     : Add a character to a group.
        group accept <leader> : Accept a group invite from <leader>
        group <option>        : See below for a list of more group options.
        

Grouping allows players within 15 levels of each other to join together to
share experience and rewards. Players in a group can usually take advantage
of each other's special abilities to kill faster and/or hunt larger targets
than they can handle solo. It can also just simply be more fun to hunt in a
group. 

Aardwolf allows you to create a group, flag the group as public or 
private, invite other players to join, reassign group leadership and 
track experience and kills over a period of time. 

Basic Grouping
==============

The basic version of grouping simply requires you to follow someone.
If they 'group' you, you will be added to their group. If they don't 
already have a group, one will be created. Once this has been done,
all of the options below are available.


Enhanced Grouping
==================

The 'group' command has multiple options based on whether or not you are
already in a group, and your status within the group:

Global Group Commands
---------------------

Group Create <Groupname> : Allows you to create a new group that you
  can then invite other players to join. 

Group Create <Groupname> private : Adding the 'private' option will 
  make your group invisible to others.

Group List: List all publicly visible groups and their level range.
  Using 'group list stats' shows the list with kills/exp values.

Group Rank [option]: Sorts the list of public groups in order of
  kills (option 1) or total exp (option 2)

Group Accept <Leader>: Accept a group invite from the given group leader.

Group Decline <Leader>: Decline a group invite from given group leader.

Group Invites: See any outstanding group invitations you have.


Group Member Commands
---------------------

Group Leave: Leave the group. If the person leaving is a group leader,
  a new leader will be automatically assigned. If the person leaving 
  is the last player in the group, the group will be disbanded.

Group Stats: Show the kills and total experience for each group member.
  Only kills occuring in the room with the group leader will update stats.

Group Stats Resetme: Reset your stats in this group.


Group Leader Commands
----------------------

Group Invite <Player>: Invite other players into the group.

Group Invited: View outstanding invitations for this group.

Group Cancel <Player>: Cancel an invitation previously made to a 
  player.

Group Kick <Player>: Kick a person out of the group.

Group Leader <Player>: Assign leadership to another group member.

Group Disband: Disband the group completely.

Group Stats Reset: Reset the group stats (group header stats only).

Group Rename: Rename the group to something else.

Group Flag [Public/Private]: Flag the group public or private. The
  default setting for groups that consist of more than one player is 
  public. Public groups that have more than one member can be seen by
  anyone in 'group list'. Private groups can only be seen by members 
  and people who have been invited to join the group.


Group Related Commands
----------------------

Other commands that are important while in a group are:

Gtell: Talk to other group members on the group channel. The semicolon
  is a shortcut for grouptell. 'Gtell -h' shows group history.

Share <amount>: Split <amount> of gold equally between group members.
  See also the 'autoshare' config option.

Autoassist: Toggles whether or not you will automatically join combat
  to assist your group leader.

Group Related Notes
-------------------

* A 'kill' is only counted when the group leader is in the room - 
  this is intentional. A kill is also only counted when it gives 
  experience - charging through newbie areas to rack up kill counts will
  not work.

* Following yourself no longer removes you from a group - use 'group
  leave' to leave a group completely.

* 'Nofollow' prevents people from directly following you - it does
  not stop someone from automatically following you if you add them to
  your group - presumably when you do this you *want* them to follow
  you. Nofollow is intended to prevent random followers.

* Cursing is prohibited in the group name if it is a public group.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

The hot desert sands
  You stand on the scorching sands of the great desert.  To the south the
endless wastes stretch out to eternity.  To the north rises a large stone
structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north
towards the temple.

Entrance
  You stand in the shade of the temple entrance.  To the south the sun
blazes relentlessly onto the desert sand.  To the north lies the dark and
forbidding entrance to the temple.  From deep within the deserted catacombs
blows a slight breeze, as though the temple were breathing.  The air wafting
from the entrance smells of centuries of decay.  You wonder which is worse,
the hot blazing sun, or the stench of decay coming from within the
synagogue?

endless wastes stretch out to eternity.  To the north rises a large stone
structure, made from huge blocks of dark stone.  By the wind worn gargoyles
and other gruesome decor, you assume that this is the ancient temple of some
dark cult.  You can head south into the desert, or make your way north

Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a

  An asteroid field stretches almost as far as the eye can see across this

which place, poorly lit by the light of nearby stars, while dust forms a
haze around the larger asteroids, which look like floating mountains.  One
must be careful not to be crushed between them as they roll around and
bounce off of each other.  One of the asteroids here looks rather like a
spearhead.

Fantasizing
  Closing your eyes, you feel yourself being transported into a new world,
one of fantasies both good and bad.  The Fantasy Fields stretch in many
directions, encompassing visions of delight and horror.  Where you stand,
the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

before taking off again.  Within minutes Richard has revived it, ensorcelled
it somehow, and is dictating to it its new duties.  Seemingly happy about

your footing and go flying towards the edge of the tower!  Oh no, you will
fall to your death!  But wait, what's this?  You have landed in the air, as
if you are resting on a glass walkway.  Below you, you can see the
battlefield.  Shaken, your nerves shattered, you stand and cautiously test
the path east a bit more.  Seems sturdy enough so far....

The angel, Felicity looks down at you as you speak. She smiles.
The angel, Felicity exclaims, "Do whatever it takes to stop this war and
 save the land! This war has raged on since the king died years ago. Now,
 his two sons have been unable to decide who should rule. Rather than
 seeking a peaceful means to decide, Richard went on the offensive! His
 brother Virgil, however, has not been an easy target for the chaos Richard
 has unleashed!"
The angel, Felicity says, "This land is torn apart by a dark and twisted
 magic wielded by a demon! His dark and chaotic power is wrapped tightly
 over Richard's heart. Find Virgil, and he will ask a question of you."
The angel, Felicity says, "Save this land, KumoGami."
The angel, Felicity returns her gaze to the lands below.

  Climbing up through the trapdoor, you find yourself standing on top of
the tower.  The wind is strong here and you become petrified with fear when
you realize there are no sides around the top of the tower.  It's just a
plain, flat top.  Suddenly a gust of wind blows you over and you cannot keep
your footing and go flying towards the edge of the tower!  Oh no, you will
fall to your death!  But wait, what's this?  You have landed in the air, as
if you are resting on a glass walkway.  Below you, you can see the
battlefield.  Shaken, your nerves shattered, you stand and cautiously test
the path west a bit more.  Seems sturdy enough so far....

The black monolith
  A huge, jet black stone rises into the air here.  Standing at least
fifteen feet tall, it emanates a raw power that makes you shudder as it
courses through your body.  You fall to your knees, overcome with weakness
and fear.  Loathing fills your heart, and you suddenly wish to destroy every
last animal you see.  A huge figure straight from the tales of legend and
horror steps out before you.  Shaped like a man, this mottled grey creature
has rows of pointy teeth and is covered in sharp barbs.  The tips glisten
with a moisture and it grins an evil grin at you.  If you do not want to
fall victim to this demon's power, you had better act fast.  You can feel
your will slipping even now.

  Climbing up through the trapdoor, you find yourself standing on top of
the tower.  The wind is strong here and you become petrified with fear when
you realize there are no sides around the top of the tower.  It's just a
plain, flat top.  Suddenly a gust of wind blows you over and you cannot keep
your footing and go flying towards the edge of the tower!  Oh no, you will
fall to your death!  But wait, what's this?  You have landed in the air, as
if you are resting on a glass walkway.  Below you, you can see the
battlefield.  Shaken, your nerves shattered, you stand and cautiously test
the path east a bit more.  Seems sturdy enough so far....

this be, though?  Furniture does not move and it certainly does not fight,
and even stranger is that the animals seem to be working together and using
makeshift weapons!

The angel, Felicity says, "Do whatever it takes to stop this war and save the
land! This war has raged on since the king died years ago. Now, his two sons 
have been unable to decide who should rule. Rather than seeking a peaceful 
means to decide, Richard went on the offensive! His brother Virgil however, 
has not been an easy target for the chaos Richard has unleashed." 

Task 5  : Find the Preservation Stone!

Richard exclaims, "I told Virgil that powerless rock was stolen! It wasn't!
I threw it in a boot!" Richard asks, "Or was it a bucket?" Richard exclaims, 
"Bah! It could be anywhere!"

  The ground here is completely torn up.  Whatever happened must have been
a very destructive force to move this amount of earth, probably caused by
magic from one of the wizards.  You can plainly see a laid stone foundation
under the dirt here, and it appears to extend off in all directions under
the dirt.  Maybe this whole area used to be some other building.  You will
have to ponder this strange stone floor later, however; right now you need

  A great howling fills the air, and every animal and object alike in this
vicinity immediately stops what they are doing and looks far to the east.  A
tiny figure atop the tower holds a small glowing ball of energy.  Hurling it
towards the center of the battlefield, he makes it grow in size as it
approaches.  As the enormous ball of energy slams into the masses of those
fighting, wild shrieks and chatters rise into a roar, as both animals and
objects are frozen solid and shattered at the same time by the intense cold.

  A loud crackling noise grabs your attention and you quickly look upwards
to the top of the nearby tower.  A lone figure stands there, arms raised to
the clouds.  Swirling about, the clouds quickly gather in a large mass and
small jolts of lightning begin to fly out of it in various directions. 
Suddenly, with a loud shout, the figure throws his arms down towards the
ground and a huge lightning bolt cracks through the sky, slamming into the
central sections of the battlefield, roasting many of the animated objects. 
Even from here the electricity makes your hair stand on end.

is apparently a makeshift jail.  It is filled with tables, chairs, and other

  Emerging from the collapsing hallways, you wipe your forehead and release
a sigh of relief.  This place is as bad as Virgil's.  Both towers are on the
verge of collapse after so many months of constant battle.  You notice some
stairs here that seem to go both up and down, as well as collapsing hallways
leading off in all directions.  Unsure of which way to go, you place your
hand on the railing of the stairs and immediately draw it back.  Bird poop
covers this place, along with droppings of every other kind of animal that
has been in the immediate vicinity.

  Finally you have made it to Richard's tower.  You were worried traveling
through the battlefield with so much fighting raging on around you, but
neither the animals nor the enchanted goods seemed interested in you. 
Stepping just inside of the tower, you can see that this tower used to
actually be part of a castle.  Now, however, it is only shambled remains of
its former glory.  The floors and walls are covered in animal feces and
cracks run the length of the room, worrying you that at any time this whole
place may come down on top of you.

majestic.  Now, however, it is only an eyesore in ruins.

  The ground here is completely torn up.  Whatever happened must have been
a very destructive force to move this amount of earth, probably caused by
magic from one of the wizards.  You can plainly see a laid stone foundation
under the dirt here, and it appears to extend off in all directions under
the dirt.  Maybe this whole area used to be some other building.  You will
have to ponder this strange stone floor later, however; right now you need
to avoid being injured by the nearby combatants.

The top of the tower
  Climbing up through the trapdoor, you find yourself standing on top of
the tower.  The wind is strong here and you become petrified with fear when
you realize there are no sides around the top of the tower.  It's just a
plain, flat top.  Suddenly a gust of wind blows you over and you cannot keep
your footing and go flying towards the edge of the tower!  Oh no, you will
fall to your death!  But wait, what's this?  You have landed in the air, as
if you are resting on a glass walkway.  Below you, you can see the
battlefield.  Shaken, your nerves shattered, you stand and cautiously test
the path east a bit more.  Seems sturdy enough so far....

Richard's room
  This room is huge.  It is equal in size to the entire level of the tower
below this.  Apparently this room used to be some kind of ballroom or
banquet hall.  Richard is here running about the room, enchanting more
animals.  Two birds fly in carrying another bird and drop it in a cage
before taking off again.  Within minutes Richard has revived it, ensorcelled
it somehow, and is dictating to it its new duties.  Seemingly happy about
the new job, the little bird flies past you and down the stairs.  You can
make out a small trapdoor leading up to the top of the tower in the far

leading off in all directions.  Unsure of which way to go, you place your

actually be part of a castle.  Now, however, it is only shambled remains of

your footing and go flying towards the edge of the tower!  Oh no, you will
fall to your death!  But wait, what's this?  You have landed in the air, as

The top of the tower
  Climbing up through the trapdoor, you find yourself standing on top of

you realize there are no sides around the top of the tower.  It's just a
plain, flat top.  Suddenly a gust of wind blows you over and you cannot keep
your footing and go flying towards the edge of the tower!  Oh no, you will
fall to your death!  But wait, what's this?  You have landed in the air, as
if you are resting on a glass walkway.  Below you, you can see the
battlefield.  Shaken, your nerves shattered, you stand and cautiously test
the path east a bit more.  Seems sturdy enough so far....

  A huge, jet black stone rises into the air here.  Standing at least

courses through your body.  You fall to your knees, overcome with weakness
and fear.  Loathing fills your heart, and you suddenly wish to destroy every
last animal you see.  A huge figure straight from the tales of legend and
horror steps out before you.  Shaped like a man, this mottled grey creature
has rows of pointy teeth and is covered in sharp barbs.  The tips glisten
with a moisture and it grins an evil grin at you.  If you do not want to
fall victim to this demon's power, you had better act fast.  You can feel

Into the dark (G)
  You have entered a room of nothingness; there is no sound, no breeze, no
sign of life whatsoever, just a large dark hole.  This hole is said to lead
to a world of eternal darkness that is sure to drive you mad if you wander
through it for too long.

Walk of the Stars - Vespera
  Crimson light, like the ruddy hue of an unseen sunset, winds around these
stars.  And yet, unlike the Zenith trail, it does not seem malevolent, but
restful.  The path it takes runs from Kitalpha, past the moongate, then
north, parallel to Moonwalk until it reaches Kursa, and goes around Sham and
Tseen Kee on its way to Okda, and finally south to complete the loop.  Tseen
Kee, Sham and Kursa form a triangle to the northwest, while Saiph is off in
the southeast.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Fantasizing
  Closing your eyes, you feel yourself being transported into a new world,
one of fantasies both good and bad.  The Fantasy Fields stretch in many
directions, encompassing visions of delight and horror.  Where you stand,
the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

  Alas, it seems the strangeness of this world is too much for your mind to
handle.  Tearing your attention away from the realm of fantasy to open your
eyes partially, you see the world called 'reality' around you.  It is your
choice to wake up and allow that world to take over or to close your eyes
and enter Fantasy once again.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  Stepping through a small opening in the woodline, you find yourself
standing on the outer edge of what looks like a huge battlefield.  Your
mouth drops and you stare at the scene before you.  Chairs, tables, brooms,
and various other household items are fighting against animals!  How can
this be, though?  Furniture does not move and it certainly does not fight,
and even stranger is that the animals seem to be working together and using
makeshift weapons!

  A loud crackling noise grabs your attention and you quickly look upwards
to the top of the nearby tower.  A lone figure stands there, arms raised to
the clouds.  Swirling about, the clouds quickly gather in a large mass and
small jolts of lightning begin to fly out of it in various directions. 
Suddenly, with a loud shout, the figure throws his arms down towards the
ground and a huge lightning bolt cracks through the sky, slamming into the
central sections of the battlefield, roasting many of the animated objects.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

and eerie, your judgement tells you that it is not wise to proceed further.

You wake up on Medical beds, then stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

At the Mouth of a Cave (G)
  The path that you followed has led you to an uninviting cave.  It is dark
and eerie, your judgement tells you that it is not wise to proceed further. 
In the distance you hear the faint sounds of screams and swords slashing. 
Wondering what could be happening ahead you decide to continue into the cave
and explore.

Underground Valley
  The light at the end of the tunnel!!  You feel so relieved after being
cramped up in the caverns.  You must be getting closer to the Citadel.  From

down by fighting.  You step closer to the burning bushes and trees and
hear the sounds grow stronger.  You must be close to the battlefield!

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Whitewind Avenue (G) (818)

Entrance to the Crusader Clan Temple (G)
  It takes you only a few seconds to realise that this is no ordinary temple 
building. There is a constant flow in and out of the temple of people and 
goods. As you watch, a shipment of shining white plate armor is carted into 
the temple doors. Not long after, a group of noble knights exit the temple 
accompanied by the blare of trumpets to honor the start of a new crusade 
against evil. You notice a friendly knight standing near the large arch 
leading into the temple who appears to be directing all newcomers to various 
sections of the temple. You are convinced that your stay here will be a 
blessed one.

marble. Within the patterns of the opaque stone you glimpse images of past 
Crusaders. They seem to be speaking words of truth and wisdom to you. As you 
near the end of the hallway you wonder what strange power dwells in this 
place. Perhaps it is simply a figment of your imagination, brought on by the 
sacred aura that fills these corridors.

  As you step into the Temple Weaponry, you take notice of the remarkable items
displayed before you. The floor is worn and scuffed by the wear of time and 
the many travellers come and gone. Weapons of the finest quality have been 
set on display, while the Weaponry's caretaker Sir William is busy sharpening
another strong blade. Each item has been designed and honed to perfection.
The Crusaders take great care to ensure the quality and holy power of each 
weapon. Sir William pauses in his work and looks over to you with a 
half-hearted smile, then beckons you to look closer at each selection.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

The Reception Hall
  You gaze in amazement at what used to be an ornate hotel.  A chandelier
creaks alarmingly overhead.  To the west is a large dark room.  To the east
is a closed door with a sign.  Behind a pink and grey marble counter, a
skeleton slumps against the wall, seeming to want to talk to you.  Straight
ahead to the north is a long hall; you can't quite see to the end of it.

Rotunda
  This room has eight sides, with three of them stained glass.  At least
you think it is stained glass until you notice that the stain seems to be
blood.  Through double glass doors to the west you see a garden type area. 
By looking under some swinging half doors to the east, it looks like a
restaurant.  A wide banister made of mahogany with wide steps covered with
nearly threadbare carpet lead up into the darkness, spiraling so that you
can't see the top.  Straight ahead, the hallway continues.

Attic
  You've found an attic.  You hadn't realized how large the floor beneath
was.  The attic stretches in all directions, with irregular shapes and odd
nooks.  As well, there are all kinds of curious stuff and outright junk
scattered and piled everwhere.  To the north, you can make out a dirty
window, and there's a skylight above your head.  

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: up down ]
A transparent rat, trailing vapor, scuttles around the edges of the room.
A ghostly figure is here, leaning through the bar, holding a glass of something.
An albino cockroach flees from the light!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

You wake up on Medical beds, then stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Type 'quest list' at any questor to see the list of Aard items for sale. 
Don't sit at level 1 to save up quest points. Every time you remort you 
return to level 1, so just pick up however much eq you can afford as you 
run through the levels. The list below gives a skeleton of useful 
purchases. The level you buy at is EXTREMELY important.

Level 1
*Aura of Sanctuary
 Gloves of Dexterity
*Breastplate of Magic Resistance
 Bracers of Iron Grip
 Helm of True Sight
 Boots of Speed
 Wings
 Amulet
 Ring of Invisibility
 Ring of Regeneration

Level 100
 Breastplate of Magic Resistance
 Bracers
 Gloves

Level 150
 Breastplate of Magic Resistance

Level 200
 Breastplate of Magic Resistance
 Aura of Sanctuary
 Bracers
 Gloves

Level 251
 Breastplate of Magic Resistance
 Aura of Sanctuary (optimal time for stats - equivalent to a 291 aura)
 Bracers
 Gloves
 
*Possible items to prioritize

Weapons

High level mobs are tougher to kill so buy weapons first at the highest 
level, then move down the list until you eventually reach the lowest level
weapons. This makes leveling easier!
 
170 is probably the highest level weapon you will need. You might be 
considering a level 180 weapon, but keep in mind that as a newbie the 
bracers/gloves/breastplate will be more useful because at level 186 you can
ask on the wangrp channel for a drag ('help newbie-drag'). So the level
180 weapon is in fact only useful for 6 levels.
 
80 is usually the lowest level weapon you want to get because at that level 
there is a change to the average damage of quest weapons: avg Damage: 2.5 *
level if 1-79, 3 * level if 80 or higher.
 
Consider getting axes and daggers since their weight allows for dual 
wielding. 

However, make sure that you can use the weapon that you purchase. You
will often pick up the axe skill as you remort, if you don't start with it,
so you may want to purchase daggers first if you don't have the axe skill.

First get axes and dual wield with a weapon from a clan store:
 170 Axe of Aardwolf
 150 Axe of Aardwolf
 130 Axe of Aardwolf
 90  Axe of Aardwolf
 
Once you've gathered enough quest points fill in the gaps:
 160 Dagger of Aardwolf
 140 Dagger of Aardwolf
 120 Dagger of Aardwolf
 110 Axe of Aardwolf
 100 Dagger of Aardwolf
 
This way you can always dual wield two quest weapons:
 At 90: wield axe
 At 100: wield 90 level axe with dual 100 dagger
 At 110: wield 110 level axe with dual 100 dagger and so on. 
 
Eventually you may want to get weapons level 80 and below, but keep in mind
that clan weapons are 'good enough' in range 1-90.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

At the Mouth of a Cave (G)
  The path that you followed has led you to an uninviting cave.  It is dark
and eerie, your judgement tells you that it is not wise to proceed further. 
In the distance you hear the faint sounds of screams and swords slashing. 
Wondering what could be happening ahead you decide to continue into the cave
and explore.

Entrance to the Canyon Memorial Hospital
  Before you is a two story building made almost entirely of ice.  The cold 
wasteland surrounding it looks very forbidding.  A large sign in the center 
of the building proclaims Canyon Memorial Hospital.  Smaller signs are hung 
to the left and right of the large triple doors.  The door in the middle is 
much wider than the other two.

Surgical Waiting Room
  This large icy room is filled with chairs.  It appears that this room has
not been reorganized in some time.  A tiny group of chairs has been circled
together in one corner.  Newsprint and magazines were placed in a seemingly
random fashion amongst the chairs.  None seem to have been read, but rather
just used to keep track of time.  A large clock stands against the wall and
seems to show the current time.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

Before the Fabled City
  The City of Stone looms ahead of you.  The towering stone monuments of
the city contrast with the luscious green of your immediate surroundings.  It
appears majestic, the simple curves of the stone buildings reflect the
sunset slightly, creating an almost eerie feeling.  From this distance you
can't see any movement or life inside the city.  Wondering if the city will
be as quiet and serene inside its walls as it appears from here, you
continue on your journey.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

upon the attacker's war room, you decide that it is best to keep yourself
hidden and listen in on their plans.

A Small Clearing
  Stepping out of the bushes, you find yourself in a less dense part of the
forest.  Beams of light from the sky shine down creating leafy patterns over
the ground.  Animals roam peacefully, searching for food and enjoying the

occaisional sound of a muffled scream ahead makes you wonder if even these
tranquil surroundings are safe.

  Climbing down the old wooden ladder you enter a small cave-like room. 
There is a small bench with some old magazines and a low burning candle
sitting off to one side.  A door is set into the stone on the east wall, and
the steel grating opens up above.

and the bartender leans over waiting for your order.  A large sign, pinned
to the wall by a knife, awaits your inspection.

Moonlight Avenue
  You stand on Moonlight avenue, thinking the name is a cruel joke on
surface dwellers for you wish you could see the moon, not the continuous
darkness that lives in this city.  Everywhere darkness creeps, even with the
lights that adorn some of the streets, it is still dark. To your east lies the
entrance to a dark building and it seems to just disappear into the night.  The
door seems to be rusted shut.
 
North and south moonlight continues, east is the door.

  Moonlight Avenue is a really boring street.  Nothing of interest lies
anywhere in your view.  Of course, the dark prevents you from seeing far
anyways.  Little orbs of light float above your head.

Moonlight continues north and south.

Moonlight Avenue
  Moonlight Avenue is a boring street.  Nothing exciting happens here, you
wonder if it is the name.  The street is clean and well travelled.  You seem
oddly at ease on this street.  The shadows seem less dangerous here.  The
light of the floating orbs is unsure and insecure, they seem to flicker in and
out.
 
Moonlight Avenue goes north and south, to the east is Diamond Street.

a mountain, layers have been transformed into different shapes as it rises
upwards disappearing into the clouds.  The adventurer's spirit within you is
aroused.  Sounds of fighting filter up to greet you.  An urge to practice

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

     (Magic) A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     (Magic) Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.
