Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
CLAN: At-ten-tion! KumoGami is here to get some training done!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

| Good afternoon, Boot-
| 
| I will be stepping down as General in the near future, which means that you,
| yes YOU, have an opportunity to toss your name in the hat. Ever wondered what
| goes into clan management? Ever wish it was you picking out which
| goals/tasks/arbitrary assignments people perform for promotion? Ever want to
| really find out what gives Saraid a tic ... I mean what makes her tick?
| 
| If you are interested in the job, send a note to any Boot leader by noon game
| time on Sunday, Sept 3 (that's this coming Sunday). If you have any questions,
| don't hesitate to ask.
