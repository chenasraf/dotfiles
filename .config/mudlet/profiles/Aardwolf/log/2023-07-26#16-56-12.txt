Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
A Corridor in the Labyrinth
  
The labyrinth ends.
 
*blink*
 
Yep, this is the center of the maze. It's here that the Queen's magic is
strongest. The ground is bare rock without even a dusting of soil to
cushion footsteps, and every inch of the hedge walls are crowded with spiky
thorns. It's painfully bright here, enough to make one shade one's eyes,
though the source of the light is a mystery. In the very center of this
denuded patch of stone, a tall stake has been thrust deep into the ground.
Around it grows a special breed of deathberry bush, in the form of climbing
ivy that's a lot tougher than it looks. It also grows around the victim
chained to the pole, inflicting just enough poison to torture the poor man.

[ Exits: north ]
     A book bound in blood-dyed leather rests here.
A half-orc maiden gives you a shy, fanged smile.
(White Aura) The poor farmboy Yelsem is chained to the deadly deathberry bushes.

Syntax: description 
        description edit

Typing 'description' will show your current description if you have one. 

Descriptions are seen when looking at a player, as well as in 'whois' (if
the 'autodesc' toggle is turned on) or with the 'showdesc' command.  To
help prevent trigger abuse, descriptions will show with a pipe in front of
them unless turned off via the 'noprefix' config toggle.

To change your description, use 'desc edit'.  This will place you in the
description editor, similar to the note editor, where you can change your
description.  Type .h in the editor to get a list of commands available.
(zMUD users, see below.)

The editor may not be used in the warzone or lasertag area or in PK or
combat maze rooms.


zMUD users:  By default, zMUD interprets . at the beginning of a line as an
internal zMUD command.  To use .commands in the description editor, either
prefix the command with a tilde (~.h, etc.) or turn off parsing either with
ctrl-R or clicking the computer icon to the right of the input line).  
Other clients may have a similar issue; check your command prefixes for a
'literal character' to prefix the .command .

A Corridor in the Labyrinth
  
The labyrinth ends.
 
*blink*
 
Yep, this is the center of the maze. It's here that the Queen's magic is
strongest. The ground is bare rock without even a dusting of soil to
cushion footsteps, and every inch of the hedge walls are crowded with spiky
thorns. It's painfully bright here, enough to make one shade one's eyes,
though the source of the light is a mystery. In the very center of this
denuded patch of stone, a tall stake has been thrust deep into the ground.
Around it grows a special breed of deathberry bush, in the form of climbing
ivy that's a lot tougher than it looks. It also grows around the victim
chained to the pole, inflicting just enough poison to torture the poor man.

[ Exits: north ]
     (Magic) A book bound in blood-dyed leather rests here.
An assassin skulks through the labyrinth, sulking about their fate.
(White Aura) The poor farmboy Yelsem is chained to the deadly deathberry bushes.

A Dome in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  This is, in fact, the largest part of the maze.
Instead of a long corridor, though, the hedges form a sqarish, domed chamber
easily twice the width of any other passageway in the labyrinth.  The soft
grass has been trampled flat, testament to the high number of creatures that
pass through here every day.  Or is it night?  In any case, four large
archways, to the north, east, south and west, lead further into the maze.  

[ Exits: north east south west ]
A half-orc maiden gives you a shy, fanged smile.
A white-skinned mephit melts through the air.

A Dead End in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth suddenly ends again, forming a quiet little cul-de-sac.  A
community of dog-like creatures have set up their home here.  Grass from
other parts of the maze has been gathered and painstakingly woven into
little round beds and a fallen log partially blocks off this section from
the rest of the maze.  You can still head back to the west if you wish,
though.
