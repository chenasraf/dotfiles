Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Also called the Archivist's Star, it is thought that an ancient library
from ages past was relocated here during the Cataclysm.  Though now safe
from the Demonlord's rampage, it is unknown whether it will ever be
reopened.  Because of the danger, the spells protecting the archive make it
so that it can only be opened from the inside.  Given that the Cataclysm is
long over, many fear that all inside it have simply perished, and that it
will be lost forever.  And yet, others hope that they are merely being
overly cautious, pointing out that some could have survived, as it were, by
becoming undead.

  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

A seedy port
  You step off the dilapidated dock into an even more dilapidated
waterfront.  This is the ugliest port town you have ever seen.  The
buildings all seem in imminent danger of collapsing, and even the busiest
street is cluttered with garbage.  Big rats wander the streets, chasing cats
and driving pedestrians up onto the few boards that serve as a sidewalk.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  A sudden barrage of flying sand grains makes it hard to see which way

let alone finding a way forward.  Staying, though, would mean a change in
career from adventurer to sculpture.  Better find a way out of this storm
fast.

almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be

none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a

A Secluded Harem
  This set of rooms is large and open, with arched ceilings and painted stone 
walls. The paint is fading and flaking, and small piles of sand lay about the
room. Benches line the walls, with big fluffy pillows and cushions made of 
fading silks and satins. Alcoves open to the west and south, with the faded 
remains of mesh curtains hanging as barriers to add privacy to the area.

Ornate planters line the walls, filled now with piles of sand instead of lush
greenery. An alcove to the south provides some privacy, while the large and

A Harem Alcove
  What was once a large window faces south here, the interior shutters holding 
fast against the heavy weight of sand outside. The window is set back quite a
ways into the wall, leaving room for a lounging area that is large enough to 
go past a window-seat into a window-bed. An empty birdcage hangs from the 
arched ceiling in front of the window, its door broken off and missing.
Soft, luxurious pillows line the ground and the lounging area, the colorful 
silks having faded with time.

  Slightly raised from the rest of the harem, this platform can easily be 
viewed by anyone resting in the open areas of the harem. Delicate silks and 
transparent fabrics hang from the ceiling in locations on the dais, places 
where dancers could sway in and out of view. Colored glass on the ceiling 
would have once allowed rainbowed shafts of sunlight to add to the spectacle,
but now only sand lays above the skylights.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Southern Green (G) (726)

On a Path
  This small path appears to be made by animals that pass through during
the night.  The grass has been trampled in numerous spots while small rocks
and shrubs line up around the sides.  To the north lies the Eastern Forest
and you can make out a log cabin to the northeast.  The trail itself
continues on east while you can go west back to the southern edge of the
town green.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

occasionally dust can be seen drifting down from the ceiling.  The bar is
covered in old ale stains, and the stench is horrendous.  It smells more
like a latrine than a saloon.  The one good thing about this saloon is the
dainty fat man singing songs over in the corner.  At least you can listen to

Thimble's Kitchen
  Thimble is the only person allowed to cook in this kitchen.  She is very
protective of the dishes she prepares.  It has all the modern conveniences
of the time, and some from the past.  The stove has a magical blue flame
that automatically adjusts itself to whatever temperature the dish requires.
On the counter is a selection of very sharp knives that Thimble often uses,
and a pair of measuring cups sit on the floor.  Don't go down unless you are
looking for a beating.

The Shack Guard Post
  Are standing at a guard post before the peasant shack.  It's a normal
guard post, but it's not very well guarded.  On either side are two cells
that hold suspicious individuals.  All persons visiting the shack must pass
through inspection.  This is quite a bit of security for a simple shack.

A Dilapidated Peasant Shack
  You're standing before a dilapidated peasant shack.  The wooden boards
are crumbling and if you touched the walls you would probably get a
splinter.  The red door is hanging half off of its hinges and is unable to
be locked.  The only way this dump got to be the royal castle was because of
the changes the magic caused.

A Small Hermit's Glade
  You find yourself standing in the middle of a party in a small hermit's
glade.  Children dance and sing around you.  Some adults are having a picnic
under an ancient willow tree.  As if by magic, the blue sky above rains down
a light shower of glitter over the glade, making it shimmer and sparkle. 
Everyone seems happy here and the hermit is the center of attention.  Who
knew a hermit could have so many friends?

you can make out some buildings. Maybe you were closer to Dortmund than you 
thought. Word has it they have work for adventurers here. Hopefully that's

A Rock Fissure
  As you approach the massive rock base, a wide fissure becomes visible. 
From within, various sounds grow louder, sending a wave of excitement through
your veins.  Clashing of metal and muted voices seem to be just ahead.  What
is it?  A creature waiting to attack or an ally?  You summon your courage to
overcome your fear.  Grasping the chance to gain valuable experience at this
early stage of your journey, onward you go.

Syntax: rescue <target>

Amidst the fury of battle, you turn and find your comrade struggling under
the onslaught! Rather than allow them to be severely beaten, you jump between
your friend and their foe, rescuing them from further harm.

Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as well as a comparison of
level, dexterity, and speed between the character and the target. (Note- you
rescue a friend, not the monster.)

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

| I personally feel like any spell that DID restore a lot of moves would

| see much of a good argument against allowing movement potions to scale up
| to the degree healing potions can. If both healing potions and movement potions
| were roughly equal in the returned value I would suspect this would be
| enough of a revision.

The Common Square
  People pass by talking to each other, or rest their weary bones on this
grassy field.  You can hear faint sounds of the river to the south of you as
it passes through the city.  Ishtar drive heads east and west from here and
the medina is to the north.  South lies the Ishtar River bridge and the
southern gate.

  Loud hammering and the sound of red hot iron cooling in water reaches
your ears as you stand in front of the blacksmith.  A small boy runs up to
you with big eyes and as you return his gaze runs off down the road.  The

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

A Ferocious Sandstorm (G)
  A sudden barrage of flying sand grains makes it hard to see which way
to go next.  Just keeping a straight unblinking gaze is next to impossible,
let alone finding a way forward.  Staying, though, would mean a change in
career from adventurer to sculpture.  Better find a way out of this storm
fast.

Unforgiving Heat
  A high rocky outcropping provides a perfect wall blocking the stinging and 
grit of the recent desert sandstorm. Surprisingly, the air now is still, 
almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be
an understatement. A long tall glass of water would be welcome but there is 
none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a 
wish.
