The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

The Private Gardens
  You enter a cavernous chamber filled with plants, trees, and flowers of all 
descriptions. The air is heavy with humidity and you feel as though you have 
been struck with a web blanket. Several of the plants are covered with thick 
syrupy liquid, and they lean towards you as you walk past them. Some of these
plants may be more than just decorative for the uninvited.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  The road you have been walking on has become clouded up ahead. A thick 
choking fog has descended and envelops it and you as well. The air is 
choking heavy with the moisture and a sickeningly sweet smell. You can't

that the way back has become obscured. The only things you can make out 
clearly are the road under your feet and the soft glow of the light above
you...

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

  Ooh yes indeed, you should have known that only one person of this ship is 
mad enough to maintain a friendly talk with his enemies. Captain Prosper does
not succeed very much in his efforts however, because there is no sign that 
the Sea Witch invaders wish to leave the ship.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.

hum in your ears. Just off the shallow waters you see a group of ships, 
seamen tirelessly unloading supplies. Inland a short distance, you spot a 
makeshift camp positioned just before a towering forest. A dim rainbow arcs 
up in front of the camp like an entryway.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  You are standing in the middle of a vast field.  It would be a
run-of-the-mill field, except for the fact that there's a strange object of
immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to
be a flying ship.  What's even more interesting, is there is a rope ladder
which hangs down from the side of the ship.  It's the perfect invitation for
you to enter.

  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable

ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

weight is quite enormous.  Many men are required to lift the beast.  Other
than this one small imperfection , the ship is clean as clean could be.  It

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

and anything else you could imagine to see is here.  You are filled with awe

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  This silvery strand of starlight slithers through the sky, making very
many to wonder often why.  The ribbon of a road winds around this place, as
if it were created for some forgotten race.  Now it just shimmers, strewn
through the stars, guiding those who travel, near or far.  Phact is directly

  As you look around, you wonder if this is any better then the tunnels. 
The ground is twisted and broken, a plain filled with death.  Bones litter
the surface, hundreds of creatures must've died here.  The sky fills you
with unease as it casts an eerie array of colors around you.  You decide to
keep your eyes down since watching the clouds above you boil fills you with
nausea.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Twisted and Cracked Ancient Road
  Lone and bare, the level sands stretch and twist to the edges of
vision.  Like slow ocean breakers they crash against the rocky shores of
this desert sea.  Ancient bleached bones sit like shipwrecks high upon the
rocks that thrust through the sandy waves, beckoning like sirens of old
those weary travellers to their thirsty doom.  A cracked and ancient road
rides through the wastes like a bridge over a troubled sea, twisting on
motionless waves of sand until it disappears into the haze of the east.  
A small weather beaten and blasted marker sits half buried by the all
encompassing sands.  Its barely legible words state '20 miles to Reme.'

The edge of a steamy marsh (G)
  As you turn off the swampy path, you realize that the loggers back in Aylor 
were not as drunk as they should have been from all the Firebreather they had
been drinking. Clearly visible, now that the loggers have chopped through the
undergrowth and the trees, is the trail you followed to see for yourself if 
the wild stories the loggers were telling were spun out of firebreather, or 
if a real adventure could be here. You stand at the very edge of the steaming
wetland, hearing the small chitterings, buzzings and splashes that are 
associated with places such as this; however, there is also a very faint 
chanting on the breeze that doesn't belong here. As you look around, you 
notice that like any marshland or wetland, this one is full of greenery, 
though there is a multitude of colors from flowers, insects, and decay mixed 
with the trees. As you continue to look, you notice three paths branching 
from this point, going deeper into the marsh, and of course, the way back to 
the swampy path.

A muddy path
  The path you are following is a sign of things to come it would seem. 
The trees here are tall, their large roots poking through the brown mud that
serves as a path.  The sounds of insects and chittering animals begins to
surround you as you move deeper into the marsh, and the heat mixed with
water vapor makes the air shimmer.  There is a light breeze, but it is by no
means a cooling one.  Through the trees to the left and right you can barely
make out dark, shady-looking pools of water.  The sound of frogs and other
aquatic animals drift to your ears.  Still the chanting continues, you
remember the loggers mentioning the chanting as well, and they also
mentioned dangers; fierce tribal lizardmen, and something about large rats
and moving trees.  Ahead the path continues deeper into the steamy quagmire,
though you can still return to the edge of this untamed land and try another
path or simply leave before you find those lizardmen.

  The vegetation here has grown up over what little path there was in this
swamp.  Thick brown tree trunks block both east and west travel, and vines
with brightly colored flowers cover the path, along with several other
plants.  Moss grows all over everything here, and fungi of all sorts seem to
spring out of every crevice and crack in the bark of the trees and vines. 
It is extremely dark here, and the air is heavy with humidity and the scents
of flourishing undergrowth.  Ahead it looks as if this vegetation will
recede again and let in light.

  Here the undergrowth is less than to the south, the path slopes up
slightly, and the mud is a little drier than in the surrounding area.  From
here you can see a bit farther in all directions.  To the north, and
slightly east, you can see the sparkling of sunlight on water, though only
brief glimpses of the body of water through the many trees that surround it.
There appears to be some form of rock formation directly north, though it is
covered in moss and plant life.  To the west, you see some sort of thorny
plant with long spines, and it does not look possible to penetrate the
undergrowth in that direction, even if you did wish to risk your skin on
those spines.

  As you walk along this path, you notice faint signs of tracks.  Also
there are some discarded tools lying in the mud off to one side of the
trail.  It strikes you suddenly that this is the first time you can truly
call any cleared path in this marsh a trail.  There are still tall, thick
trees with vines and flowers growing around them, and the trail is still
dotted with shallow dips where water has collected, but it has been cleared
of most of the vegetation that thrives in the steamy climate.  To the east,
thick undergrowth and vines block any passage, except perhaps by the small
animals who call the marshlands home, while west will take you back to the
slight rise in the land.  North you can now plainly see the large lake,
though it is still a ways off.  The mound you first noticed on your way
along the path rises to the west and just to the north.  There is a faint
sound of rustling and hissing coming from farther to the north.

  From here you can see the lake more clearly than before.  Thick
vegetation is all around, but you notice that the trees on the lakeshore are
not growing quite so close together.  West from here the mound has an
opening, and appears to be a den of some sort.  The hissing and rustling you
heard is coming from inside the mound, and there are a lot of tracks leading
in and out of the opening.  There are still trees to the east and it appears
that one or two are dead, there are a couple of logs on the ground, covered
in fungi and moss which glows a soft green.  The scent of mud, decaying
vegetation and water fills your nostrils and the sounds of insects and small
animals fill your ears as you move along the path.

  Finally, you stand at the shore of a lake.  The water appears clean and
clear, and you can see birds out on the lake, diving and coming up with
silvery fish in their beaks.  The shore of the lake is covered with cattails
and small red and yellow flowers.  The mud here is very thick and you can
see prints which have sunk into the mud about five inches.  The air here is
very thick and humid, although the slight breeze off the water makes it feel
somewhat cooler than back on the path.  There is a large tree here, its
branches lower to the water than many you have seen in the marsh.  It
appears that the branches extend completely across the lake, overlapping
with branches from other trees.  There are splashes out on the water, and
you catch fleeting glimpses of bass and other fish leaping out to catch an
insect, before disappearing with barely a ripple on the surface of the lake.

Out on the lake
  The water in the lake is lukewarm.  It probably never drops to any
temperature that would be uncomfortable for the average human.  The water is
clear, and you can clearly see fish swimming in the waters.  Also birds dive
and swim in the water with you.  Looking up, you see the tangle of limbs
high above you, making a bridge over the lake.  Algae grows on the rocks
near the lakeshore and on the rocks at the bottom of the lake.  There are
many aquatic plants in the lake as well, hiding some of the depths from
view.

On the lake
  The waters here are crystal clear.  To the south, you see the far shore
and the tree, which is on the other end of the bridge.  The tree is much
like the one that grows on this side of the lake.  West is a thriving mass
of thick vegetation, and even here the insects which fly to and from the
reeds are a near constant cloud over the water.  Silver, black and brown
fish leap from the water to skillfully catch the insects, and a small frog
paddles by with its tongue flickering constantly as it devours more of the
insects.

On the lakeshore next to a great tree
  The lakeshore is fairly solid here, and the roots of an enormous tree
help to provide footing.  As you look around, you notice that the great tree
here stands almost alone, and is the tallest in this part of the marsh.  It
continues up high above the surrounding treetops, and its branches extend in
all directions.  Some of the southern branches extend far out over the lake,
and they seem to mingle with branches from another great tree on the other
side of the lake, creating a natural bridge across the lake.  You can
continue around the lake, or maybe take a swim in the inviting waters,
though you get the feeling that predators are always on the lookout for some
unwary thing in the deep waters.  You could also go over the bridge, if you
wish, or continue deeper into the marshlands to the north.

Steamy path
  After passing the great tree you come to a slight clearing in the
marshland.  Here the path is broad and the trees and undergrowth do not
intrude.  The mud steams and fills the air with misty clouds of vapor as the
mud bubbles, never seeming to dry at all.  The scent of stagnant water is
heavy and the oozing brown muck clings to everything it touches.  In the
distance, to the northwest, you can see the largest tree you have ever seen.
From here it is difficult to make out much detail, though its branches seem
to hang down like those of a weeping willow.  Also, you can finally
determine where the primal chanting is coming from.  It, too, is coming from
the northwest, and it would seem as if the tree shelters whatever, or
whoever is chanting.  A King Fisher glides overhead and a small squeaking
shriek comes from the undergrowth to the east, and you quickly glance around
for other paths.  It would appear that after crossing the lake you can only
go toward the large tree in the distance.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The edge of a steamy marsh (G)
  As you turn off the swampy path, you realize that the loggers back in Aylor 
were not as drunk as they should have been from all the Firebreather they had
been drinking. Clearly visible, now that the loggers have chopped through the
undergrowth and the trees, is the trail you followed to see for yourself if 
the wild stories the loggers were telling were spun out of firebreather, or 
if a real adventure could be here. You stand at the very edge of the steaming
wetland, hearing the small chitterings, buzzings and splashes that are 
associated with places such as this; however, there is also a very faint 
chanting on the breeze that doesn't belong here. As you look around, you 
notice that like any marshland or wetland, this one is full of greenery, 
though there is a multitude of colors from flowers, insects, and decay mixed 
with the trees. As you continue to look, you notice three paths branching 
from this point, going deeper into the marsh, and of course, the way back to 
the swampy path.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
A very large brown bear searches through the undergrowth for food.
A garter snake suns itself on a rock.
(Hidden) (Red Aura) A brutish Lizardman moves silently through the marsh.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

been drinking. Clearly visible, now that the loggers have chopped through the

the wild stories the loggers were telling were spun out of firebreather, or 
if a real adventure could be here. You stand at the very edge of the steaming
wetland, hearing the small chitterings, buzzings and splashes that are 
associated with places such as this; however, there is also a very faint 
chanting on the breeze that doesn't belong here. As you look around, you 
notice that like any marshland or wetland, this one is full of greenery, 
though there is a multitude of colors from flowers, insects, and decay mixed 
with the trees. As you continue to look, you notice three paths branching 
from this point, going deeper into the marsh, and of course, the way back to

A dark and gloomy path
  As you leave the sunlit clearing behind, you find yourself on a winding
path filled with tall trees, their trunks thick and their bark a greenish
brown and riddled with deep fissures.  High overhead, the branches of the
trees weave into a canopy which serves to block out the light.  Harsh calls
from some exotic birds, as well as soft whirrs and buzzings filter through
the thick undergrowth.  There are sounds of scrabbling and snuffling deep in
the undergrowth as well.  The ground here is muddy, but it seems drier than
the ground in the stump dotted clearing.  The air is very humid, and seems
to press down on you.  To the west is the clearing, while to the north, the
winding path continues to snake its way into the marshlands.

clinging to anything that touches it.  Deep prints show in the mud, from

branches far above.

  Here the path opens up a bit, and becomes broader.  The sun hammers down
on this spot as well, and you can see fallen trees to either side of the
path.  A few saplings reach toward the sky, but they are only a few feet
high at the moment.  Large, rotted logs litter the undergrowth, and farther
back in the undergrowth, where the larger trees again reclaim the land, you
can see glowing green fungus and moss spreading over the decaying
vegetation.  The path becomes very muddy here, and a small pool of stagnant
water to the east bubbles and steams.  Small reptiles and swarms of insects
move around the water and across the path.  A small rodent chitters and
scurries across the path, disappearing into the undergrowth.  The air
becomes heaver with water, and you can smell the sickeningly sweet smell of
decay and the slightly sharp odor of water and mud.

Dark winding path
  The trees grow thickly along this stretch of the winding path.  Ancient
sentinels guarding the secrets of the deeper and darker places in the marsh.
Thick bushes with thorns and bright flowers choke the sides of the path and
the sweet smell of nectar permeates the air.  Life, it seems, is everywhere,
the cycle shown in so many ways, rotting logs, fungi feeding on dead things
back in the dark.  The death screams of small rodents to some predator.  All
these things you can hear and sometimes even see while traveling through the
marshland.  The sounds, sights and smells are all of life, death and
rebirth.  You can hear more clearly, as well, a source of water, larger than
the small stagnant pools which form in the underbrush from the constant
dripping of water from the trees and vines.  An errant breeze lightly
brushes your cheek, and it brings with it the chanting you heard when first
entering the marshlands, and you again wonder what the source of that sound
could be as it tugs at something deep inside you; something primal and
almost forgotten, yet still very real and very much a part of your being.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  These rugged hills are little more than a gloomy and uneven undulation of
rock and ash.  The sky is purplish and an occasional comet spurts overhead. 
Your sense of foreboding grows.  What demonic forces lurk here?  The air
seems to have gotten a bit chilly, or is it just the desolate nature of this

There is a loud scream and a flare of light shoots towards the sky.
Below the flare, you hear Zathrus scream 'HEAR ME, FOR I HAVE CONQUERED!'
As the light fades you realize a new superhero has been born.
For the next 15 minutes experience is doubled in honor of the new superhero.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

A Hazy Dry Field
  The path through the garden disappears into a field of thorn bushes. 
Drops of poison glisten menacingly from the thorns.  The poison is so strong
that nothing else can grow in the field.  A pair of vultures circle lazily

Dark Tunnel
  You stand in a dark tunnel.   Your light source illuminates a cleanly cut
tunnel.  You seem to be standing where it ends. On the wall you see
scribbled in blood:

Progress only if thou canst not be seen or if thou art powerful. 

The air is dry but cold.  The floor is even without any marks of tools.  The
walls are straight without any indication that mining tools have carved this
tunnel, only to the north are there any marks at all. 

The tunnel plunges into darkness to the south.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

An old veteran stands behind the bar, ready to serve you a cool drink.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Voting Room (G)
  Here people come to vote. Even in the army, the most
undemoctratic thing in the world, people vote. Not 
all votes here are binding, but there is a time and
a place for everything.

Plastered on the walls are some reminders of what boot 
camp stands for:

Theme:
Boot Camp is, in essence, a clan made up of new players. Based
on the idea of helping the Helpershelper, this clan will take in new
players and let them learn until they decide to become teachers or
are ready to move on to bigger and better things.

Clan Decisions:
All decisions in the clan are made through voting by 
the Clan Leaders and rank 5 or 6 players. Although the 
clan will be primarily democratic, Clan Leaders or the 
Helpershelper have final say and can overrule any votes 
if they feel they go against the Clan's Petition, Theme,
Safety, or Harmony.

While the original clan petition and modified form 
remains on the Website under the watchful eye of
the Clan's Web handler, these two things remain
unchanged, at least until another vote is cast...

although it is clean and tidy with a comfortable looking chair resting

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A Dusty Road
  You step out from the light forest behind you and onto a dusty road. All 
before you the growth has stopped abruptly. Not only does it appear someone 
has clear-cut any sign of flora, but there is also a massive pit in the 
ground. It looks as if the pit has been cut straight down with only a narrow 
zigzagging path leading to its depths. Before the pit, however, is a small 
camp made up of roughshod tents and white stone buildings. It looks as if a 
decent wind would carry this camp away, over the cliff, and into the pit.
Every sound seems to echo off of the walls of the pit, making it impossible 
to determine their origin. Barking voices can be heard above the din of metal
on stone in the distance.

A Dusty Road
  The gravel crunches under your feet as you continue down the dirt road. The 
crushed rock is all of a consistent size, suggesting the rubble was created 
for this specific purpose. Farther up the road, the side of a white stone 
house can be seen to the west, sidled by three tattered tents. The tent 
farthest to the east is the largest, with a strange sign hanging outside of 
it. The remnants of a fence are the only thing separating the path north and 
the crossroads to the south. The barks from the south are starting to compete
with the clash of metal on stone within the pit.

  The noise here is unbearable. The screaming of stone being hewn by picks and 
hammers, the screech of metal carts against rusted rails, and the constant 
barking all combine into an intolerable cacophony. Tattered burlap tents open
to the south and east, each one emitting more barks. The tent to the east is 
quite a bit larger than the one to the south. A sign can be seen above the 
tent to the south. To the west leads a path down into the pit. You can also 
see the front door to the white building. Unlike the two closest tents, a 
third tent stands atop some rubble to the west. This tent is smaller than the
other two, but is much less tattered and has been erected strong enough to 
keep out any debris that may fly in with the breeze.

  As you get closer to the pit, the rumble of mining carts, hammers, and 
chisels overwhelms any other noise from the camp. Although less deafening 
than the barking of the gnolls, the sounds coming from the pit also comes 
with vibrations. The rubble path turns more solid as you approach the descent
into the pit to the west. Looking over the edge of the pit you can see the 
narrow path leading downward at a dizzying incline. The door to the stone 
building faces south, and has clearly been repaired multiple times. Barking 
comes from both north and south of the road. From each direction, the barking
sounds drastically different. The staccato barking from the tent to the south
is monotonous and abrupt, while the rhythmic barking from the north varies in
pitch and tone.

  This was the last standing building from whatever happened before the gnolls.
Based off of rubble piled up in the corner of this two-room building, it was 
once nicely furnished and lavishly decorated. All the remains are the shards 
of painted ceramics and shredded strips of fabric, presumably paintings. All 
that remains is the hearth in the middle of the room, a table near the north 
wall, and a ruined doorway to the west. Despite the rubble, the building is 
well maintained; any damage once sustained has been repaired using the bounty
from the quarry. There is a faint smell of bread baking, but none can be 
found.

A Somber Walkway (G)
  After ascending a stairway of clouds leading into the heavens, an individual 
would probably expect to find something surreal at the top. Many an explorer 
has been left disappointed, however, since this is nothing more than the 
Ascension Bluff Nursing Home. The architect thought that a stairway of clouds
would make the residents feel closer to the gods. Unfortunately, all this 
served to do was make this location less suitable for visitors and employees 
to frequent. Further to this, when one closely inspects the clouds, they will
come to the realization that they are not real clouds at all, but rather 
millions of tiny cotton balls affixed to a steel frame. Interestingly enough,
it seems that a nursing home in the clouds acquires quite the eclectic bunch 
of residents. Anyone who chances by a for a visit will find that this nursing
home contains more than just your ordinary sampling of senior citizens.

Entrance to Ascension Bluff
  At the entrance to the Ascension Bluff Nursing home the pathway widens into a
semi-circle of flagstones that are surrounded by several stout wooden 
benches. A low-set stone wall hugs all of these particulars, and three wide, 
curved steps lead up to the front entrance of the nursing home. This nursing 
home has been made to look like a lodge in hopes that the residents will feel
like they are simply here on vacation. The roof has a steep slope and the 
exterior of the building has been carefully crafted from wooden logs. Patio 
doors lead straight out to the front gardens and walkway from many locations 
along the front of the building. Even more light is brought into the nursing 
home via expansive, arched windows that take up much of the wall-space above
the patio doors.

  This section of the hallway has a resident's room leading off to either side.
It is clear at this point that the door at the end of the hall leads to the 
staff room since the large sign indicating it as such is visible from here.
There is a large painting hung on each side of the hallway and someone has 
hung several seashell wind chimes from the roof. Since these chimes really 
don't fit in with the overall decor, speculation that one of the residents 
hung these up would probably prove correct upon further investigation.

Staff Hallway
  This section of the hallway ends at the staff room. Here there are two large 
potted trees sitting in each corner of the hall. The hallway leads south 
toward the front entrance of the building. A painting of a beach has been 
hung on the wall over top of a bench that sits adjacent to the wall. The 
hallway floor is made of durable hardwood and has such a shine to it that it 
looks practically brand new. The janitor of this facility must take good care
of the floors here.

The Conservatory
  Being in this conservatory is like stepping into a tropical garden that is 
brimming with beautiful plants. The conservatory's structure is composed of 
glass and steel, and is roughly rectangular in format. At its central point 
the roof comes to a fifty foot high apex. That means the trees here sure can 
grow tall! The climate is carefully controlled to be hot and excessively 
humid. Vivid, picturesque, peaceful, and uplifting, this conservatory is a 
welcome retreat for anyone who seeks some solace.

The Conservatory
  This portion of the conservatory features a pond that contains tropical water
lilies. These lilies are huge, their blossoms span more than a foot across.
There are red, pink, and white blossoms and their smell is spectacular.
Around the pond grow trees draped in orchids. Exotic and curious, tropical 
pitcher plants also grow here. The pitcher plants are definitely one of the 
top conversation topics in the nursing home.

  This section of the conservatory is much like the last. There are many tall 
trees of several different varieties. The sun shines in through the glass 
roof and beams down warmly upon the plants and anyone standing in its way.
The air smells sweet and is heavy with moisture. The distant sound of a 
waterfall can be heard, but aside from that there is a serene silence about 
this place. A stylized statue of a gargoyle peers out from the southwest 
corner of the room, and bright flowers decorate the space around it.

The Conservatory
  This section of the conservatory has been designed to have a rock face take 
up the wall on its eastern side. A modest waterfall gently trickles down this
great wall of rock. Several varieties of ferns are growing through the rocks 
of this wall as well, creating a beautifully tranquil scene. The walkway here
forms a bit of a bridge and the waterfall's water mysteriously disappears 
underneath it, presumably to enter the nursing home's plumbing system in 
order to be recycled.

The air smells sweet and is heavy with moisture. The distant sound of a

this place. A stylized statue of a gargoyle peers out from the southwest

  Being in this conservatory is like stepping into a tropical garden that is 
brimming with beautiful plants. The conservatory's structure is composed of 
glass and steel, and is roughly rectangular in format. At its central point 
the roof comes to a fifty foot high apex. That means the trees here sure can 
grow tall! The climate is carefully controlled to be hot and excessively

  The center of the lounge is furnished with several small tables which are 
just large enough to fit four chairs to each. A few chandeliers also hang 
from the ceiling here. The floor has been beautified with hardwood and four 
strong white pillars carry the weight of the ceiling upon themselves. To the 
north is a kitchen, so this must be where folks enjoy sitting down for a nice
snack. To the south is a large sectional couch which would be perfect to 
relax upon while reading a book.

The Reception Area (2224)

The Reception Area
  The architectural team for this nursing home pondered the fact that in the 
beginning, these types of facilities started out as extensions to hospitals.
Therefore, to a certain extent, folks expect that a nursing home will retain 
that appearance. The team also recognized that the building's entrance is 
incredibly important in giving visitors that positive first impression of 
what the overall facility will be like. So the designer team worked hard to 
create a spacious, colorful, and inviting entrance. They wanted to imbue an 
overwhelming feeling of happiness within the individual as they took their 
first steps into the building. To do this, they utilized a palette of warm 
color tones for several large wall murals, as well as floors crafted with a 
tile mosaic finish. They added comfortable furniture to relax in, and spared 
no expense on an extravagant, cathedral ceiling, made perfect with the 
addition of incredible skylights.

A Somber Walkway
  The ground here has been built upon a study steel wire framework. It is so 
sturdy, in fact, that an individual is led to believe that they are walking 
on terra firma rather than treading 3000 feet up in the sky. This entire 
walkway has been carefully crafted into a beautiful courtyard that leads 
right up to the front doors of the nursing home. Dogwoods in a constant state
of bloom have been planted all along the walkway, their white blossoms intent
on mimicking the idea of clouds. White rose bushes were added to fill in gaps
between the trees, and the ground aside of the walkway is covered in actual 
growing cotton. Little bits of fluff float around in the air and tempt the 
formulation of a sneeze.

Entrance to Ascension Bluff
  At the entrance to the Ascension Bluff Nursing home the pathway widens into a
semi-circle of flagstones that are surrounded by several stout wooden 
benches. A low-set stone wall hugs all of these particulars, and three wide, 
curved steps lead up to the front entrance of the nursing home. This nursing 
home has been made to look like a lodge in hopes that the residents will feel
like they are simply here on vacation. The roof has a steep slope and the 
exterior of the building has been carefully crafted from wooden logs. Patio 
doors lead straight out to the front gardens and walkway from many locations 
along the front of the building. Even more light is brought into the nursing 
home via expansive, arched windows that take up much of the wall-space above
the patio doors.

  The walls of the activity room are completely painted into a mural that is

pushed up to each. The tables are littered with miscellaneous bits of 
unfinished pottery, watercolor paintings, and quilts. A rocking chair sits in
an unoccupied space closest to the door, and the rest of the space is filled

The Sunroom
  Since sunlight helps to alleviate certain types of mental illness, such as 
depression, the designers of this nursing home decided they would like to 
create a room that would let in the maximum amount of sun possible. All of 
the windows in this sunroom are made up of small panes of glass that have 
been separated by wood trim. The windows are fixed in place, since wherever 
they have been built, they take up the whole wall-space. The walls are 
nothing more than a frame to help support the windows, and then these windows
arc right into the roof. The floor here is made of hardwood that continues in
from the lounge to the east. A number of pieces of classic furniture have 
been proudly displayed in this room, almost too precious-looking to even sit 
on!

The Lounge
  A bright white kitchen has been set up here for use by the residents. The 
ability for them to cook their own meals is one that makes them feel more 
comfortable in the nursing home. This kitchen is especially nice, because it 
has a few special features. The refrigeration device here magically refills 
itself whenever a food item is taken out of it, there is a wood burning stove
that magically replenishes its stock of wood, and there is a really advanced 
plumbing system that advances nothing less than the most pure water from 
gleaming metal taps at several different sink stations.

  You stand before a HUGE pair of thrones.  The thrones are, if anything,
more decorated with gold and gems than the pillars outside.  You begin to
wonder if the royalty has some sort of black market thing going on with the
dwarves.  

[ Exits: west ]
(Golden Aura) The king sits on his throne, brooding silently.

  You step out from the light forest behind you and onto a dusty road. All 
before you the growth has stopped abruptly. Not only does it appear someone 
has clear-cut any sign of flora, but there is also a massive pit in the 
ground. It looks as if the pit has been cut straight down with only a narrow 
zigzagging path leading to its depths. Before the pit, however, is a small 
camp made up of roughshod tents and white stone buildings. It looks as if a 
decent wind would carry this camp away, over the cliff, and into the pit.
Every sound seems to echo off of the walls of the pit, making it impossible 
to determine their origin. Barking voices can be heard above the din of metal
on stone in the distance.

A Dusty Crossroads
  The noise here is unbearable. The screaming of stone being hewn by picks and 
hammers, the screech of metal carts against rusted rails, and the constant 
barking all combine into an intolerable cacophony. Tattered burlap tents open
to the south and east, each one emitting more barks. The tent to the east is 
quite a bit larger than the one to the south. A sign can be seen above the 
tent to the south. To the west leads a path down into the pit. You can also 
see the front door to the white building. Unlike the two closest tents, a 
third tent stands atop some rubble to the west. This tent is smaller than the
other two, but is much less tattered and has been erected strong enough to 
keep out any debris that may fly in with the breeze.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

which leads to the Queen's Castle, another piece of a building genius. 
Nobles, workers and many other people are walking on the same road and
almost all of them are on their way to either speak with the queen or court
the queen's daughter Elana.  Maybe you should join them?  The smell of
flowers helps to give your visit a wonderful sense to it all.

  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.

  As you enter the city gates, you notice some of the beauty and luxury
Pompeii offers.  Under your feet, the street is paved with smooth limestone,
and elaborately constructed buildings are all around.  To the west, you see
a sign on a door.  To the north, the city waits to be explored.  Bronze
oil lanterns in each doorway light the street and allow the spectacular
murals on the walls to be seen.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

>>    Entrance to The Dungeon (G)
  A small stairway stands before you.  Screams of the tortured souls ring
out from the eerie stairway.  You ponder if you should go down or not,
wondering if the screams you hear are the souls of dead adventurers that had
intruded.  As you stand pondering, a wind blows by and sends a deep chill
down your spine; you are momentarily paralyzed, but quickly recover.  You
sense something sinister in this evil place, but you aren't sure exactly
what.  To the west, loud clanks and pounding noises ring out from a small
building.  And to the east is a quiet, medium-sized hut.

Stairway to the Dungeon
  Being careful not to trip, you slowly proceed down this stairway.  You
are hit immediately by the rancid smell of decay and wonder if you should
turn back as you run into a sticky spider's web.  Startled, you jump back as
a rat runs over your feet.  Your will seems to falter as you hear unhumanly
moans from farther down.  Taking a deep breath, you gather your courage and
charge downward towards the noise, unprepared for what lies ahead.

Museum of Wonders
  You enter into a museum unlike any other, as you are literally swept away
with the realism of your surroundings.  Your eyes begin to glaze over and
you have to fight to regain your bearings.  This is not real and these
places no longer exist.  These are merely replicas...  Or are they?

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  As you walk through the double doors into the temple, the first thing
you notice is the remarkable difference from what you expected. Judging
simply by the outer appearence, you would have said that this place could
have been any sort of office building for the government. But with its
oriental tapestries on the walls and lovely arabic rugs covering the floors,
you think it could be anything *except* an office building.

The edge of a steamy marsh (G)
  As you turn off the swampy path, you realize that the loggers back in Aylor 
were not as drunk as they should have been from all the Firebreather they had
been drinking. Clearly visible, now that the loggers have chopped through the
undergrowth and the trees, is the trail you followed to see for yourself if 
the wild stories the loggers were telling were spun out of firebreather, or 
if a real adventure could be here. You stand at the very edge of the steaming
wetland, hearing the small chitterings, buzzings and splashes that are 
associated with places such as this; however, there is also a very faint 
chanting on the breeze that doesn't belong here. As you look around, you 
notice that like any marshland or wetland, this one is full of greenery, 
though there is a multitude of colors from flowers, insects, and decay mixed 
with the trees. As you continue to look, you notice three paths branching 
from this point, going deeper into the marsh, and of course, the way back to 
the swampy path.

A muddy path
  The path you are following is a sign of things to come it would seem. 
The trees here are tall, their large roots poking through the brown mud that
serves as a path.  The sounds of insects and chittering animals begins to
surround you as you move deeper into the marsh, and the heat mixed with
water vapor makes the air shimmer.  There is a light breeze, but it is by no
means a cooling one.  Through the trees to the left and right you can barely
make out dark, shady-looking pools of water.  The sound of frogs and other
aquatic animals drift to your ears.  Still the chanting continues, you
remember the loggers mentioning the chanting as well, and they also
mentioned dangers; fierce tribal lizardmen, and something about large rats
and moving trees.  Ahead the path continues deeper into the steamy quagmire,
though you can still return to the edge of this untamed land and try another
path or simply leave before you find those lizardmen.

  The vegetation here has grown up over what little path there was in this
swamp.  Thick brown tree trunks block both east and west travel, and vines
with brightly colored flowers cover the path, along with several other
plants.  Moss grows all over everything here, and fungi of all sorts seem to
spring out of every crevice and crack in the bark of the trees and vines. 
It is extremely dark here, and the air is heavy with humidity and the scents
of flourishing undergrowth.  Ahead it looks as if this vegetation will
recede again and let in light.

Opening in the undergrowth
  Here the undergrowth is less than to the south, the path slopes up
slightly, and the mud is a little drier than in the surrounding area.  From
here you can see a bit farther in all directions.  To the north, and
slightly east, you can see the sparkling of sunlight on water, though only
brief glimpses of the body of water through the many trees that surround it.
There appears to be some form of rock formation directly north, though it is
covered in moss and plant life.  To the west, you see some sort of thorny
plant with long spines, and it does not look possible to penetrate the
undergrowth in that direction, even if you did wish to risk your skin on
those spines.

  As you walk along this path, you notice faint signs of tracks.  Also
there are some discarded tools lying in the mud off to one side of the
trail.  It strikes you suddenly that this is the first time you can truly
call any cleared path in this marsh a trail.  There are still tall, thick
trees with vines and flowers growing around them, and the trail is still
dotted with shallow dips where water has collected, but it has been cleared
of most of the vegetation that thrives in the steamy climate.  To the east,
thick undergrowth and vines block any passage, except perhaps by the small
animals who call the marshlands home, while west will take you back to the
slight rise in the land.  North you can now plainly see the large lake,
though it is still a ways off.  The mound you first noticed on your way
along the path rises to the west and just to the north.  There is a faint
sound of rustling and hissing coming from farther to the north.

Close to a lake
  From here you can see the lake more clearly than before.  Thick
vegetation is all around, but you notice that the trees on the lakeshore are
not growing quite so close together.  West from here the mound has an
opening, and appears to be a den of some sort.  The hissing and rustling you
heard is coming from inside the mound, and there are a lot of tracks leading
in and out of the opening.  There are still trees to the east and it appears
that one or two are dead, there are a couple of logs on the ground, covered
in fungi and moss which glows a soft green.  The scent of mud, decaying
vegetation and water fills your nostrils and the sounds of insects and small
animals fill your ears as you move along the path.

  You have entered the den of the Lizardmen, the skins of many animals lie
on the floor or hang from the rocky walls.  Even here the moss grows on the
rock, and bones are strewn over the uneven floor.  Painted skins on the
walls show various states of a hunt, and there is evidence in one corner of
someone's work on a new bow.  The smell here is wild and unpleasant, and you
sense that you are being watched, though it is impossible to tell what
direction the watcher is staring from.  It may be best to leave while you
have a chance.  Perhaps you have already stayed too long.

  Calmness, warmth and serenity are the three first impressions you get 
from the large underground dome.  Two rows of elegantly curved, white
marble pillars lead all the way up to a bright white statue of Light's 
deity, Radience, standing there with open arms to welcome those in
need of help and the downtrodden.  The soft pure light coming from 
the columns bathe the dome in a soft glow, inviting you to come closer
and bask in it's warmth.  A deep soothing voice comes from your left :
'Is there anything Light can do to help you on your perilous way?'
When you turn towards the voice, you immediately notice the wrinkles
around the woman's bright green eyes, the graying of the once blonde
hair and the still athletic posture and tread as she approaches.
Upon coming closer she falls silent and only the white robes rustle
softly against her, she looks at you with a surprising freshness
and deep-rooted intelligence.  The stylish hand-and-a-half sword
hanging on her weathered belt warns you that she's always on her toes,
probably because evil can lurk everywhere, but still she smilingly
invites you : 'We also sell potions and other goods, if that's what 
you're looking for.'

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The edge of a steamy marsh (G)
  As you turn off the swampy path, you realize that the loggers back in Aylor 
were not as drunk as they should have been from all the Firebreather they had
been drinking. Clearly visible, now that the loggers have chopped through the
undergrowth and the trees, is the trail you followed to see for yourself if 
the wild stories the loggers were telling were spun out of firebreather, or 
if a real adventure could be here. You stand at the very edge of the steaming
wetland, hearing the small chitterings, buzzings and splashes that are 
associated with places such as this; however, there is also a very faint 
chanting on the breeze that doesn't belong here. As you look around, you 
notice that like any marshland or wetland, this one is full of greenery, 
though there is a multitude of colors from flowers, insects, and decay mixed 
with the trees. As you continue to look, you notice three paths branching 
from this point, going deeper into the marsh, and of course, the way back to 
the swampy path.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
A beautifully feathered duck is at home in the marshlands.
(Hidden) (Red Aura) A bandit sneaks around the marshes, looking for treasure.
A very large brown bear searches through the undergrowth for food.
(Hidden) (White Aura) A human stalks the marshlands, hunting food.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east down ]

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  As you head on further south through the encampment you come across the 
training fields of The Tribes. You see many of the Amazon practicing 
drills with weapons, combat formations and general physical to some new 
trainees. "You, there, what is your name?" She shouts. A muscular wolfen 
answers "Kallendbor M'am." "Attack me Kallendbor...NOW!" Shouts Lessandra.
Kallendbor leaps into the air with a ferocious strike that would rip a man in
half but Lessandra easily sidesteps and sends him spinning with one fluid 
motion. "You see students, it's not the size of your opponent that really 
matters, but what his current position own force against him. All because I 
knew where to move and more importantly how to move my opponent. Now go and 
do your daily line drills." Lessandra lectures. She then turns her gaze 
towards you and asks "How may I help you?"

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Calmness, warmth and serenity are the three first impressions you get 
from the large underground dome.  Two rows of elegantly curved, white
marble pillars lead all the way up to a bright white statue of Light's 
deity, Radience, standing there with open arms to welcome those in
need of help and the downtrodden.  The soft pure light coming from 
the columns bathe the dome in a soft glow, inviting you to come closer
and bask in it's warmth.  A deep soothing voice comes from your left :
'Is there anything Light can do to help you on your perilous way?'
When you turn towards the voice, you immediately notice the wrinkles
around the woman's bright green eyes, the graying of the once blonde
hair and the still athletic posture and tread as she approaches.
Upon coming closer she falls silent and only the white robes rustle
softly against her, she looks at you with a surprising freshness
and deep-rooted intelligence.  The stylish hand-and-a-half sword
hanging on her weathered belt warns you that she's always on her toes,
probably because evil can lurk everywhere, but still she smilingly
invites you : 'We also sell potions and other goods, if that's what 
you're looking for.'

The edge of a steamy marsh (G)
  As you turn off the swampy path, you realize that the loggers back in Aylor 
were not as drunk as they should have been from all the Firebreather they had
been drinking. Clearly visible, now that the loggers have chopped through the
undergrowth and the trees, is the trail you followed to see for yourself if 
the wild stories the loggers were telling were spun out of firebreather, or 
if a real adventure could be here. You stand at the very edge of the steaming
wetland, hearing the small chitterings, buzzings and splashes that are 
associated with places such as this; however, there is also a very faint 
chanting on the breeze that doesn't belong here. As you look around, you 
notice that like any marshland or wetland, this one is full of greenery, 
though there is a multitude of colors from flowers, insects, and decay mixed 
with the trees. As you continue to look, you notice three paths branching 
from this point, going deeper into the marsh, and of course, the way back to 
the swampy path.

The den of the Lizardmen
  You have entered the den of the Lizardmen, the skins of many animals lie
on the floor or hang from the rocky walls.  Even here the moss grows on the
rock, and bones are strewn over the uneven floor.  Painted skins on the
walls show various states of a hunt, and there is evidence in one corner of
someone's work on a new bow.  The smell here is wild and unpleasant, and you
sense that you are being watched, though it is impossible to tell what
direction the watcher is staring from.  It may be best to leave while you
have a chance.  Perhaps you have already stayed too long.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Calmness, warmth and serenity are the three first impressions you get 
from the large underground dome.  Two rows of elegantly curved, white
marble pillars lead all the way up to a bright white statue of Light's 
deity, Radience, standing there with open arms to welcome those in
need of help and the downtrodden.  The soft pure light coming from 
the columns bathe the dome in a soft glow, inviting you to come closer
and bask in it's warmth.  A deep soothing voice comes from your left :
'Is there anything Light can do to help you on your perilous way?'
When you turn towards the voice, you immediately notice the wrinkles
around the woman's bright green eyes, the graying of the once blonde
hair and the still athletic posture and tread as she approaches.
Upon coming closer she falls silent and only the white robes rustle
softly against her, she looks at you with a surprising freshness
and deep-rooted intelligence.  The stylish hand-and-a-half sword
hanging on her weathered belt warns you that she's always on her toes,
probably because evil can lurk everywhere, but still she smilingly
invites you : 'We also sell potions and other goods, if that's what 
you're looking for.'

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  You step down from the marble floor of the temple and find yourself on well 
worn steps cut into living rock that are lit by magic orbs reflecting light 
from a myriad of glittering gems. As you reach the bottom, you find a long 
cavern leading east and west. In the centre of the floor is a large rock, 
glittering with hieroglyphics formed from green gemstones. Perhaps you should
look at the rock!

Expedition Hut (G)
  The crawlway empties out into a large chamber.  Every visible surface is
covered with items guaranteed to make exploration less hazardous.  Some of
the equipment is quite strange, as if the pieces were all handcrafted from
different parts of the realm.  Everything seems to fit neatly into small
fissures in the room's stalagmites and stalactites.  One wall is lined with
exotic potions that quietly bubble away, ready to assist explorers. 
Organizing everything into place is a young man.  Approaching you, he seems
almost ageless.  You wonder if the gems you have seen around possess a power
you can not fully understand.  Examining your equipment, he asks What can I
do to aid you in your travels?

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one

  You look in wonder at the many bright colors in this room.  Even for
Bards there are many.  You see a large man serving customers ahead of you in
the line, each of whom walk away sniffing some unusual and obviously foreign
delicacy.  The only delicacy you can even guess at seems to be a little
carton full of what looks like cheese.  Moving ahead, you can see more of
the back of the stand, in which lies two barrels, which are constantly
making noise which can even be heard over the chatter of the customers.  You
look into the cup of a passing, just-served customer and see that the liquid
is cherry-colored.  The liquid is bubbly and noisy.  In a far corner of the
stand, you see some rocks hopping up and down all by themselves!  In the
other far corner, you see a metal vat, the contents of which are out of your
sight, but you guess is the same as that which lies about it, a
yellow-orange pudding!  As the customer in front of you moves away, you
realize you are next.

The Silver Moon - Musical Supplies and Other Useful Things (G)
  The scent of fir swirls through the air from an alcove where a tree
grows.  Shelves containing all manner of items used to make music are lining
the room.  Various instrument cases of all shapes and sizes rest against the
walls below the shelves.  Taliesin sits in a chair, playing his harp.  He
calls out "Diarmund, Grianne, would you bring me some more light, children?"
A rustling in the fir trees draws your eyes, and two owls emerge and fly
over to Taliesin's upturned palms.  A rainbow of light leaps from his head
and surrounds the owls and his hands, then disappears, leaving only a
glowing ball within them.  As Taliesin shifts the position of his chair to
better use the light, the two owls settle on a stand near him.  Taliesin
radiates gentleness and kindness as he states, "We always have time for the
young, don't we Diarmund and Grianne?  Come in and be welcome."  The two
owls look at each other and nod.

Up the central stairwell (G)
  A spiral staircase funnels a throng of shoppers in and out of the mall to
shops which populate this floor. Bards and other folks mingle in the open
portions of the plaza. The constant drone of crowds is occasionally
punctuated with a louder twang of an off-key instrument. Fewer people
climb the spiral leading up to the next level of the hall. Pale statuary
is just visible between the uppermost balusters.

  Rarely in your life have you seen a room with such colour!  Reds and
greens assault your eyes, mixed with yellows, blues, and almost evey other
shade in the spectrum.  Gaily coloured paintings adorn the walls, clashing
with the rugs strewn across the floor.  What holds your attention, though,
are the costumes.  Rack upon rack of them stand here, filled with clothing
and props from all walks of life the fevered imaginings of some demented
tailor.  A skilled Bard could become any person he chose whithin minutes in
this wonderous room.  A caveman, a warrior, a vagabond, a cow!  The large
oaken counter is draped with a many-coloured cloth, the Bard's trademark. 
As you approach, you think to yourself exactly what manner of man or beast
you wish to appear as today....

  The room you have entered is unlike any you have seen before.  The golden
light from a set of bronze lanterns suspended from the ceiling reflects off
of hundreds of the highest quality musical instruments hung from the walls,
from the most exotic to the most mundane, shining gold or silver or with the
dull sheen of leather.  The southernmost wall is hung not with instruments
but with hundreds of pages of sheet music of a thousand different styles and
authorships.  As you enter and begin looking about, a middle aged woman with
a swath of silver hair that falls past her waist emerges from a previously
unseen backroom.  Although she is dressed in the robes of a priest or
magician, the calluses on her hands are those of a long time musician.  "How
many I be of services to ye?"  She inquires in a soft, melodic voice.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.
