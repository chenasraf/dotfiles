Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

Approaching Diamond Castle (1581)

In front of Diamond Castle
  Doric columns of pure diamond support this magnificent castle.  Beams of
light encircle the dwelling, illuminating the crystal with an holy
brilliance and a divine majesty.  You slowly raise your hand up to feel the
outer wall, and despite having been exposed to the elements, it is as soft
and tender as a baby's skin, while still having an untold of inner
resilience.  You bow your head in respect for the castle, and notice a
welcome mat on the ground.  The mat is completely lavish as well, having
been woven with intertwined strands of gold and silver.  If the exterior is
any indication, the beauty and grace to be found within will surpass any
you have seen.  

[ Exits: (east) west ]
A citizen of this strange city walks around lazily here.
A citizen of this strange city is here smiling at you.
A caspian guard grins wickedly here as he tortures passers-by.

>>    Inside Diamond Castle
  After opening the diamond gate and entering the castle, your senses are
overcome with amazement and wonder.  Even the inner walls of this
magnificent castle are made of diamond.  As you step across the floor, the
shock of your feet smacking the ground is absorbed, and instead of making a
cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which
separates the rest of the castle from the arborium, and to the south is the
castle dining room.  The castle hallway continues east.

Inside the dining room (1579)

Inside the kitchen
  The various cooks and maids gather together here, as it is their "home
base," so to speak.  You smell so much stuff at once that your nose cannot
register it all: beef stew, delectible fried shrimp, golden brown chicken
...  There is just so much to cook that the chefs have problems keeping up
with it all.  The serving maids are running back and forth so much that
there is a huge rut in the floor where their feet tread so hastily.  A huge
cauldron hordes the space in the kitchen's center, and it is there where the
cooks magically bake, fry, and marinate everything.  How they do it, you
don't know.  The dining room is above you and a tiny door to the west
functions as a service entrance to the kitchen.  

[ Exits: (west) up ]
A cook is here running frantically back and forth.
A maid is here trying to annoy the cooks.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand at the edge of the Nenukon. A dark and twisted region of the world.
Deep within lies what is said to be the ultimate evil, and also the resting 
place of the only thing that can stop it. Beyond the Nenukon is said to be 
the Empire of The Far Country, a land of warriors, where the governing tribes
themselves are in a constant state of war.

Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'
Spell Number: 121

With the power of positive thought, a psionicist can create a barrier of
positive energy around him/herself.  This reduces the damage inflicted by
beings of negative or evil energies.

One advantage of being a mental ability is that this spell can complement
the opposing anti-alignment spell protection good, where the religious
variants will not protect from both alignments at once.  The order of the
spells cast no longer matters.

Primary stat: Wisdom
Affected by : Luck.

Stats for Each Class:

Warrior
* STRENGTH is the primary stat 
* DEXTERITY and CONSTITUTION should be next
* LUCK also helps in many areas
* Warriors have little use for WISDOM and INTELLIGENCE
 
Thief
* DEXTERITY is the primary stat
* LUCK is also very important
* Next focus on STRENGTH and/or CONSTITUTION
* Thieves have little use for WISDOM and INTELLIGENCE

Mage
* INTELLIGENCE is the primary stat
* WISDOM is also important
* Next focus on LUCK
* Keep STRENGTH, DEXTERITY and CONSTITUTION all at moderate levels

Cleric
* WISDOM is the primary stat
* INTELLIGENCE and LUCK are next in level of importance
* Keep STRENGTH, DEXTERITY and CONSTITUTION all at moderate levels

Psionicist (Psi)
* Both INTELLIGENCE and WISDOM are primary stats
* LUCK is also very important
* STRENGTH, DEXTERITY and CONSTITUTION should be kept at moderate 
  levels

Ranger
* CONSTITUTION is the primary stat
* WISDOM is also important
* Next choose one of either STRENGTH/DEXTERITY (for attack skills) or 
  INTELLIGENCE (for magical spells)
* LUCK is also useful

Paladin
* CONSTITUTION and INTELLIGENCE are primary stats
* WISDOM is also important
* Choose an EXTREME ALIGNMENT (very good or very evil)

How Each Stat is Useful:

STRENGTH (STR)
* Determines how hard your non-magical attacks hit (damage by weapons)
* Determines the total weight you can carry
* Increases your overall hitroll and damroll

INTELLIGENCE (INT)
* Determines how much each practice increases your percentage in a 
  skill/spell
* Helps you 'save' spells (reduce damage and avoid harmful effects)
* Determines how much mana you will gain when you increase a level

WISDOM (WIS)
* Determines amount of healing granted by heal and similar spells
* Determines amount of protection granted by sanctuary and other 
  protective spells
* Determines how many practice sessions you will gain when you level
* Helps you avoid the effects of maladictions
* Increases chance of successfully casting cures for maladictions

DEXTERITY (DEX)
* Makes it tougher for opponents to hit you.
* Helps determine how many times in a round you will hit
* Helps you dodge and parry hits
* Increases the maximum number of items you can carry

CONSTITUTION (CON)
* Decreases amount of damage taken in combat
* Determines how many hit points you will gain when you increase a 
  level

LUCK
* Helps you dodge and hit more often
* Helps you do more damage with spells and avoid any harmful effects
* Increases number of trains and stats obtained when raising a level
* Increases chance of extra quest points when completing a quest
* Helps determine your chances of adding magical affects to items 
  (with enchant armor, resonate, solidify, etc.)
* Allows you to hit multiple times with many skills 

* As a newbie DO NOT train hit points, mana or moves.

* Extra practices can be converted to trains. Extra trains can be 
  saved for a higher level. If you check out 'help maxstats' you can see 
  when trains start to cost more and at what level ranges you are allowed 
  to train more in any given stat.

* A simple plan is to train all stats until each stat costs two 
  trains. After this, always maximize your primary and secondary stats, 
  then use the remaining training sessions to balance out all the other 
  stats.

Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

[ Exits: east south west ]
An old veteran stands behind the bar, ready to serve you a cool drink.

Gazing over a Wide Grassland
  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

A shady spot in the plains (1613)

Near a grove of ancient trees
  You find yourself on the outer edge of a large grove of trees. They seem 
ancient, their thick, grey-brown trunks big around enough to build a house 
within and reaching toward the open sky. The branches are heavy with 
greenery, and the sounds of chirping and squabbling birds drift down from the
treetops. Other sounds come to you from within the ancient grove. The sounds 
of children playing, a trickle of water, and the occasional call of an adult.
A small stream runs in from the west, disappearing into the grove of trees, 
and its crystal clear waters reveal darting fish and small insects. The soft 
carpet of grass and clover is cool and damp to the touch, and this looks like
a nice spot to rest before continuing the trek across the plains.

Inside a hidden clearing
    The clearing looks even larger now that you are inside the grove of 
ancient trees.  A sparkling lake is a few feet to one side and the stream 
empties into its still waters. You can see many people moving around here, 
some going to and from the lake, either swimming or bringing back pails of 
water to the tents which dot the clearing. The source of the smoke is 
evident, now, as you make note of a large bonfire with several spits of meat 
roasting over it. You can, also, make out a paddock, of sorts, where several 
horses are hobbled.  At the far end of the clearing, a large bull hide tent
stands, as if to watch over the dark-skinned inhabitants as they go about 
their daily lives.

Before the large tent
  While not exactly set apart from all the others, this tent does have
space around it.  It is much larger and more ornate than the plain tents you
have seen in the Nulan'Boar camp.  Out here the ground is flat, but there is
grass growing, unlike in the center of the camp.  There appears to be smoke
drifting from a hole in the roof of the tent, and a sense of power seems to
surround the dwelling.  As you look over the view from here, you see a few
people, both men and women, enter and exit the tent.  Many of the women who
enter the tent are dressed in what appear to be robes of soft white calf's
hide, and all have a peaceful look about them.  All of the men who visit are
armed, and most have a gait that suggests they are more comfortable on
horseback.  Wherever this is, it must be a place of importance.

  The inside of the tent is cool and dim.  The scent of leather is heavy in
the air, and there is an undercurrent of incense and smoke as well.  The
floor of the tent is covered with thick layers of deerskin, and small
torches rest in stands around the tent, giving off a dim light.  A wooden
rack on the northern wall holds a few trophies: antlers, long horns from
bulls, a few rusted weapons, and a large horn bow.  On the eastern side of
the tent is an ornate, beaded curtain, and the western side of the tent is
dominated by a raised bed of branches covered with layers of skins.  It
appears that the central area of the tent is where meetings can take place,
as a carved chair sits just in front of the trophy rack, facing the opening
of the tent.

Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

Underground Valley
  The light at the end of the tunnel!!  You feel so relieved after being
cramped up in the caverns.  You must be getting closer to the Citadel.  From
a distance, you can hear the warcries and clashing of swords..  Turning your
head towards the sounds, you come upon a small valley that has been burned
down by fighting.  You step closer to the burning bushes and trees and
hear the sounds grow stronger.  You must be close to the battlefield!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

  At the far end of the wine cellar the dust has settled pretty thick. Cobwebs 
hang limply from the ceiling and the clatter of small claws on the cold stone
emerges from the darkness. Footprints and scuff marks mar the dust on the 
floor along the walls. Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling and 
most of the bottle slots have bottles in them. The bottles are turned 
regularly and only have a light coating of dust on them. One of the racks 
along the north wall looks a little odd, like it isn't sitting flush against 
the wall. The floor is marked in front of this section in particular and is 
perhaps worth a closer look.

  At the far end of the wine cellar the dust has settled pretty thick. Cobwebs 
hang limply from the ceiling and the clatter of small claws on the cold stone
emerges from the darkness. Footprints and scuff marks mar the dust on the 
floor along the walls. Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling and 
most of the bottle slots have bottles in them. The bottles are turned 
regularly and only have a light coating of dust on them. One of the racks

slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.

  In this hidden room is the Earl's private collection and the wine is only 
brought out on special occasions. The staff rarely come so deep into the 
cellars so it makes a perfect hiding place. There are some extremely rare 
vintages of wine that would be worth a small fortune if sold to the right 
person. There are thick cobwebs in the room and small carcasses of rats are 
caught in the larger webs. The skittering of many clawed feet echo off the 
cold stone walls leaving you uncertain as to which direction it is coming 
from. A gust of wind through the open door blows a cobweb onto you, which

  At the far end of the wine cellar the dust has settled pretty thick. Cobwebs 
hang limply from the ceiling and the clatter of small claws on the cold stone
emerges from the darkness. Footprints and scuff marks mar the dust on the 
floor along the walls. Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling and 
most of the bottle slots have bottles in them. The bottles are turned 
regularly and only have a light coating of dust on them. One of the racks 
along the north wall looks a little odd, like it isn't sitting flush against 
the wall. The floor is marked in front of this section in particular and is 
perhaps worth a closer look.

[ Exits: north east ]
     (Magic) Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling.

Kitchen
  The kitchen is a large and spacious room that is a hub of activity for most 
of the day. A fire pit near one wall has a boar, all basted with spices, 
slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.
A very old door leads down to the cellars.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Grand hall
  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
     (Magic) A large chandelier, adorned with many candles, lights up the hall.
     (Magic) A deep red carpet runs the length of the main hall.
(Translucent) A wisp of smoke curls in the air, carrying with it a hint of tobacco.
(Translucent) (Golden Aura) An elderly dwarf is carrying a decanter of brandy and some fresh
goblets.
A portrait of a man in shining armour holding his sword hangs on the wall.
On the wall hangs a portrait of an unsmiling young lady with her mother.
An unsmiling young man in clerical robes looks down at you from a gilded frame.
Made from a deep red velvet, these drapes frame the archways to the east and west.

The stables
  A cacophony of animal sounds is coming from a large wooden building, whose 
doors are flung wide open. This is quite obviously the Earl's stables, which 
houses a wondrous variety of creatures, some of which he uses as steeds and 
others which he keeps as work animals or living trophies. The Earl's staff 
are busy looking after the animals, feeding them and mucking out the stalls.

[ Exits: south up ]
A proud griffon rests quietly in his stall.
(Hidden) A rustling in the hay indicates the presence of rodents.
(Golden Aura) A pure white unicorn dips her head at your approach.
(Golden Aura) A black pegasus, wings folded against his sides, snorts at your presence.
As still as a rock, a giant lizard is sleeping in her stable.
(Red Aura) A wyvern is resting in his stall after a large meal.

Behind the manor
  At the rear of the manor is the door to the kitchens by which the cooks and 
other staff come and go. There are some rubbish bins, well-sealed, off to one
side of the door and hidden behind some low shrubbery. To all intents and 
purposes they are unseen by those who do not want to see them. Through one of
the windows you can see the cooks are bustling about the kitchen. The door 
opens briefly and one of the staff hurries towards the rear of the estate, 
unaware of your presence in their haste.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
     (Magic) Low shrubbery grows beside the manor walls.
     (Magic) A white stone path is bordered by leafy green hedges.

  The kitchen is a large and spacious room that is a hub of activity for most 
of the day. A fire pit near one wall has a boar, all basted with spices, 
slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.
A very old door leads down to the cellars.

  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

East wing
  The east wing of the manor has many doors along its length. To the north, 
halfway along the hallway, double doors with glass panels show the room 
within. A little further along is a door in the south wall with a large iron 
lock. Considering the wealth on display in the manor, there must be treasured
items within. At the far end of the east wing are highly ornate double doors 
with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along
the entire length of the hallway. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles.

Grand staircase (1618)

Grand hall
  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

[ Exits: (north) east south west ]
     (Magic) A large chandelier, adorned with many candles, lights up the hall.
     (Magic) A deep red carpet runs the length of the main hall.
A portrait of a man in shining armour holding his sword hangs on the wall.
An unsmiling young man in clerical robes looks down at you from a gilded frame.
(Translucent) A wisp of smoke curls in the air, carrying with it a hint of tobacco.
On the wall hangs a portrait of an unsmiling young lady with her mother.
Made from a deep red velvet, these drapes frame the archways to the east and west.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Kitchen
  The kitchen is a large and spacious room that is a hub of activity for most 
of the day. A fire pit near one wall has a boar, all basted with spices, 
slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.
The sinks are full of hot soapy water and dirty dishes waiting to be washed.
A very old door leads down to the cellars.

[ Exits: (north) south (down) ]
     (Magic) A handful of chopped vegetables looks deliciously scrumptious.
     (Magic) This knife is great for cutting vegetables.

(Golden Aura) Davven is standing on a wooden stool, washing the dirty dishes.

Wine cellar
  At the far end of the wine cellar the dust has settled pretty thick. Cobwebs 
hang limply from the ceiling and the clatter of small claws on the cold stone
emerges from the darkness. Footprints and scuff marks mar the dust on the 
floor along the walls. Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling and 
most of the bottle slots have bottles in them. The bottles are turned 
regularly and only have a light coating of dust on them. One of the racks 
along the north wall looks a little odd, like it isn't sitting flush against 
the wall. The floor is marked in front of this section in particular and is 
perhaps worth a closer look.

[ Exits: east ]
     (Magic) Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling.
     (Magic) Cobwebs hang limply from the cold stone ceiling.
(Golden Aura) A centipede skitters along the cold, stone floor of the cellar.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Wine cellar
  In this hidden room is the Earl's private collection and the wine is only 
brought out on special occasions. The staff rarely come so deep into the 
cellars so it makes a perfect hiding place. There are some extremely rare 
vintages of wine that would be worth a small fortune if sold to the right 
person. There are thick cobwebs in the room and small carcasses of rats are 
caught in the larger webs. The skittering of many clawed feet echo off the 
cold stone walls leaving you uncertain as to which direction it is coming 
from. A gust of wind through the open door blows a cobweb onto you, which 
adheres to your clothing.

[ Exits: south ]
     (Magic) Wine racks line the walls from floor to ceiling.
     (Magic) Thick, sticky cobwebs decorate the walls and wine racks.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

  The light at the end of the tunnel!!  You feel so relieved after being
cramped up in the caverns.  You must be getting closer to the Citadel.  From
a distance, you can hear the warcries and clashing of swords..  Turning your
head towards the sounds, you come upon a small valley that has been burned
down by fighting.  You step closer to the burning bushes and trees and
hear the sounds grow stronger.  You must be close to the battlefield!

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand before the gates of a large fair.  A nearby sign proclaims this
to be the Great Tournament of Illoria.  Nearby, you hear melodic tunes
playing, and the mixed aromas of cooked meat and fresh pies fill the air. 
You are glad you came on the day you did - it seems this fair is not to be
missed!  

[ Exits: north south ]
(Golden Aura) A guard stands before the gate, and watches the fair attendants come and go.
The Gateguard exclaims, "Welcome to the fair!"
The Gateguard exclaims, "You'll find lots of excitement here. Don't miss
 the tournament!"
The Gateguard pauses.
The Gateguard says, "I can never remember the rest of my lines..."

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

  The path that you followed has led you to an uninviting cave.  It is dark

Wondering what could be happening ahead you decide to continue into the cave
and explore.

  The path that you followed has led you to an uninviting cave.  It is dark
and eerie, your judgement tells you that it is not wise to proceed further. 
In the distance you hear the faint sounds of screams and swords slashing. 
Wondering what could be happening ahead you decide to continue into the cave
and explore.

Your disgust is overshadowed by fear when you notice a hunched over figure

The Nyx's Room
  The stench of mold surrounds you in the dark cave.  It is quiet, the only
sounds to be heard are the dripping of water from the ceiling, and a faint
scuffling sound.  Wondering what the sound is you explore the cave further. 
The walls are smooth and slimy, your feet squelch with every step you take. 
Looking down you notice the floor is covered with worms and beetles..  Yuck!
Your disgust is overshadowed by fear when you notice a hunched over figure
in the corner of the room.  

[ Exits: up ]
( 2) A dark pair of sleeves, woven from a spider's web.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Picturesque Pond
  Cat-tails, lily pads with various colored water lilies, and spatterdock
decorate the surface of the pond.  Ducks dive under the water in search of
food.  Going a bit into the water brings forth more marine life and
different kinds of plants.  Where the sun can still reach the bottom of the
pond, wigeon grass, milfoil, and coontail grow heartily.  The pond is very
deep in the middle, and to get across one must be able to swim very well, or
own a boat.

Edge Of The Pond
  Green fern is growing along the shore of the pond.  A small trail leads
from the pond to the north.  An old tree stands crooked and its blue leaves
touch the surface of the water.  It almost appears as if the water colored
the leaves.  The trees are spaciously positioned around the path, yet their
branches and leaves touch, forming a closed off roof.  The occasional
sunbeam manages the get through the lush trees.

the shade is different.  The faeries must have been very busy in this part

The brown thrasher lands near the snuckleberry bush.
She hops over to the bush and picks a snuckleberry and eats it whole.
The brown thrasher takes flight and begins singing again.
Mushroom Patch
  The path narrows here, giving way to the thousands of mushrooms that grow
on the sides of the path.  The mushrooms are harvested for eating, and grow
back almost overnight.  The snuckles use the mushrooms for a major part of
their diet, although they eat other things as well.  Birds are sitting in
the trees singing a lovely song to entertain those who are picking
mushrooms.  

[ Exits: east west ]
     (Magic) (Hum) Magical mushrooms are growing in clusters.
(Translucent) Sam Snuckle walks around trying to get his business off to a good start.
(Invis) (Golden Aura) The faerie flies about adding color to the plants.

to be the Great Tournament of Illoria.  Nearby, you hear melodic tunes
playing, and the mixed aromas of cooked meat and fresh pies fill the air. 
You are glad you came on the day you did - it seems this fair is not to be
missed!

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

In the Bayou
  You walk carefully across the swampy ground of the bayou, trying to avoid
the many sinkholes and roots that lie hidden beneath the water.  Large
water-snakes slither away as you approach, and swarms of insects buzz about
your head.  A deep bog blocks the way to the east, but the ground looks
reasonably solid to the west, north and south.  

[ Exits: north south west ]

  You make your way through the thick mud of the bayou.  Wiping sweat from
your brow, you peer through the tangle of twisted mangrove trees looking for
a way out.  A large bog blocks the way to the south, but the way looks
passable to the north and west.  To the east you see a river flowing through
a clearing.

By the riverside
  A small river flows sluggishly through the bayou.  It twists and turns as
it runs from a break in the trees to the north, and away into the tangled
trees to the south.

  You are carried along by the flow of this dark muddy river.  Twisted

  You are carried along by the flow of the dark muddy waters.  Thick
tangles of mangrove trees prevent you from moving east or west, and by the
sound of churning water coming from the south, you guess that the river is
about to go over a waterfall!  Maybe you should make your way back upstream?

Over the waterfall!
  Ahhhhhhhh...  You are carried over the waterfall.  The powerful
downdraft of air and water sucks you down into a pool of water almost 100
feet down.  After a while you find yourself floating along the river which
has now grown larger after being joined by several other tributaries.  Steep
banks on either side of the river prevent you from going anywhere but south.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Entry Foyer
  You have entered the foyer of the Yurgach Fortress.  High stone walls
made from huge blocks of jet-black marble, and towering columns of mirror
black obsidian rise high into the darkness above.  You feel totally
insignificant and tiny, a mere speck of meaningless dust.  Dark corridors
lead off into long echoing chambers, and somewhere in the distance you hear
a horrible cry, as though someone had just had their soul ripped out!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Before the Wayward Alehouse
  Just off the path through the desolate pridelands of Abend, the dark 
continent, the only building within sight stands before you. The walls appear
to be constructed of a hardy wood, though they have not aged particularly 
well, and have several patches of weather-related damage throughout the 
visible section. The building is somewhat dark, though a steady hum of many 
intermixed noises can be heard through the walls. Directly in front of you is
a simple wooden door with a splintered surface and a dull grey doorknob.
Hanging above the door is a sign signifying what this building is. It's the 
Wayward Alehouse! The gravel path under you extends to the west and to the 
east.

  You are in the threshold of the Wayward Alehouse. The scent of smoke mixed 
with alcohol hits your nose as do the sights of this establishment. The floor
beneath you is entirely made of wood with no carpeting to speak of. Boots 
make quite a distinct thud when coming into contact with the old wood that 
makes up the floor of this building. Off to the east are the coat room and a 
staircase leading to the second floor. To the north, there the Alehouse 
extends, and you can see a bar off in the distance. The noise in here is 
quite elevated. Between the buzzing of conversation, the occasional battle 
cry, and a band off in the far corner playing "music," it can be difficult to
even hear one's own thoughts. To the west, a large open space with no tables 
or chairs to speak of.  The exit is back to the south.

to describe the scene before you. It is quite literally a wooden bench with a

Help Keywords : 'Vorpal Flag'.
Help Category : Equipment.

Last Updated  : 2010-05-11 22:33:42.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A vorpal weapon has a small chance of instantly decapitating an opponent
during a fight.  This is almost totally fatal; even the slightest nick of
further damage will surely kill a victim that has suffered a vorpal blow.  A
vorpalled opponent is treated as a regular kill for purposes of experience,
objects, and dying wishes, etc.

For those that hold a particular attachment to their head, there is a wish
that prevents vorpal blows from working on oneself- see 'help wishes'.

When you vorpal a target, their hit points are set to 1 and you must hit the
target again to kill it; you may (very rarely) see a miss after a vorpal
before the target dies.  The decapitation damage that appears with a vorpal
is cosmetic and does not represent regular weapon damage or the exact total
hit points remaining on the target.


"One, two! One, two! And through and through
  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
  He went galumphing back."   -Lewis Carroll, "Jabberwocky"

  It is quite smelly in here. The term "bathroom" is not entirely appropriate 
to describe the scene before you. It is quite literally a wooden bench with a
hole in it. This is, after all, where the patrons and guests of the Alehouse 
come to answer nature's call. The only obvious exit is to the east.

A room overlooking the horse pasture
  You stand in the so-called "premium suite" of the Wayward Alehouse. This is 
the owner's best attempt at providing a higher class room for his clients.
Really, it is the same as the other rooms, except with a view and perhaps 
cleaner sheets. There is no obvious light source aside from the windows, 
which seem to have actually been cleaned. A bed, small armoire, and wooden 
desk adorn the room making it moderately livable, if only for a day or two.

Coat (Armor) Check
  This is the coat room of the Wayward Alehouse. Patrons are encouraged to 
leave their unnecessary outer garments in this room for safekeeping while 
they enjoy the festivities of the bar area. "Coat" room is not entirely 
correct, as there are not many coats here, but rather pieces of armor.
Hanging on the walls, pieces of armor range from the simplest of hide tunics 
to steel breastplates, to horned battle helmets. There is a window giving a 
rather drab view of the path around the Alehouse. There is also a weapons 
rack, though it is oddly empty. A staircase extends northward to the second 
floor, and the only other obvious exit is back to the Alehouse proper.

In the threshold of the Alehouse
  You are in the threshold of the Wayward Alehouse. The scent of smoke mixed 
with alcohol hits your nose as do the sights of this establishment. The floor
beneath you is entirely made of wood with no carpeting to speak of. Boots 
make quite a distinct thud when coming into contact with the old wood that 
makes up the floor of this building. Off to the east are the coat room and a 
staircase leading to the second floor. To the north, there the Alehouse 
extends, and you can see a bar off in the distance. The noise in here is 
quite elevated. Between the buzzing of conversation, the occasional battle 
cry, and a band off in the far corner playing "music," it can be difficult to
even hear one's own thoughts. To the west, a large open space with no tables 
or chairs to speak of.  The exit is back to the south.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

  This set of rooms has even more people running every which way

  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron 
arrowheads and decorated with an iron worked coat of arms. To either side of 
the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

  To the south the large wrought iron gate clangs shut, the metallic sound 
resounding dully in your ears. To the north, an enormous bluestone manor sits
in the centre of a large estate. Just off to the side of the path is a guard 
house, where the gate guard can keep a watchful eye on the comings and goings
of the visitors to the estate. Sprawling green lawns, colourful flowerbeds 
and well-tended trees speak highly of the level of care which the 
groundskeeper injects into his chores.

  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to
the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and 
west a path made from small white stones seems to lead around the manor.

halfway along the hallway, double doors with glass panels show the room

lock. Considering the wealth on display in the manor, there must be treasured
items within. At the far end of the east wing are highly ornate double doors 
with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along
the entire length of the hallway. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles.

  A large feather bed nestles between a dresser and a study desk. A peach and 
white hand sewn quilt covers the bed and plump duck down pillows rest at the 
head of the bed. A tall mirror stands next to the wardrobe, which has been 
left open to reveal many dresses of various styles and colours. A plush white
wolf pelt lays on the floor next to the bed, its silky fur a delight for bare
feet. The window looks over a dark forest to the north and the estate's 
temple to the east. A flock of white birds flies by the window, their sudden,
noisy appearance a startling event.

  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

items within. At the far end of the east wing are highly ornate double doors 
with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along

  The ballroom is quite large, with long frosted glass windows along the walls.
Outside the windows some white swans are swimming on a pond which is 
surrounded by tulips. Looking up at the ceiling of the ballroom, you can see 
some floating chandeliers drifting slowly along, which twinkle like starlight
in the evening. There is a raised platform to one side of the room where 
musicians gather during events to provide the music for dancing. Potted 
plants and colourful flowers decorate the small niches along the walls, 
adding vibrancy to the room.

  The east wing of the manor has many doors along its length. To the north, 
halfway along the hallway, double doors with glass panels show the room 
within. A little further along is a door in the south wall with a large iron 
lock. Considering the wealth on display in the manor, there must be treasured
items within. At the far end of the east wing are highly ornate double doors 
with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along
the entire length of the hallway. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles.

  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each

staircase. On either side of the staircase, the red carpet flows on and 
through to the rest of the manor, passing long windows framed by thick velvet
curtains, that show the perfectly manicured gardens and lawns. Large 
tapestries of various fight scenes and hunting expeditions, frozen in time,

Aardington manor
  The foyer of the large bluestone manor is quite imposing. Everything in the 
manor speaks of wealth; old and timeless wealth. The floor is made from a 
white and black marble, inlaid with gold veins and specks. A deep, rich red 
carpet runner extends down the length of the main hall from the other side of
the foyer. Solid, polished wooden pedestals stand on either side of the front
doors, and hold a large antique vase each, which are many centuries old.
Long glass windows, framed by thick velvet curtains, allow plenty of 
sunlight to filter in. The occasional guard can be seen patrolling the

Before a temple
  The temple is made from the same stones that make up the manor itself. The 
temple is dedicated to Ayla, though it is open to all who seek peace and 
solitude. There are three low, flat bluestone steps leading up to the temple 
doors, which are made from a heavy wood and have large iron rings to open 
them outwards. On the walls either side of the door, ivy grows quite 
prolifically, the vines clinging to the stony surface.

behind glass, on pedestals to the left and right of the main doors. A white 
pillar candle, large enough to need three wicks, sits in each of the two 
arched niches, to the left and right of the inner temple door. Below each 
candle is a bronze plate, with offerings of gold and flowers, for the 
resident goddess, Ayla.

  There are many wooden pews in the temple to choose from for quiet prayer and

varied reasons, to pray to Ayla for comfort and peace. There is an old couple
sitting in the back row, their hands clasped tightly in each other's as they 
seek comfort in their time of prayer. There is a young lady, with a bunch of 
yellow daisies in her hand, weeping quietly towards the middle of the temple.

  This alcove is dedicated to the memory of those who have passed from the

creating a stable environment for the multitude of candles that have been 
placed here. A large box with a small slit at the top stands against the

A memorial alcove (1737)

Wooden pews
  At the front section of the pews you can see more of the temple. To the north
is a secluded alcove, with a wooden screen, which has been folded back 
against the wall, revealing two comfortable chairs. To the south is an alcove
with many candles burning in niches in the walls. To the north you can see 
the altar behind the pedestal, which is covered with fruit, flowers and 
plates of jewellery and gold. In the front pew is an old man, white beard 
flowing down his chest. He does not notice your presence, his eyes staring up
at the large tapestry of Ayla, hanging on the back wall, his lips moving 
ceaselessly in a never ending prayer to the goddess.

  There are many wooden pews in the temple to choose from for quiet prayer and 
reflection. Some of these pews have occupants, who have come for their own 
varied reasons, to pray to Ayla for comfort and peace. There is an old couple
sitting in the back row, their hands clasped tightly in each other's as they 
seek comfort in their time of prayer. There is a young lady, with a bunch of 
yellow daisies in her hand, weeping quietly towards the middle of the temple.
At the far end is a raised dais, upon which a large book sits on a simple

  The foyer of the temple is cool and dim, allowing you to reflect on your time
here, whether coming or going. There are some ancient scrolls, situated 
behind glass, on pedestals to the left and right of the main doors. A white 
pillar candle, large enough to need three wicks, sits in each of the two 
arched niches, to the left and right of the inner temple door. Below each 
candle is a bronze plate, with offerings of gold and flowers, for the 
resident goddess, Ayla.

  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to
the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and 
west a path made from small white stones seems to lead around the manor.

  The east wing of the manor has many doors along its length. To the north, 
halfway along the hallway, double doors with glass panels show the room 
within. A little further along is a door in the south wall with a large iron 
lock. Considering the wealth on display in the manor, there must be treasured
items within. At the far end of the east wing are highly ornate double doors 
with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along
the entire length of the hallway. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles.

Outside the windows some white swans are swimming on a pond which is 
surrounded by tulips. Looking up at the ceiling of the ballroom, you can see 
some floating chandeliers drifting slowly along, which twinkle like starlight
in the evening. There is a raised platform to one side of the room where 
musicians gather during events to provide the music for dancing. Potted 
plants and colourful flowers decorate the small niches along the walls, 
adding vibrancy to the room.

halfway along the hallway, double doors with glass panels show the room 
within. A little further along is a door in the south wall with a large iron

with frosted glass panelling. There are many niches in the walls, which 
display antiques from all over Andolor. Vases of flowers are seated on highly
polished wooden pedestals, and tapestries and paintings adorn the walls along

Grand hall (1738)

West wing
  There are many doors along the hallway of the west wing of the manor. One 
wooden door to the north is slightly ajar and a wisp of smoke emerges from 
the room within, carrying with it the scent of tobacco. There is a large set 
of double doors in the south wall that catches your attention and is probably
worth a closer look. At the far end of the hallway is a single door that has 
carvings of roses in the panelling. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles, which are never allowed to burn out. Small tables 
adorned with vases and figurines are placed between the doors along the walls.
Paintings and tapestries adorn the walls above the small tables and their
artwork.

  This room surely belongs to the women of the house. The room is bright and 
airy and a garden of flowers grows under the windows, lending their mixed 
perfume to the room within through the open window. There are a few 
comfortable chairs, a low couch and a table with some wooden chairs that 
occupy the room. There is a fireplace in the south wall with a tapestry 
hanging above it. Needlework lies heaped in small piles on the table, waiting
to be worked on again. A spinning wheel stands in one corner, which has been 
worn dull and smooth from so much use over the years. A small table sits in 
between two of the armchairs with a steaming fresh pot of tea and two teacups
and saucers.

>>    Walk of the Stars - Vespera
  Crimson light, like the ruddy hue of an unseen sunset, winds around these
stars.  And yet, unlike the Zenith trail, it does not seem malevolent, but
restful.  The path it takes runs from Kitalpha, past the moongate, then
north, parallel to Moonwalk until it reaches Kursa, and goes around Sham and
Tseen Kee on its way to Okda, and finally south to complete the loop. 
Kitalpha is directly south of here and Scheat is to the northeast, while
Novus Ordo is in the northeast, across the Antipodal Celestial Meridian.

Entrance to the Warcamp
  The gates to the warcamp have been left open, and the guardposts have been 
deserted. There is virtually no traffic on the west side of the camp. Even 
the fortifications are in disrepair. The sounds of weapons being forged and 
recruits being yelled at break up the sounds of the forest to the west. The 
castle looms high above the camp, yet the camp is still safely protected by 
distance. It is not just the damage to the walls, there is something 
other-worldly about the castle to the east.

Certain classes have the ability to slow down their metabolism without
affecting combat and regeneration ability. This allows them to spend more
time out in the wild without needing to carry large amounts of supplies.

The speed at which a player becomes hungry/thirsty is more than halved while
under the effects of this spell.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

  The cavern seems to be getting darker and you slow down a little to let
your eyes adjust to the darkness.  The darkness is getting to you and you
start to panic!!  While frantically looking for a way out, you feel the
breeze brush your cheek.  There must be an exit nearby.

(Hidden) (Red Aura) A small bat stares at you with glowing eyes here.
(Invis) (Hidden) (Golden Aura) An Aylor Expeditionary Force scout creeps about trying not to be seen
here.
You no longer absorb magical attacks.

Underground Valley
  The light at the end of the tunnel!!  You feel so relieved after being
cramped up in the caverns.  You must be getting closer to the Citadel.  From
a distance, you can hear the warcries and clashing of swords..  Turning your
head towards the sounds, you come upon a small valley that has been burned
down by fighting.  You step closer to the burning bushes and trees and
hear the sounds grow stronger.  You must be close to the battlefield!

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

Before the Fabled City
  The City of Stone looms ahead of you.  The towering stone monuments of
the city contrast with the luscious green of your immediate surroundings.  It
appears majestic, the simple curves of the stone buildings reflect the
sunset slightly, creating an almost eerie feeling.  From this distance you
can't see any movement or life inside the city.  Wondering if the city will
be as quiet and serene inside its walls as it appears from here, you
continue on your journey.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

Deep Jungle
  The jungle is much darker here than to the north.  The vegetation is no
longer shades of vivid green, but rather those of brown and red.  The trees
are thin and oddly angled.  Vines that once hung loosely from the branches
of these trees now wrap around them in a parasitic embrace.  Noxious fumes
from nearby tar pools permeate the air.  Animals tend to avoid this part of
the jungle because they will find no sustenance here.  There is a wide hole
in the underbrush here covered in the usual litter of decay.

  The light at the end of the tunnel!!  You feel so relieved after being
cramped up in the caverns.  You must be getting closer to the Citadel.  From
a distance, you can hear the warcries and clashing of swords..  Turning your
head towards the sounds, you come upon a small valley that has been burned
down by fighting.  You step closer to the burning bushes and trees and
hear the sounds grow stronger.  You must be close to the battlefield!

Within the Dark Forest
  You suddenly find yourself in a different part of the forest.  It is a
lot darker and quieter here, even the trees seem wider and more foreboding. 
Everything has strange feel to it, from the small pebble that you just
stepped on to some rustling branches that startled you.  You feel an eerie
sense of having stumbled upon an unmapped sector of the forest.  A faint
murmur catches your attention, it seemed to come from the north.  Looking
closely you notice a small path has now revealed itself.  You follow it
cautiously, keeping a close eye on your surroundings.  Your heart begins to
beat faster and faster as you approach the end and discover a well hidden
cave.  You are scared yet incredibly curious as to what's inside, and decide
to continue on slowly..

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Linear A
  Futhark the Elder, in ages past, wrote many things upon the sky so that
he would never be far from his spellbooks, or indeed the rest of his
library.  Unlike Linear B, which is mostly comprehensible, Linear A is a
complete mystery to anyone but Futhark, who is long dead.  A single rune is
visible here, glowing red.

Maia (G)
  Also called the Archivist's Star, it is thought that an ancient library
from ages past was relocated here during the Cataclysm.  Though now safe
from the Demonlord's rampage, it is unknown whether it will ever be
reopened.  Because of the danger, the spells protecting the archive make it
so that it can only be opened from the inside.  Given that the Cataclysm is
long over, many fear that all inside it have simply perished, and that it
will be lost forever.  And yet, others hope that they are merely being
overly cautious, pointing out that some could have survived, as it were, by
becoming undead.

  This luminous reservoir of ink was created by the Wizard of Holtzman,
Guilielmus Xylander, who assisted Futhark the Elder before Rorschach did. 
Created to aid in the construction of Linear A, it once contained far more
ink, but the ink was used up far more quickly than expected, being drawn to
the star Maia before most of it could be used.  This is what led Futhark the
Elder to later create Linear B.  Some amuse themselves here by finding
shapes in the blobs of ink.  One of the blobs here looks like a goat eating
a pillow.

  This shining, golden path across the heavens appears to be formed from
the light of Canopus by the nearby desert planet.  It is no doubt a form of
solar energy converted by the pool of light which that world gathers from
the Moonwalk.  The trail flows south from there, across the Celestial

Before the Keep
  A towering wall stands here. It is composed of large stone blocks that 
form a wall that extends for about 50 yards in each direction before the 
walls turn to the north. The wall stretches far up above you, and is topped 
with jagged, razor-sharp pieces of metal. The only way into the keep is 
through the wooden gate to the north.

[ Exits: (north) down ]
A tall, strange man stands here waiting in the shadows.
Galkorum asks, "Hello my friend. Would you be interested in helping me to
 release some unjustly imprisoned friends of mine?"
 
Galkorum says, "If you are willing to help me, then not only will you be
 freeing those that have been unjustly imprisoned by those sanctimonious
 keepers, but you would also be able to have access to the items and jewels
 that these keepers have kept to themselves for millennia."
 
Galkorum asks, "So what do you say, are you willing to free some unjustly
 accused prisoners and make yourself rich at the same time?"

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron 
arrowheads and decorated with an iron worked coat of arms. To either side of 
the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

The stables
  A cacophony of animal sounds is coming from a large wooden building, whose 
doors are flung wide open. This is quite obviously the Earl's stables, which 
houses a wondrous variety of creatures, some of which he uses as steeds and 
others which he keeps as work animals or living trophies. The Earl's staff 
are busy looking after the animals, feeding them and mucking out the stalls.

[ Exits: south up ]
A proud griffon rests quietly in his stall.
(Golden Aura) A strong, young man is tending to the animals quite diligently.

The hayloft
  This is a large hayloft where most of the hay is stored. Off to one side 
there is some bedding where the stable hands sleep at night, so they can take
turns to keep a watchful eye on the Earl's prized pets. From this vantage 
point you can see into every stall, all of which are filled with fresh hay.
The smell of the animals is rather cloying up here as the stables are kept 
heated for the comfort of the animals.

[ Exits: down ]
     (Magic) In the corner of the hayloft is some canvas bedding.
(Hidden) A rustling in the hay indicates the presence of rodents.
(Hidden) (Golden Aura) A barn owl hoots at you from the shadowy rafters. [QUEST]

various other important people get to sit to watch the tournament.  From
here you have a perfect view of the action going on down in the arena.  The
box has recently been repainted, and looks straight into the arena, close
enough that the competitors' expressions can be discerned.  Royal tapestries
of Illoria adorn the walls, and servers come and go, bringing the Royal
Family food.  Looking down, you think you see something moving below the
floorboards, but decide that it must be your overactive imagination.

The Gold Knight's Tent
  You stand in yet another knight's tent.  The owner of this tent obviously
has some experience being a ranger.  You see preserved skins hanging all
over the entire tent, and the tent itself seems to be made of the skin of
some animal as well.  The aroma of all the skins is actually quite pleasant.
You consider staying and conversing with the knight.  Is there enough time
before the tournament starts?

  You are in the bar of a small inn.  Various people from the fair are here
to be refreshed in between rounds of fair-going, shopping, and
battle-watching.  You note that several of the knights seem to be enjoying
themselves here as well.  Perhaps there is something to the food and drink
here?  You chuckle to yourself, shake your head, and move to mingle with the
crowd.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Syntax:  cast 'gate' <target>
Spell Number: 50

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal
between your character and another living target somewhere else in the 
world.  Private and no-recall rooms may not be gated into, and you may not
leave a no-recall room via the gate spell.

Additionally, attempting to cast this spell towards monsters which are
sufficiently more powerful than you, any player level 200 or higher, and 
any player with nosummon on, will fail.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand before a large wrought iron gate which is tipped with iron 
arrowheads and decorated with an iron worked coat of arms. To either side of 
the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

Before the manor
  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to
the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and 
west a path made from small white stones seems to lead around the manor.

West wing
  There are many doors along the hallway of the west wing of the manor. One 
wooden door to the north is slightly ajar and a wisp of smoke emerges from 
the room within, carrying with it the scent of tobacco. There is a large set 
of double doors in the south wall that catches your attention and is probably
worth a closer look. At the far end of the hallway is a single door that has 
carvings of roses in the panelling. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles, which are never allowed to burn out. Small tables 
adorned with vases and figurines are placed between the doors along the walls.
Paintings and tapestries adorn the walls above the small tables and their
artwork.

  This room surely belongs to the women of the house. The room is bright and 
airy and a garden of flowers grows under the windows, lending their mixed 
perfume to the room within through the open window. There are a few 
comfortable chairs, a low couch and a table with some wooden chairs that 
occupy the room. There is a fireplace in the south wall with a tapestry 
hanging above it. Needlework lies heaped in small piles on the table, waiting
to be worked on again. A spinning wheel stands in one corner, which has been 
worn dull and smooth from so much use over the years. A small table sits in 
between two of the armchairs with a steaming fresh pot of tea and two teacups
and saucers.

  You stand in a desolated part of the training grounds.  Around you, all
hell has broken loose, but none of the beasts or trolls comes closer.  You
lean on your shield to rest for a while before returning to the fights,
south and west from you.

The Military Training Grounds
  With your back against the northern wall, and a pile of dead bodies at
your feet, you face yet another wave of foes to fight.  From here, you can
pull back towards a somewhat quieter part east of here, go south to examine
the big obelisk more closely, or go west.

The Military Training Grounds
  You stand in the middle of the training grounds.  Here the duels seem to
be the hardest and the creatures the toughest.  Exactly in the middle, you
see a huge stone pillar with a chain attached to its top, so big and heavy
that no creature in Aylor should be able to break it, or even drag it one
inch.  A group of trolls forms a circle around the pillar with their swords
drawn and their spears aimed.

  Fighting through the hordes of creatures which are released as
practice targets for the trolls, you have reached the east part of the
training grounds.  From here you can go south, to the source of the
creatures you just encountered, west to a giant obelisk or north to a
relatively quiet part of the area.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"

say castle


You say 'castle'
Outside the throne room
  You have greatly enjoyed your journey through Sargasso, the underworld,
and this mysterious town/castle, but now all that is behind you.  You stand
in front of the diamond door to the throne room, where you can at last meet
Queen Angelina, whose grace and wisdom you have heard much about.  Your heart
starts to race with excitement, and you want to tear down the door just so
you can see her more quickly.  You will yourself to calm down however, and
take time out to think of what you will say to her.  As you ponder this
important question, you admire the statues of the queen that guard the
throne room like angels of eternity.  They were sculpted from pure diamond,
but their eyes are aquamarine, their staves sapphires, their halos topaz, and
their fingernails rubies.  Its almost as if Queen Angelina summoned the
powers from all corners of her realm to protect her throne room from hatred
and destruction.  Taking a deep breath, you finally realize what you will
say to her and decide to open the door.

Inside Diamond Castle (1856)

Inside Diamond Castle
  Two tapestries woven of pure silken threads grace the diamond walls of
the hallway, each depicting a turning point of not just the castle, but of
the whole city as well.  Crystalline suits of armor line the walls,
absorbing the light then dispersing it in a prismatic spiral.  The
chandelier hanging from the ceiling has no candles with which to
illuminate the corridor, yet it gives off a tranquil radiance which urges
you to release all your pent up hatreds and phobias.  Your eyelids slowly
drift downwards as you fall into a deep healing trance.  Here, above all
other places, you feel safe.

  After opening the diamond gate and entering the castle, your senses are
overcome with amazement and wonder.  Even the inner walls of this
magnificent castle are made of diamond.  As you step across the floor, the
shock of your feet smacking the ground is absorbed, and instead of making a
cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which
separates the rest of the castle from the arborium, and to the south is the
castle dining room.  The castle hallway continues east.

Inside the dining room
  The long rectangular table of Diamond Castle's dining room continues
here.  The large, plush red chairs indicate to you that this corner of the
room is designated for the most wealthy and most honored guests.  These
people smile in a very fake way, acknowledge your presence, then turn around
and continue their mindless babbling.  Talk about your stuffy nobility!  You
might as well leave these pompous morons to their own devices, as nobility
can bring nothing but trouble.  Muttering something about their lineage
under your breath, you leave their part of the table.  You didn't want their
cruddy old food anyway.  The dining room continues north and east, while the
kitchen is down below.

  This place was formed during the martyrdom of St. Vesper when he faced
down a great demon to save his parish.  He managed to lure the demon away
from the people and over to a small shrine in the countryside where he
invoked its power to destroy the demon.  Unfortunately, the demon had at
that same moment unleashed an abyssal force to murder the priest.  St. 
Vesper thus became a martyr, the demon was sent back to hell, and various
remains of the shrine were thrown so violently into the sky that they wound
up here, not far from Absolvo Te, the Mercy Star, which they were surely
drawn to.  A burse, missing its corporal, floats here.

Imperial Guard's Barracks
  You are standing in the barracks of the Imperial Guard. The room is filled 
with bunk beds. A small table has been set up in the corner of the room, and a
scattered deck of cards lies there. Small lockers sit under the beds, but are
locked tight. The room looks like it has been cleaned recently as there isn't
a speck of dust to be seen.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

The Beach
  You see a beautiful tropical beach.  Exotic birds sing in melody.  To the
east is a small shack with a faded sign.  To the west is a hut made of logs
and sticks.  North lies what looks like a stone age village.  You scuffle
the sand and see a depression.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A dark forest
  Wandering through the forest was a bad idea. Not only is it cold and wet, but
also unnaturally dark. Regardless of the time of day, the forest stays the 
same brightness. Even the sounds of the forest have been muffled by some 
unseen force. The remains of an animal trail loop and twist around, 
eventually extending out of sight.

(Golden Aura) The eldar hermit skillfully navigates the forest.
(Hidden) (Golden Aura) (White Aura) An unusually large firefly is here, and it appears to be
watching you.
(Red Aura) A kobold shaman hides in the underbrush, waiting for an ally.
 
As you enter, you see a kobold dive into some bushes and wait for you to leave.

Entrance to the Warcamp (1774)

A path through the camp
  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. The camp runs from the north to the south, 
with tents all along the main path. Unlike the western gates to the camp, the
eastern gate has been well-maintained and is under constant guard. The path 
leading east out of the camp is almost as worn as the main path. The only 
permanent structure, a one-room building made of wood and clay, lies to the 
west.

A path through the camp
  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. The camp runs from the north to the south, 
with camps all along the main path. This seems to be a main thoroughfare for 
traveling from the north and south ends of the camp. A massive battering ram 
is being constructed to the west, while the deafening sound of soldiers is 
coming from the south.

  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. The path splits here, one less-used path 
continuing south and another to the east. The sounds of soldiers move from 
the south to the east as two large tents can be seen to the south. The 
soldiers' barracks and sparring arena to the east are swarming with kobolds, 
many of them armed and armored.

  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. To the south, a large red tent has been 
masterfully erected; the massive poles holding up the thick fabric seem 
immovable. A less impressive yellow tent lies to the west. The southern end 
of the battlements are thickest here, and wrap around the south end of the 
tent, continuing west where the forest offers adequate cover from attack.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

From here you can see the valley, although it looks far away. An unnatural 
object floats above you, while there is only empty space below you. Several 
glyphs are enscribed on the object, and you cannot see the other end of it.

Landing platform
  You are standing on a large platform above the clouds. The platform is made 
from some sort of wood, and is a simple circular shape. The only thing you 
can see below are clouds. To the north, you see a road. The road continues up
to a huge floating building.

An aerial street
  This aerial pathway continues to the north and south. Hawklords climb onto 
air currents and fly down the street, zipping by you. Bird cries echo in your
ears, as birds of prey swoop from the sky towards the earth. Children float 
on the air and play games. Several attack each other with swords, while 
others defend themselves with tridents. A small building floats below you, 
and there are large buildings to the east and west.

A small dwelling
  You are standing in a small home of a hawklord family who moved out of the 
housing units, or perhaps they were kicked out. Due to the close nature of 
the hawklords, it is rare for a family to move out by themselves. However 
this family has kept the small house in tight shape. Similar to the housing 
units, there are bunk beds in a row with trunks in front of the bed. A large 
dresser sits alongside the east wall, and a kitchen area is in the southwest 
corner. A few pictures hang on the wall.

     A small play dagger lies here.

Stone gates along the path
  The path is blocked by huge stone gates. Through the gates, you see an 
overlook. In front of the gates, several guards are kneeling on the ground.
They appear human, but have huge wings on their backs. A small campfire with 
some cooking meat crackles nearby.

  You are standing on an overlook which looks over the entire valley. A large 
shadow passes overhead, and you look up and see a flying man. The drop off 
from the plateau is severe, and looks like a quick exit from this life.
