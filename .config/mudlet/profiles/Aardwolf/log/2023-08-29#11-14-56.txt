  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

       Zyian : Discover What the Cult Under the Well Is Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 3  : Talk to the Statues

Thalien says, "I was trying to pick these flowers for Sarah when these people
came through a door in the well and kidnapped me." 

Thalien says, "Life was dismal after that because they barely fed me and 
even the water was scarce." 

Thalien says, "I did learn that they are part of some kind of cult that 
worships someone called Zyian." 

Thalien says, "Something strange did happen while I was here that I think 
I should tell you about." 

Thalien says, "As I was walking past these statues, I heard a voice whisper 
that I shouldn't lose hope."

 Thalien says, "Maybe you should find them and see what you can find 
out about these cultists." 

The statues talk about how this was once a peaceful temple devoted to 
improving the lives of its members. They also say that a cult leader called 
Zyian move in and either killed or converted the members of the temple. They 
need you to end his evil plans and stop him by any means necessary.

Task 4  : Mercy Quest - Free the Elves!

The Statue of Mercy says, "Somewhere in this temple, a cruel woman is 
torturing some elves." 
The Statue of Mercy says, "Release an elf from their pain, and end 
this cruel woman's sadistic ways." 
The Statue of Mercy says,"I will know when you have accomplished this,
but you also will have to complete the tasks that the other statues 
request before we can tell you what else we know." 

Task 6  : Knowledge Quest - Return the Book

The Statue of Knowledge says, "But before we can continue, I need you to
prove to me that you understand the meaning of knowledge."

The Statue of Knowledge says, "Somewhere in this temple, a black mage
called Nyruk has a book of earth magic that he will use to devastate
nearby towns. "

The Statue of Knowledge says, "Stop his evil plans and bring the book to
me."

The Statue of Knowledge says, "You also will have to complete the tasks
that the other statues request before we can tell you what else we know."

Task 7  : Wealth Quest - Return the Gem

The Statue of Wealth says, "But before we can continue, I need you to
prove to me that you understand the value of wealth."

The Statue of Wealth says, "Somewhere in this temple, a creature 
called Foulspawn has a gem that was taken from my statue. " 

The Statue of Wealth says, "Show that you understand wealth by 
returning the gem to me." 

The Statue of Wealth says, "You also will have to complete 
the tasks that the other statues request before we can tell you what else
we know."

Task 8  : Fame Quest - Stop the Golem Maker

The Statue of Fame says, "But before we can continue, I need you to prove
to me that you have the courage to be famous."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 3  : Talk to the Statues

Thalien says, "I was trying to pick these flowers for Sarah when these people
came through a door in the well and kidnapped me." 

Thalien says, "Life was dismal after that because they barely fed me and 
even the water was scarce." 

Thalien says, "I did learn that they are part of some kind of cult that 
worships someone called Zyian." 

Thalien says, "Something strange did happen while I was here that I think 
I should tell you about." 

Thalien says, "As I was walking past these statues, I heard a voice whisper 
that I shouldn't lose hope."

 Thalien says, "Maybe you should find them and see what you can find 
out about these cultists." 

The statues talk about how this was once a peaceful temple devoted to 
improving the lives of its members. They also say that a cult leader called 
Zyian move in and either killed or converted the members of the temple. They 
need you to end his evil plans and stop him by any means necessary.

Task 6  : Return to the Statue of Mercy

An image of the statue of mercy appears before you and reminds you that you 
still need to return to the statue.

Task 7  : Knowledge Quest - Return the Book

The Statue of Knowledge says, "But before we can continue, I need you to
prove to me that you understand the meaning of knowledge."

The Statue of Knowledge says, "Somewhere in this temple, a black mage
called Nyruk has a book of earth magic that he will use to devastate
nearby towns. "

The Statue of Knowledge says, "Stop his evil plans and bring the book to
me."

The Statue of Knowledge says, "You also will have to complete the tasks
that the other statues request before we can tell you what else we know."

Task 8  : Wealth Quest - Return the Gem

The Statue of Wealth says, "But before we can continue, I need you to
prove to me that you understand the value of wealth."

called Foulspawn has a gem that was taken from my statue. " 

The Statue of Wealth says, "Show that you understand wealth by 
returning the gem to me." 

The Statue of Wealth says, "You also will have to complete 
the tasks that the other statues request before we can tell you what else
we know."

Task 9  : Fame Quest - Stop the Golem Maker

The Statue of Fame says, "But before we can continue, I need you to prove
to me that you have the courage to be famous."

The Statue of Fame says, "Somewhere in this temple, a cruel man called
Berun is creating golems from the body parts of involuntary donors."

The Statue of Fame says, "Prove that you have the courage to be famous by
killing any 3 body parts, killing a golem, and killing Berun himself."

The Statue of Fame says, "I will know when you have accomplished this, but
you will still need to return to me, and you also will have to complete
the tasks that the other statues request before we can tell you what else
we know."

Task 10 : Kill Berun

The Statue of Fame says, "Prove that you have the courage to be famous by 
killing Berun, the Golem Maker."

  The shelves of the library hold many different types of books and are

the books seem to contain knowledge of battle.  To the south, a book of

can't help but feel that what is behind the door will rely on the knowledge
learnt from the books that surround it.

another book floats from a shelf and into his hand. He barely takes the time

Task 3  : Talk to the Statues

came through a door in the well and kidnapped me." 

Thalien says, "Life was dismal after that because they barely fed me and 
even the water was scarce." 

Thalien says, "I did learn that they are part of some kind of cult that 
worships someone called Zyian." 

Thalien says, "Something strange did happen while I was here that I think 
I should tell you about." 

Thalien says, "As I was walking past these statues, I heard a voice whisper 
that I shouldn't lose hope."

 Thalien says, "Maybe you should find them and see what you can find 
out about these cultists." 

The statues talk about how this was once a peaceful temple devoted to 
improving the lives of its members. They also say that a cult leader called 
Zyian move in and either killed or converted the members of the temple. They 
need you to end his evil plans and stop him by any means necessary.

The Statue of Wealth says, "Show that you understand wealth by 
returning the gem to me." 

The Statue of Wealth says, "You also will have to complete 
the tasks that the other statues request before we can tell you what else
we know."

Task 11 : Fame Quest - Stop the Golem Maker

The Statue of Fame says, "But before we can continue, I need you to prove
to me that you have the courage to be famous."

The Statue of Fame says, "Somewhere in this temple, a cruel man called
Berun is creating golems from the body parts of involuntary donors."

The Statue of Fame says, "Prove that you have the courage to be famous by
killing any 3 body parts, killing a golem, and killing Berun himself."

The Statue of Fame says, "I will know when you have accomplished this, but
you will still need to return to me, and you also will have to complete
the tasks that the other statues request before we can tell you what else
we know."

Task 12 : Kill Berun

The Statue of Fame says, "Prove that you have the courage to be famous by

Before the Temple
{coords}3,12,28
{rdesc}
  As you pass the trial, the southern door opens to you and leads you out
in front of this large temple.  It is carved almost entirely out of white
marble, and contains many beautifully crafted stained glass windows.  Many
are showing acts of love, friendship and mercy.  The doors to the cathedral
are very large, and made mostly out of wood.  They have long bands of iron,
which are nailed to the planks, keeping the door in one piece.

dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the

A Narrow Tunnel
  As you go through the small opening, you find a very small tunnel carved into
the stone. The tunnel leads to the south. As you peer down the tunnel, you 
can just barely make out sounds of screaming, and the light of torches. It 
appears that you might be able to squeeze though.

worships someone called Zyian." 

Thalien says, "Something strange did happen while I was here that I think 
I should tell you about." 

Thalien says, "As I was walking past these statues, I heard a voice whisper 
that I shouldn't lose hope."

 Thalien says, "Maybe you should find them and see what you can find 
out about these cultists." 

The statues talk about how this was once a peaceful temple devoted to 
improving the lives of its members. They also say that a cult leader called 
Zyian move in and either killed or converted the members of the temple. They 
need you to end his evil plans and stop him by any means necessary.

killing any 3 body parts, killing a golem, and killing Berun himself."

  After lowering yourself down the well for what seems to be an eternity,
you finally reach the bottom of the well.  As you let go of the rope and
land on the well floor, you can see that Sarah was right, the well is bone
dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the

boulder, which appears to be blocking the way of a rather large hole.

Task 3  : Talk to the Statues

Thalien says, "I was trying to pick these flowers for Sarah when these people
came through a door in the well and kidnapped me." 

Thalien says, "Life was dismal after that because they barely fed me and 
even the water was scarce." 

Thalien says, "I did learn that they are part of some kind of cult that 
worships someone called Zyian." 

Thalien says, "Something strange did happen while I was here that I think 
I should tell you about." 

Thalien says, "As I was walking past these statues, I heard a voice whisper 
that I shouldn't lose hope."

 Thalien says, "Maybe you should find them and see what you can find 
out about these cultists." 

The statues talk about how this was once a peaceful temple devoted to 
improving the lives of its members. They also say that a cult leader called 
Zyian move in and either killed or converted the members of the temple. They 
need you to end his evil plans and stop him by any means necessary.

Task 6  : Return to the Statue of Mercy

An image of the statue of mercy appears before you and reminds you that you 
still need to return to the statue.

prove to me that you understand the meaning of knowledge."

The Statue of Knowledge says, "Somewhere in this temple, a black mage
called Nyruk has a book of earth magic that he will use to devastate
nearby towns. "

called Foulspawn has a gem that was taken from my statue. " 

The Statue of Wealth says, "Show that you understand wealth by 
returning the gem to me." 

The Statue of Wealth says, "You also will have to complete 
the tasks that the other statues request before we can tell you what else
we know."

Task 12 : Fame Quest - Stop the Golem Maker

The Statue of Fame says, "But before we can continue, I need you to prove
to me that you have the courage to be famous."

The Statue of Fame says, "Somewhere in this temple, a cruel man called
Berun is creating golems from the body parts of involuntary donors."

The Statue of Fame says, "Prove that you have the courage to be famous by
killing any 3 body parts, killing a golem, and killing Berun himself."

The Statue of Fame says, "I will know when you have accomplished this, but
you will still need to return to me, and you also will have to complete
the tasks that the other statues request before we can tell you what else
we know."

Task 13 : Kill Berun

Task 3  : Talk to the Statues

Thalien says, "I was trying to pick these flowers for Sarah when these people

even the water was scarce." 

Thalien says, "I did learn that they are part of some kind of cult that 
worships someone called Zyian." 

Thalien says, "Something strange did happen while I was here that I think 
I should tell you about." 

Thalien says, "As I was walking past these statues, I heard a voice whisper 
that I shouldn't lose hope."

 Thalien says, "Maybe you should find them and see what you can find 
out about these cultists." 

The statues talk about how this was once a peaceful temple devoted to 
improving the lives of its members. They also say that a cult leader called 
Zyian move in and either killed or converted the members of the temple. They 
need you to end his evil plans and stop him by any means necessary.

we know."

Task 13 : Fame Quest - Stop the Golem Maker

The Statue of Fame says, "But before we can continue, I need you to prove
to me that you have the courage to be famous."

The Statue of Fame says, "Somewhere in this temple, a cruel man called
Berun is creating golems from the body parts of involuntary donors."

The Statue of Fame says, "Prove that you have the courage to be famous by
killing any 3 body parts, killing a golem, and killing Berun himself."

The Statue of Fame says, "I will know when you have accomplished this, but
you will still need to return to me, and you also will have to complete

we know."

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Dank and dark are these caves. You notice that water sheets down the wall in 
some areas of this cave, giving the cavern an almost mirror-like surface. As 
you venture forward, you come across a corpse of a Elf, hacked to bits and 
half eaten by the insects that inhabit the caverns. Perhaps this would be a 
good time to find your way out of here...

  As you continue to follow one of the caverns, it brings you to a rather large

  Parts of bodies lie in a heap here. Some of the body parts are rotting, while
other are merely smashed beyond recognition. A lone man works feverishly on 
what appears to be a golem made entirely out of flesh. As he turns, he looks

we know."

The Golem Factory
  Parts of bodies lie in a heap here. Some of the body parts are rotting, while
other are merely smashed beyond recognition. A lone man works feverishly on 
what appears to be a golem made entirely out of flesh. As he turns, he looks 
at at you. After giving your body a look, he mumbles, "no no, that won't do".
He then ignores you and goes back to working on his golem.

(Red Aura) An Imp flies here, performing minor tasks for its master.
A Flesh Golem stands here, guarding the creator.

  The stench of rotting flesh is almost too much to bear in this room. 
Corpses of animals and elves hang from large meat hooks, lining the walls as

even the water was scarce." 

Thalien says, "I did learn that they are part of some kind of cult that 
worships someone called Zyian." 

Thalien says, "Something strange did happen while I was here that I think 
I should tell you about." 

Thalien says, "As I was walking past these statues, I heard a voice whisper 
that I shouldn't lose hope."

 Thalien says, "Maybe you should find them and see what you can find 
out about these cultists." 

The statues talk about how this was once a peaceful temple devoted to 
improving the lives of its members. They also say that a cult leader called 
Zyian move in and either killed or converted the members of the temple. They 
need you to end his evil plans and stop him by any means necessary.

killing any 3 body parts, killing a golem, and killing Berun himself."

The Golem Factory
  Parts of bodies lie in a heap here. Some of the body parts are rotting, while
other are merely smashed beyond recognition. A lone man works feverishly on 
what appears to be a golem made entirely out of flesh. As he turns, he looks 
at at you. After giving your body a look, he mumbles, "no no, that won't do".
He then ignores you and goes back to working on his golem.

A Gravel Path (2151)

The Mess Hall
  The mess hall could not have been more appropriately named, as the soldiers 
break furniture, throw food, and brawl over petty arguments. As the officers 
enter the room and sit to eat, the rabble dies down. The soldiers are hoping 
that the officers won't cut their supply of wine off.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  After lowering yourself down the well for what seems to be an eternity,
you finally reach the bottom of the well.  As you let go of the rope and
land on the well floor, you can see that Sarah was right, the well is bone
dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the
well.  Perhaps these are where the water came from.  To the east, is a small
boulder, which appears to be blocking the way of a rather large hole.

Searching the Caverns... [**> PK <**]
  Dank and dark are these caves. You notice that water sheets down the wall in 
some areas of this cave, giving the cavern an almost mirror-like surface. As 
you venture forward, you come across a corpse of a Elf, hacked to bits and 
half eaten by the insects that inhabit the caverns. Perhaps this would be a 
good time to find your way out of here...

the books seem to contain knowledge of battle.  To the south, a book of
spells.  Each side of the library also has a large wooden door, and you
can't help but feel that what is behind the door will rely on the knowledge
learnt from the books that surround it.

Before the Temple
  As you pass the trial, the southern door opens to you and leads you out
in front of this large temple.  It is carved almost entirely out of white
marble, and contains many beautifully crafted stained glass windows.  Many
are showing acts of love, friendship and mercy.  The doors to the cathedral
are very large, and made mostly out of wood.  They have long bands of iron,
which are nailed to the planks, keeping the door in one piece.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

  This once large trail has now been reclaimed by the wild grass that grows
to either side of it.  Only cows keep the trail alive, by walking and
grazing.  The trail leads north to a small farm.

Sarah's Farm (2169)

A Small Well... (2168)

At The Bottom Of The Well
  After lowering yourself down the well for what seems to be an eternity,
you finally reach the bottom of the well.  As you let go of the rope and
land on the well floor, you can see that Sarah was right, the well is bone
dry.  As you look around, you can see many small holes in the wall of the
well.  Perhaps these are where the water came from.  To the east, is a small
boulder, which appears to be blocking the way of a rather large hole.

Searching the Caverns... [**> PK <**]
  Dank and dark are these caves. You notice that water sheets down the wall in 
some areas of this cave, giving the cavern an almost mirror-like surface. As 
you venture forward, you come across a corpse of a Elf, hacked to bits and 
half eaten by the insects that inhabit the caverns. Perhaps this would be a 
good time to find your way out of here...

  The shelves of the library hold many different types of books and are
quite tall, easily reaching a height of two or three stories.  To the west,
the books seem to contain knowledge of battle.  To the south, a book of
spells.  Each side of the library also has a large wooden door, and you
can't help but feel that what is behind the door will rely on the knowledge
learnt from the books that surround it.

Before the Temple
  As you pass the trial, the southern door opens to you and leads you out
in front of this large temple.  It is carved almost entirely out of white
marble, and contains many beautifully crafted stained glass windows.  Many
are showing acts of love, friendship and mercy.  The doors to the cathedral
are very large, and made mostly out of wood.  They have long bands of iron,
which are nailed to the planks, keeping the door in one piece.

A Small Room
  As you walk through the stained glass window, you find a small room. The room
is bare, and seems to only serve as a housing for the glass and a few 
statues. A small passage leads to the south.

A Dark Room...
  As you step into the room, you see very little except a single throne and 
torches. The walls seem to have been carved out of obsidian as they are of 
the deepest black, and absorb what little light that the torches provide. As 
you take steps further into the room, you can hear a quiet laughing coming 
from the west.

  As you enter the room, you can see a rather large statue of some sort of
twisted and mangled creature.  On the wall, you notice that there are words
carved.  Most refer to Fortune, Fame, Love and Pleasure.  Then, as you look
back to the statue, you notice that it is moving, and heading towards you!

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

You wake up on Medical beds, then stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

     A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

As you continue down the fields,you realize that 
this was once a battlefield of the worthy and ruthless
but it has now been swept and turned into a training

Apart from the worn paths and unpleasant pools of mud,
this field is still be used as a training center, and
an older man in a brown uniform who is as tough as

Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to

You clutch the rope ladder tightly and pull yourself into the ship.

Bottom Cargo Hold of the Airship
  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable
script on them.  Hidden amongst a few larger crates in the corner is a
ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

In front of The Bowsprit
  The view from the bowsprit is breathtaking.  You can see the horizon in
the far off distance.  Birds are flying and gliding all about the airship in
curiosity.  This of course has led to a problem, as the airship always
tends to attract birds, and well they do have bodily functions too.  The
swabs are always scraping the dung off the deck.  This part of this ship is
frequented by sailors for its excellent view of the surrounding area -- that
is when they get one of their rare breaks.

Before the Bow
  From this foward part of the ship, you have a good vantage point of the
entire ship.  As you look towards the stern, you realize the immensity of
the ship.  Although your vision is somewhat impaired by people who are
walking about, you can just barely see the stern of the ship -- meaning that
the ship is a good eight, nine hundred feet long.  The technology that keeps
this up is terribly frightening.  If they can put a sea-born vessel in the
air, what is next?

Field Outside The House of The Rising Sun
  The land around here has been ravaged by many battles.  The rebellion is
always in a constant state of warfare.  You stand outside the House of The
Rising Sun, an inn notorious for being a rebellion hideout.  It is visited
by the scum of the earth, and the lowest creatures of the land.  The
building itself is quite a landmark in its own historical right.  Before the
rebellion it was known throughout the land as one of the finest inns. 
However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations
against the Empire.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

Bar Room
  A large wooden table is right before you.  Behind this table you can see
all manners of cups, glasses, shotglasses, and bottles of alcohol.  At one
time this bar was quite respectable, however ever since the rebellion has
overrun it, it has been run into the ground with the rest of the inn.  The
once fine mahogany bar table is now full of holes and is stained horribly
from uncleaned spilled drinks and vomit.  Should the rebels ever be ousted
the entire inn, especially the bar would have to be entirely rebuilt. 
Unfortunately this bar table which has stood for such an incredibly long
time, ever since the inn was built many hundreds of years ago, would have to
be thrown away.  Slopped about the room are a few drunks, most have passed
out from the enormous amounts of alcohol which they consume.

Hallway in The House of The Rising Sun
  The hallway is a complete mess.  Various patrons lay around the hall
sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the
floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any
human could live in this sort of environment.  The filth in this room is just
incredible.  The smell could knock out a giant rhinoceros, it's so potent. 
The inn is in desperate need of about thirty or forty good maids.

  This odd room is strikingly different from the rest of the inn.  It is
perhaps the only room in this godforsaken place that isn't scathed with
waste and filth.  Quite the contrary in fact, the room is spic and span the
walls could be shining they are so clean.  A large circular table sits in
the center of the room.  There are about twenty chairs sitting around the
table.  The rebellion is supposedly split into twenty factions, perhaps each
seat is for each leader of each faction.  Though a meeting of all twenty
factions rarely takes place, they leave the option open, should such an
event ever come up.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

  From this foward part of the ship, you have a good vantage point of the
entire ship.  As you look towards the stern, you realize the immensity of
the ship.  Although your vision is somewhat impaired by people who are
walking about, you can just barely see the stern of the ship -- meaning that
the ship is a good eight, nine hundred feet long.  The technology that keeps
this up is terribly frightening.  If they can put a sea-born vessel in the

  From this foward part of the ship, you have a good vantage point of the
entire ship.  As you look towards the stern, you realize the immensity of
the ship.  Although your vision is somewhat impaired by people who are
walking about, you can just barely see the stern of the ship -- meaning that
the ship is a good eight, nine hundred feet long.  The technology that keeps
this up is terribly frightening.  If they can put a sea-born vessel in the

In front of The Bowsprit
  The view from the bowsprit is breathtaking.  You can see the horizon in
the far off distance.  Birds are flying and gliding all about the airship in
curiosity.  This of course has led to a problem, as the airship always
tends to attract birds, and well they do have bodily functions too.  The
swabs are always scraping the dung off the deck.  This part of this ship is
frequented by sailors for its excellent view of the surrounding area -- that
is when they get one of their rare breaks.

  The large grassy fields part somewhat here.  The part of the field where
the grass parts appears to be some sort of path.  It is unlikely anything
could grow on this ground for it has the looks of ground which has been
tread upon for hundreds of years.  Perhaps this path will take you to the
imperial palace.  Unfortunately you are not sure, and you would not want to
stray onto a path which did not lead to the palace.  Perhaps you should ask
one of the locals about it?

Pasture
  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one
would buy their food.

  The fields of Conadrain surround you.  Conadrain derives much of its
wealth from the nutrient rich soil within its lands.  They are careful
however to preserve these nutrients and have developed a system to maximize
the use while not destroying the environment.  Many bandits have tried to
steal from these fields, however they always seem to get caught.  It is

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Syntax: cast disrupt <spell name>
        cast disrupt <target> <spell name>
Spell Number: 412

A more focused version of the somewhat chaotic Cancellation spell, disrupt
attempts to remove one particular spell affect that is present upon the
target. If no target is specified, the caster is assumed to be trying to
remove the spell from themselves. You can only disrupt a spell if you have
a working knowledge of the spell you wish to disrupt.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Pasture
  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one
would buy their food.

Heading Towards the Palace
  The large grassy fields part somewhat here.  The part of the field where
the grass parts appears to be some sort of path.  It is unlikely anything
could grow on this ground for it has the looks of ground which has been
tread upon for hundreds of years.  Perhaps this path will take you to the
imperial palace.  Unfortunately you are not sure, and you would not want to
stray onto a path which did not lead to the palace.  Perhaps you should ask
one of the locals about it?

palace seems to have some sort of cooling system installed.  The halls
extend for great distances in every direction.  Occasionally you will see a

West Hallway
  Working in the Imperial Palace has always been a favorite assignment of
the men in the army.  Only the most elite of the soldiers are selected to
patrol these halls, watch over the Emperor while he is attending to matters
of state, and escort guests to and from the places they need to be.  However
the only reason one might not care to pull guard duty at the palace is the
lack of adventure.  Many of the guards join because of the great stories
their fathers and their grandfathers have told them about the ancient wars. 
In a way though one could look at being behind the lines as favorable, for
you are running almost no risk of being killed.

slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

  The stairs before you rise up in a magnificent way.  They spiral up around

Palace Intersection (2191)

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can

these are the fields of the Prince himself!

Mess Hall
  This is the northern half of the mess hall.  It is as large as the
southern half, set up in a very similar fashion -- to accommodate the most
number of people in the smallest comfortable amount of space.  There is an
exit to the west that leads to the main hallway on this level of the
airship.  To the south is the rest of the mess hall and, further beyond,
you can see the cooking area.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is

Bar Room
  A large wooden table is right before you.  Behind this table you can see
all manners of cups, glasses, shotglasses, and bottles of alcohol.  At one
time this bar was quite respectable, however ever since the rebellion has
overrun it, it has been run into the ground with the rest of the inn.  The
once fine mahogany bar table is now full of holes and is stained horribly
from uncleaned spilled drinks and vomit.  Should the rebels ever be ousted
the entire inn, especially the bar would have to be entirely rebuilt. 
Unfortunately this bar table which has stood for such an incredibly long
time, ever since the inn was built many hundreds of years ago, would have to
be thrown away.  Slopped about the room are a few drunks, most have passed
out from the enormous amounts of alcohol which they consume.

  The hallway is a complete mess.  Various patrons lay around the hall
sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the
floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any
human could live in this sort of environment.  The filth in this room is just

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up
against the wall which leads up to the bell tower.

  Even though this church is that of an unholy god, the architecture is quite

the church is breathtaking.  One part of the design is quite annoying though:
the roof is so low that it makes walking around here difficult, and
definitely adds to the claustrophobic effect.  The church benches are 
for the most part quite empty, but there are a number of worshippers

amazing.  The way that the masons sculpted and carved the stone which makes up
the church is breathtaking.  One part of the design is quite annoying though:
the roof is so low that it makes walking around here difficult, and
definitely adds to the claustrophobic effect.  The church benches are 
for the most part quite empty, but there are a number of worshippers
in the front row.

  Approaching the center of the room, you can see that it is an
sacrificial altar. It must be to the god of this place. Upon examining
it you can see that it hasn't been used for quite some time. The
knife is still on the altar. Must have been made awhile before the
outlaw of such practices. To the left and right of you the church

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up
against the wall which leads up to the bell tower.

Bell Tower (G)
  After clearing the final step of the ladder the first thing that catches
your attention are the barrages of enormous bells hanging from the roof of
the tower.  The room itself consists of the single railway that stretches
around the entire room, and a small walkway which goes straight under the
bells.  However the only time that walkway is used when the bells are in
desperate need of repair, because should the bells go off when someone is
under them, it could easily deafen a man.  The walls of the tower allow
people to look outside them, which can be useful at times to spot arriving
people long before they actually arrive at the church.

they almost look like kegs of alcohol.  For the most part the are sealed up
tightly, however one seems to have been punctured.  The material that is
dripping out of it seems to be blood.  Maybe these contain the left over
material from their ancient sacrifical rites, though god knows why they

being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

  You are standing in the middle of a vast field.  It would be a

immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to
be a flying ship.  What's even more interesting, is there is a rope ladder
which hangs down from the side of the ship.  It's the perfect invitation for
you to enter.

building itself is quite a landmark in its own historical right.  Before the
rebellion it was known throughout the land as one of the finest inns. 
However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like

today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up

Pushing the carpet out of the way, a trap door is revealed.
After climbing through the trap door, you find yourself in a hallway.
Following the hallway and a ladder bring you to the fortress entrance.

Inside the Rebel Fortress
  The outside walls are covered with a thin layer of mold and other
plant life. But looking at the door, you can tell that it was just put
in, probably as a defense against the Empire's troops. You could
easily walk in because there are no guards present. It makes you wonder
that it probably isn't some big headquarters because otherwise it would be
more well guarded that this.

  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up

Before the Altar of Maldenar
  Approaching the center of the room, you can see that it is an
sacrificial altar. It must be to the god of this place. Upon examining
it you can see that it hasn't been used for quite some time. The
knife is still on the altar. Must have been made awhile before the
outlaw of such practices. To the left and right of you the church
continues. To the north you can see a small alcove, probably for the
head of this place.

Western Church Hall
  The church of Maldenar is a dreary and gloomy place for those who may not
worship him.  Only a few remain that enjoy entering this place for their
worship.  Even though the numbers have declined over the years the
zealousness of those who remain is quite intact.  Day after day these people
come to pay homage to their dark god.  They would be willing to do anything
for him, even kill for him.  The age of the church is quite apparent as the
floor creaks and dust seems to be everywhere, it could probably use a nice
overhaul in its design.  However the followers of Maldenar would not dare do
anything to change or hurt this place of their god.

Back of the Church
  The back of the church is rather empty.  The only object that is really
of any importance is a small urn which is propped up against the back wall. 
From this point of the church you can see just how vast this church really
is.  There must be a hundred rows of benches, however less than forty of
them are actually being used.  Off to the west there is a small hallway
which connects this aisle to the western aisle of the church.

leaves an eerie mark up on the room.  The church hallway continues in the

  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable

Grassy Field
  The fields of Conadrain surround you.  Conadrain derives much of its
wealth from the nutrient rich soil within its lands.  They are careful
however to preserve these nutrients and have developed a system to maximize
the use while not destroying the environment.  Many bandits have tried to
steal from these fields, however they always seem to get caught.  It is
rumored that there is a beautiful apple orchard around here somewhere.

  The fields are dotted with various farmhouses.  These farmhouses are run
by state-hired workers.  These people are trained in the general running of
farmland, as well as breeding.  One of the things that has made the
Conadrain economy shoot up is the excellent products which their highly
advanced breeding program has produced.  Many of the farmers live out here,
though the majority still live in some nearby town.  The rare opportunity of
getting your own farmhouse is only given to the smartest and best farmers in
the employment of the Empire.

fairly popular for you get a small part of the harvest every year.  This

palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

Commander Scardale says 'Okay then.  I will take you further into the palace.'

You follow Commander Scardale up the stairs and deeper into the palace.

On top of the stairs
  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The
things upon the first floor become so much more clear, and visible.  The
upper floor is in somewhat of a disarray.  Papers are thrown about here and
there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing
-- kind of odd for an Emperor's palace.  One would think that they could find
something to do.

Beginning of the long hall
  The hall seems to stretch on forever, as far as the eye can see.  Everywhere you
look is hallway, amazingly decorated.  If the halls downstairs were extravagant,
these are priceless -- beautiful vases and giant tapestries adorn the walls.
The tapestries depict the history of the Empire and thus are valuable for both
their subject and their artistry.

Near the end of the hall
  The hall actually seems to be coming to end.  The feint hint of a door of
some sort can be seen to the north of here.  Surprisingly the decor of the
wall has thinned out somewhat here.  This part of the hall is quite uncommon
in this castle, for it is quite blank.  However you can see certain parts of
the wall which have been marked out for new things to be placed.  By the
size of the markings you would guess that they are probably going to add
some new tapestries.  Maybe they have some new stories to tell.

Before the Council Chamber
  The hall has come to an end here.  Before you lies a door of immense size.
It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut
right now, because it appears that Talsa is having a council right now. 
Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost
immediate death.

  The hall has come to an end here.  Before you lies a door of immense size.
It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut
right now, because it appears that Talsa is having a council right now. 
Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost
immediate death.

Near the end of the hall
  The hall actually seems to be coming to end.  The feint hint of a door of
some sort can be seen to the north of here.  Surprisingly the decor of the
wall has thinned out somewhat here.  This part of the hall is quite uncommon
in this castle, for it is quite blank.  However you can see certain parts of
the wall which have been marked out for new things to be placed.  By the
size of the markings you would guess that they are probably going to add
some new tapestries.  Maybe they have some new stories to tell.

Beginning of the long hall (2191)

On top of the stairs
  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The
things upon the first floor become so much more clear, and visible.  The
upper floor is in somewhat of a disarray.  Papers are thrown about here and
there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing
-- kind of odd for an Emperor's palace.  One would think that they could find
something to do.

Palace Intersection
  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one

  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The

there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing

It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut
right now, because it appears that Talsa is having a council right now. 
Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Beginning of the long hall (2191)

On top of the stairs
  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The
things upon the first floor become so much more clear, and visible.  The
upper floor is in somewhat of a disarray.  Papers are thrown about here and
there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing
-- kind of odd for an Emperor's palace.  One would think that they could find
something to do.

Palace Intersection
  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable

agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing

Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost

  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.  

[ Exits: (south) ]
(Golden Aura) (White Aura) Cainsden Dalio, the Trade Council, is reading his trading records.
(Golden Aura) (White Aura) Emperor Talsa is having a meeting with his counselors.

Rebellion.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Open Field
  You are standing in the middle of a vast field.  It would be a
run-of-the-mill field, except for the fact that there's a strange object of
immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to
be a flying ship.  What's even more interesting, is there is a rope ladder
which hangs down from the side of the ship.  It's the perfect invitation for
you to enter.

Bottom Cargo Hold of the Airship
  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable
script on them.  Hidden amongst a few larger crates in the corner is a
ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

The Captain of the Airship says, "We'll go to Moricand."

The Captain yells to the crew and the ship starts to fly.
After a few days of travel, you look below and see a good-sized tavern.
The Captain orders the crew to lower the ladder.

The Captain of the Airship says, "Okay, we'll be here until you want to go
 somewhere else."
The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Field Outside The House of The Rising Sun
  The land around here has been ravaged by many battles.  The rebellion is
always in a constant state of warfare.  You stand outside the House of The
Rising Sun, an inn notorious for being a rebellion hideout.  It is visited
by the scum of the earth, and the lowest creatures of the land.  The
building itself is quite a landmark in its own historical right.  Before the
rebellion it was known throughout the land as one of the finest inns. 
However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations
against the Empire.

Hallway in The House of The Rising Sun
  The hallway is a complete mess.  Various patrons lay around the hall
sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the
floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any
human could live in this sort of environment.  The filth in this room is just
incredible.  The smell could knock out a giant rhinoceros, it's so potent. 
The inn is in desperate need of about thirty or forty good maids.

Turn in Hallway
  The hall seems to fork to the north and south here.  The room is
completely dark.  There are a few lamps hanging upon the wall, however they
seem to have been out for quite some time now.  The whole floor seems to
creep every time you take a step in the hall.  The walls look as if they
could cave in at any moment.  It's a wonder this place hasn't been abandoned
and condemned for centuries now.

Hallway in The House of The Rising Sun
  The hallway is a complete mess.  Various patrons lay around the hall
sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the
floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any
human could live in this sort of environment.  The filth in this room is just
incredible.  The smell could knock out a giant rhinoceros, it's so potent.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

Entrance to Maldenar's Temple
  Upon entering this dark, evil place, you can sense that this is a place
of evil worship.  Faint chants can be heard throughout this room.  The low
light also adds to the effect of the evil in this most unholy place.  To the
north you can see some sort of altar, but from the distance you can not be
too sure.  You feel like you don't want to be here for too long.

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up
against the wall which leads up to the bell tower.

Bishop Dracul exclaims 'Ahh, thank you for finding the map for me!'
Bishop Dracul says 'I can finally finish that project I've been working on.'
Bishop Dracul asks 'Now, you were looking for the rebel fort, right?'

The old man gets up from his chair and moves it aside.
Pushing the carpet out of the way, a trap door is revealed.
After climbing through the trap door, you find yourself in a hallway.
Following the hallway and a ladder bring you to the fortress entrance.

Inside the Rebel Fortress
  The outside walls are covered with a thin layer of mold and other
plant life. But looking at the door, you can tell that it was just put
in, probably as a defense against the Empire's troops. You could
easily walk in because there are no guards present. It makes you wonder
that it probably isn't some big headquarters because otherwise it would be
more well guarded that this.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An

Field Outside The House of The Rising Sun
  The land around here has been ravaged by many battles.  The rebellion is
always in a constant state of warfare.  You stand outside the House of The
Rising Sun, an inn notorious for being a rebellion hideout.  It is visited
by the scum of the earth, and the lowest creatures of the land.  The
building itself is quite a landmark in its own historical right.  Before the
rebellion it was known throughout the land as one of the finest inns. 
However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations
against the Empire.

Hallway in The House of The Rising Sun
  The hallway is a complete mess.  Various patrons lay around the hall
sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the
floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any
human could live in this sort of environment.  The filth in this room is just
incredible.  The smell could knock out a giant rhinoceros, it's so potent. 
The inn is in desperate need of about thirty or forty good maids.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

Sleeping Quarters
  The room which you have just walked into is rather large.  Nearly a
hundred feet long, it stretches for quite some while.  On either side of the
room there are bunks after bunks after bunks.  This room was not originally
part of the inn, but was added when the rebellion overran this place.  They
built these quarters for the bodyguard units of the visiting leaders of the
rebellion.

Entrance to Maldenar's Temple
  Upon entering this dark, evil place, you can sense that this is a place
of evil worship.  Faint chants can be heard throughout this room.  The low
light also adds to the effect of the evil in this most unholy place.  To the
north you can see some sort of altar, but from the distance you can not be
too sure.  You feel like you don't want to be here for too long.

  Approaching the center of the room, you can see that it is an
sacrificial altar. It must be to the god of this place. Upon examining
it you can see that it hasn't been used for quite some time. The
knife is still on the altar. Must have been made awhile before the
outlaw of such practices. To the left and right of you the church
continues. To the north you can see a small alcove, probably for the
head of this place.

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up
against the wall which leads up to the bell tower.

Field Outside The House of The Rising Sun
  The land around here has been ravaged by many battles.  The rebellion is
always in a constant state of warfare.  You stand outside the House of The
Rising Sun, an inn notorious for being a rebellion hideout.  It is visited
by the scum of the earth, and the lowest creatures of the land.  The
building itself is quite a landmark in its own historical right.  Before the
rebellion it was known throughout the land as one of the finest inns. 
However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations
against the Empire.

Entrance to Maldenar's Temple
  Upon entering this dark, evil place, you can sense that this is a place
of evil worship.  Faint chants can be heard throughout this room.  The low
light also adds to the effect of the evil in this most unholy place.  To the
north you can see some sort of altar, but from the distance you can not be
too sure.  You feel like you don't want to be here for too long.

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up
against the wall which leads up to the bell tower.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are

this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

Sleeping Quarters
  The room which you have just walked into is rather large.  Nearly a
hundred feet long, it stretches for quite some while.  On either side of the
room there are bunks after bunks after bunks.  This room was not originally
part of the inn, but was added when the rebellion overran this place.  They
built these quarters for the bodyguard units of the visiting leaders of the
rebellion.

Entrance to Maldenar's Temple
  Upon entering this dark, evil place, you can sense that this is a place
of evil worship.  Faint chants can be heard throughout this room.  The low
light also adds to the effect of the evil in this most unholy place.  To the
north you can see some sort of altar, but from the distance you can not be
too sure.  You feel like you don't want to be here for too long.

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up
against the wall which leads up to the bell tower.

Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

Room (G)
  This odd room is strikingly different from the rest of the inn.  It is
perhaps the only room in this godforsaken place that isn't scathed with
waste and filth.  Quite the contrary in fact, the room is spic and span the
walls could be shining they are so clean.  A large circular table sits in
the center of the room.  There are about twenty chairs sitting around the
table.  The rebellion is supposedly split into twenty factions, perhaps each
seat is for each leader of each faction.  Though a meeting of all twenty
factions rarely takes place, they leave the option open, should such an
event ever come up.

Sleeping Quarters
  The room which you have just walked into is rather large.  Nearly a
hundred feet long, it stretches for quite some while.  On either side of the
room there are bunks after bunks after bunks.  This room was not originally
part of the inn, but was added when the rebellion overran this place.  They
built these quarters for the bodyguard units of the visiting leaders of the
rebellion.

You hurriedly leave the inn, and arrive at the church in minutes.

Entrance to Maldenar's Temple
  Upon entering this dark, evil place, you can sense that this is a place
of evil worship.  Faint chants can be heard throughout this room.  The low
light also adds to the effect of the evil in this most unholy place.  To the
north you can see some sort of altar, but from the distance you can not be
too sure.  You feel like you don't want to be here for too long.

Before the Altar of Maldenar (2191)

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up
against the wall which leads up to the bell tower.

Bishop Dracul bows before you.
Bishop Dracul exclaims 'Ahh, thank you for finding the map for me!'
Bishop Dracul says 'I can finally finish that project I've been working on.'
Bishop Dracul asks 'Now, you were looking for the rebel fort, right?'

The old man gets up from his chair and moves it aside.
Pushing the carpet out of the way, a trap door is revealed.
After climbing through the trap door, you find yourself in a hallway.
Following the hallway and a ladder bring you to the fortress entrance.

Inside the Rebel Fortress
  The outside walls are covered with a thin layer of mold and other
plant life. But looking at the door, you can tell that it was just put
in, probably as a defense against the Empire's troops. You could
easily walk in because there are no guards present. It makes you wonder
that it probably isn't some big headquarters because otherwise it would be
more well guarded that this.

Clean Hallway
  As you walk by here you see a couple of rebel officers sitting on the
ground.  As you listen in you can hear them talking about certain
plans on how to attack the Empire's army. One says that they
don't have enough supplies to do it. Another just looks at you. You
think at least they are not sitting in the dirtier sections of the

Rebel Hallway
  Judging from the lack for old supplies on the floor, you can tell
that this section of the fort has been clean. Probably as a precaution
in case the leaders have to flee this place. To the north you can
see cleaner hallway; to the east the crowded dirty intersection
calls for you. As you walk around, you can hear some of the rebel
officers talking about what they are going to do when the war is over.
After hearing the stories of the rebels being evil, you don't know
what to think.  They seem normal to you. But you shrug and walk along.

Bottom Cargo Hold of the Airship
  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable
script on them.  Hidden amongst a few larger crates in the corner is a
ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can

Grassy Field (2390)

Pasture
  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one
would buy their food.

  The large grassy fields part somewhat here.  The part of the field where
the grass parts appears to be some sort of path.  It is unlikely anything
could grow on this ground for it has the looks of ground which has been
tread upon for hundreds of years.  Perhaps this path will take you to the
imperial palace.  Unfortunately you are not sure, and you would not want to
stray onto a path which did not lead to the palace.  Perhaps you should ask

Room (G)
  This odd room is strikingly different from the rest of the inn.  It is
perhaps the only room in this godforsaken place that isn't scathed with
waste and filth.  Quite the contrary in fact, the room is spic and span the
walls could be shining they are so clean.  A large circular table sits in
the center of the room.  There are about twenty chairs sitting around the
table.  The rebellion is supposedly split into twenty factions, perhaps each
seat is for each leader of each faction.  Though a meeting of all twenty
factions rarely takes place, they leave the option open, should such an
event ever come up.

Turn in Hallway
  The hall seems to fork to the north and south here.  The room is
completely dark.  There are a few lamps hanging upon the wall, however they
seem to have been out for quite some time now.  The whole floor seems to
creep every time you take a step in the hall.  The walls look as if they
could cave in at any moment.  It's a wonder this place hasn't been abandoned
and condemned for centuries now.

Hallway in The House of The Rising Sun
  The hallway is a complete mess.  Various patrons lay around the hall
sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the
floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any
human could live in this sort of environment.  The filth in this room is just
incredible.  The smell could knock out a giant rhinoceros, it's so potent. 
The inn is in desperate need of about thirty or forty good maids.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

Entrance to Maldenar's Temple
  Upon entering this dark, evil place, you can sense that this is a place
of evil worship.  Faint chants can be heard throughout this room.  The low
light also adds to the effect of the evil in this most unholy place.  To the

small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive

Bell Tower (G)
  After clearing the final step of the ladder the first thing that catches
your attention are the barrages of enormous bells hanging from the roof of
the tower.  The room itself consists of the single railway that stretches
around the entire room, and a small walkway which goes straight under the
bells.  However the only time that walkway is used when the bells are in
desperate need of repair, because should the bells go off when someone is
under them, it could easily deafen a man.  The walls of the tower allow
people to look outside them, which can be useful at times to spot arriving
people long before they actually arrive at the church.

Field Outside The House of The Rising Sun
  The land around here has been ravaged by many battles.  The rebellion is
always in a constant state of warfare.  You stand outside the House of The
Rising Sun, an inn notorious for being a rebellion hideout.  It is visited
by the scum of the earth, and the lowest creatures of the land.  The
building itself is quite a landmark in its own historical right.  Before the
rebellion it was known throughout the land as one of the finest inns. 
However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations
against the Empire.

seat is for each leader of each faction.  Though a meeting of all twenty
factions rarely takes place, they leave the option open, should such an

  The hallway is a complete mess.  Various patrons lay around the hall
sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the
floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any
human could live in this sort of environment.  The filth in this room is just
incredible.  The smell could knock out a giant rhinoceros, it's so potent.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up

Bottom Cargo Hold of the Airship
  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable
script on them.  Hidden amongst a few larger crates in the corner is a
ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

The Captain of the Airship nods at you in agreement.
The Captain of the Airship says, "We'll go to Conadrain."

The Captain yells to the crew and the ship starts to fly.
After a few days of travel, you look below and see a field with cows and other livestock.
The Captain orders the crew to lower the ladder.

The Captain of the Airship says, "Okay, we'll be here until you want to go
 somewhere else."
The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can
see.  A large breeze stirs the foot tall grass in beautiful waves.  The area
is cloaked in the shadow of the airship, and you notice some rope trailing
beneath the beast.  The palace of the Conadrains lies a few miles ahead as
these are the fields of the Prince himself!

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

Before the Stairs
  The stairs before you rise up in a magnificent way.  They spiral up around
and around until they reach the second floor.  The stairs themselves are
constructed of iron.  The iron has been polished to a high shine.  However
most of the iron is not visible, since the stairs are draped in a
purplish velvet.  You glance upwards and wonder what might be up on the
second floor.

     (Magic) A large iron bound chest rests here.
(Red Aura) An officer of the Talsanian Army is waiting to speak with the Emperor.

(Red Aura) An officer of the Talsanian Army is waiting to speak with the Emperor.

Commander Scardale says, "The Empire enjoys doing business with you."

You give leather training gloves to Commander Scardale.
Commander Scardale exclaims 'Ahh, you brought the gloves I requested!'
Commander Scardale says 'Okay then.  I will take you further into the palace.'

You follow Commander Scardale up the stairs and deeper into the palace.

On top of the stairs
  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The
things upon the first floor become so much more clear, and visible.  The
upper floor is in somewhat of a disarray.  Papers are thrown about here and
there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing
-- kind of odd for an Emperor's palace.  One would think that they could find
something to do.

Beginning of the long hall (2310)

Near the end of the hall (2310)

Before the Council Chamber
  The hall has come to an end here.  Before you lies a door of immense size.
It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut
right now, because it appears that Talsa is having a council right now. 
Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost
immediate death.

A small party of guards escorts you to Talsa's council chambers.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet

** Task Hint  : Your 'tasks' list has been updated with a new hint.
Open Field
  You are standing in the middle of a vast field.  It would be a
run-of-the-mill field, except for the fact that there's a strange object of
immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to
be a flying ship.  What's even more interesting, is there is a rope ladder
which hangs down from the side of the ship.  It's the perfect invitation for
you to enter.

tasks here

       Talsa : Become Admiral of the Polaris Star Airlines.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Find who needs help in the Airship.

Go around to various places, ask them if they need help. Most of them don't 
speak standard speech, so be careful to say 'Can I help you?' to them." 

The pilot will check your qualifications and tell you when you can become an 
admiral.

Task 6  : Sarah Lonestar's trade agreement.

Sarah says, "Bring me clothing, and jewelry, so I can look pretty and 
sophisticated. Do this, and we can make a deal." 

Task 7  : The Commander's trade agreement.

Commander Scardale says, "We are having trouble in the war; we need weapons 
and armor. Bring me things I can use and we'll have a deal." 

Task 8  : Lenna's trade items.

Lenna Salvanna says, "I want treasure. Bring me nice things I can use." 

Task 9  : Bishop Dracul's requirements.

Bishop Dracul says, "Items for the people and my religion, that's why I'll 
make an agreement." 

Task 10 : The Cook takes a hand.

A cook says, "Around here we're too busy to stand around thinking. Bring me 
something I can use." 

Task 11 : Make a contract with Talsa.

Ask Talsa to make a contract with Polaris Airlines.

Talsa wants a new portal from Torlad.

Task 12 : Make a contract between the rebels and Polaris.

Ask the rebels to make a contract with Polaris Airlines.

Torlad says, "Tell Talsa you will save souls.  That'll spin his top."

Task 14 : Get a portal from Talsa.

Torlad says,"Rumors are, Talsa gives a portal to somewhere to the Empire's 
defenders. I want one of those portals. This portal must be one that Talsa 
gives to you personally. No second-hand stuff, no junk, no fakes." 

Only loyal council members can save souls.

Bottom Cargo Hold of the Airship
  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable
script on them.  Hidden amongst a few larger crates in the corner is a
ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

End of Hallway
  The hall tapers to an end here.  Even though it is the end of the hall,
it still remains wide enough to support traffic going to either the mess
hall or sleeping quarters.

Beginning of the Stairwell (2381)

Officer's Quarters (G)
  These quarters are lavishly decorated and furbished with the finest
items.  They are arranged about the area in the uniform fashion typical of
this airship.  This is, quite obviously, where the higher-ranking officers
spend much of their personal time.

The Captain of the Airship nods at you in agreement.
The Captain of the Airship says, "We'll go to Conadrain."

The Captain yells to the crew and the ship starts to fly.
After a few days of travel, you look below and see a field with cows and other livestock.
The Captain orders the crew to lower the ladder.

The Captain of the Airship says, "Okay, we'll be here until you want to go
 somewhere else."
The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can
see.  A large breeze stirs the foot tall grass in beautiful waves.  The area
is cloaked in the shadow of the airship, and you notice some rope trailing
beneath the beast.  The palace of the Conadrains lies a few miles ahead as
these are the fields of the Prince himself!

Pasture
  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one
would buy their food.

  The large grassy fields part somewhat here.  The part of the field where
the grass parts appears to be some sort of path.  It is unlikely anything
could grow on this ground for it has the looks of ground which has been

You give a Vegetable to Sarah Lonestar.
Sarah Lonestar exclaims 'Oh, thank you!  Thank you!'
Sarah Lonestar says 'Now I can go to the palace and complete my work there.'
Sarah Lonestar says 'Come with me!  When your business is done, you can visit my chamber.'
Sarah Lonestar winks suggestively at you.

As the maid walks down the path, you begin to see the palace.
The wonderful design captivates you as you get closer.
The guards stop the maid temporarily, then open the door and step aside.
She leaves as you enter the main hall, off to do some work.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

(Golden Aura) This guard is assigned to this hallway, and you wonder at its importance.

Palace Intersection
  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

Before the Stairs
  The stairs before you rise up in a magnificent way.  They spiral up around
and around until they reach the second floor.  The stairs themselves are
constructed of iron.  The iron has been polished to a high shine.  However
most of the iron is not visible, since the stairs are draped in a
purplish velvet.  You glance upwards and wonder what might be up on the
second floor.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Heading Towards the Palace
  The large grassy fields part somewhat here.  The part of the field where
the grass parts appears to be some sort of path.  It is unlikely anything
could grow on this ground for it has the looks of ground which has been
tread upon for hundreds of years.  Perhaps this path will take you to the
imperial palace.  Unfortunately you are not sure, and you would not want to
stray onto a path which did not lead to the palace.  Perhaps you should ask
one of the locals about it?

As the maid walks down the path, you begin to see the palace.
The wonderful design captivates you as you get closer.
The guards stop the maid temporarily, then open the door and step aside.
She leaves as you enter the main hall, off to do some work.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

Palace Intersection
  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

Before the Stairs
  The stairs before you rise up in a magnificent way.  They spiral up around
and around until they reach the second floor.  The stairs themselves are
constructed of iron.  The iron has been polished to a high shine.  However
most of the iron is not visible, since the stairs are draped in a
purplish velvet.  You glance upwards and wonder what might be up on the
second floor.

You follow Commander Scardale up the stairs and deeper into the palace.

On top of the stairs
  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The
things upon the first floor become so much more clear, and visible.  The
upper floor is in somewhat of a disarray.  Papers are thrown about here and
there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing
-- kind of odd for an Emperor's palace.  One would think that they could find
something to do.

  The hall has come to an end here.  Before you lies a door of immense size.
It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut
right now, because it appears that Talsa is having a council right now. 
Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost
immediate death.

A small party of guards escorts you to Talsa's council chambers.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Bottom Cargo Hold of the Airship
  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable
script on them.  Hidden amongst a few larger crates in the corner is a
ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

Field Outside The House of The Rising Sun
  The land around here has been ravaged by many battles.  The rebellion is
always in a constant state of warfare.  You stand outside the House of The
Rising Sun, an inn notorious for being a rebellion hideout.  It is visited
by the scum of the earth, and the lowest creatures of the land.  The
building itself is quite a landmark in its own historical right.  Before the
rebellion it was known throughout the land as one of the finest inns. 
However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations
against the Empire.

Task 1  : Find who needs help in the Airship.

Go around to various places, ask them if they need help. Most of them don't 
speak standard speech, so be careful to say 'Can I help you?' to them." 

The pilot will check your qualifications and tell you when you can become an 
admiral.

Task 6  : Sarah Lonestar's trade agreement.

Sarah says, "Bring me clothing, and jewelry, so I can look pretty and 
sophisticated. Do this, and we can make a deal." 

Sarah has a hard time seeing you with the sun in her eyes. Perhaps something 
to block the sun?

defenders. I want one of those portals. This portal must be one that Talsa 
gives to you personally. No second-hand stuff, no junk, no fakes." 

Only loyal council members can save souls.

Hallway in The House of The Rising Sun
  The hallway is a complete mess.  Various patrons lay around the hall
sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the
floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any
human could live in this sort of environment.  The filth in this room is just
incredible.  The smell could knock out a giant rhinoceros, it's so potent. 
The inn is in desperate need of about thirty or forty good maids.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

Bar Room
  A large wooden table is right before you.  Behind this table you can see
all manners of cups, glasses, shotglasses, and bottles of alcohol.  At one
time this bar was quite respectable, however ever since the rebellion has
overrun it, it has been run into the ground with the rest of the inn.  The
once fine mahogany bar table is now full of holes and is stained horribly
from uncleaned spilled drinks and vomit.  Should the rebels ever be ousted
the entire inn, especially the bar would have to be entirely rebuilt. 
Unfortunately this bar table which has stood for such an incredibly long
time, ever since the inn was built many hundreds of years ago, would have to
be thrown away.  Slopped about the room are a few drunks, most have passed
out from the enormous amounts of alcohol which they consume.

  Upon entering this dark, evil place, you can sense that this is a place
of evil worship.  Faint chants can be heard throughout this room.  The low

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable
script on them.  Hidden amongst a few larger crates in the corner is a
ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller

  The fields are dotted with various farmhouses.  These farmhouses are run
by state-hired workers.  These people are trained in the general running of
farmland, as well as breeding.  One of the things that has made the
Conadrain economy shoot up is the excellent products which their highly
advanced breeding program has produced.  Many of the farmers live out here,
though the majority still live in some nearby town.  The rare opportunity of
getting your own farmhouse is only given to the smartest and best farmers in

Officer's Quarters (G)
  These quarters are lavishly decorated and furbished with the finest

this airship.  This is, quite obviously, where the higher-ranking officers

The Captain of the Airship nods at you in agreement.
The Captain of the Airship says, "We'll go to Conadrain."

The Captain yells to the crew and the ship starts to fly.
After a few days of travel, you look below and see a field with cows and other livestock.
The Captain orders the crew to lower the ladder.

The Captain of the Airship says, "Okay, we'll be here until you want to go
 somewhere else."
The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can
see.  A large breeze stirs the foot tall grass in beautiful waves.  The area
is cloaked in the shadow of the airship, and you notice some rope trailing
beneath the beast.  The palace of the Conadrains lies a few miles ahead as
these are the fields of the Prince himself!

Pasture
  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one
would buy their food.

  The large grassy fields part somewhat here.  The part of the field where
the grass parts appears to be some sort of path.  It is unlikely anything
could grow on this ground for it has the looks of ground which has been
tread upon for hundreds of years.  Perhaps this path will take you to the
imperial palace.  Unfortunately you are not sure, and you would not want to
stray onto a path which did not lead to the palace.  Perhaps you should ask

Sarah Lonestar winks suggestively at you.

As the maid walks down the path, you begin to see the palace.
The wonderful design captivates you as you get closer.
The guards stop the maid temporarily, then open the door and step aside.
She leaves as you enter the main hall, off to do some work.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

Palace Intersection
  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

Before the Stairs
  The stairs before you rise up in a magnificent way.  They spiral up around
and around until they reach the second floor.  The stairs themselves are
constructed of iron.  The iron has been polished to a high shine.  However
most of the iron is not visible, since the stairs are draped in a
purplish velvet.  You glance upwards and wonder what might be up on the
second floor.

You follow Commander Scardale up the stairs and deeper into the palace.

On top of the stairs
  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The
things upon the first floor become so much more clear, and visible.  The
upper floor is in somewhat of a disarray.  Papers are thrown about here and
there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing
-- kind of odd for an Emperor's palace.  One would think that they could find
something to do.

It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut
right now, because it appears that Talsa is having a council right now. 
Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost
immediate death.

however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This

  You are standing in the middle of a vast field.  It would be a

immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to
be a flying ship.  What's even more interesting, is there is a rope ladder
which hangs down from the side of the ship.  It's the perfect invitation for
you to enter.

Field Outside The House of The Rising Sun
  The land around here has been ravaged by many battles.  The rebellion is
always in a constant state of warfare.  You stand outside the House of The
Rising Sun, an inn notorious for being a rebellion hideout.  It is visited
by the scum of the earth, and the lowest creatures of the land.  The
building itself is quite a landmark in its own historical right.  Before the
rebellion it was known throughout the land as one of the finest inns. 
However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations
against the Empire.

sleeping off their drunkenness.  A mirror which was hanging on the wall has
been completely shattered.  It appears it was shattered by someone being
thrown into it, though you can't really be sure of that.  The carpet of the

incredible.  The smell could knock out a giant rhinoceros, it's so potent.

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

room there are bunks after bunks after bunks.  This room was not originally

Entrance to Maldenar's Temple
  Upon entering this dark, evil place, you can sense that this is a place
of evil worship.  Faint chants can be heard throughout this room.  The low
light also adds to the effect of the evil in this most unholy place.  To the
north you can see some sort of altar, but from the distance you can not be

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like
most religions this is the driving force behind the religion of Maldenar
today.  In the far left hand corner of the room a small ladder is leaned up
against the wall which leads up to the bell tower.

Bishop Dracul exclaims 'Ahh, thank you for finding the map for me!'
Bishop Dracul says 'I can finally finish that project I've been working on.'
Bishop Dracul asks 'Now, you were looking for the rebel fort, right?'

The old man gets up from his chair and moves it aside.
Pushing the carpet out of the way, a trap door is revealed.
After climbing through the trap door, you find yourself in a hallway.
Following the hallway and a ladder bring you to the fortress entrance.

Inside the Rebel Fortress
  The outside walls are covered with a thin layer of mold and other
plant life. But looking at the door, you can tell that it was just put
in, probably as a defense against the Empire's troops. You could
easily walk in because there are no guards present. It makes you wonder
that it probably isn't some big headquarters because otherwise it would be
more well guarded that this.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  You are standing in the middle of a vast field.  It would be a
run-of-the-mill field, except for the fact that there's a strange object of
immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to
be a flying ship.  What's even more interesting, is there is a rope ladder
which hangs down from the side of the ship.  It's the perfect invitation for
you to enter.

crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable

  The sight of the airship is quite breathtaking.  The ship is an amazing

wonder just what keeps this thing in the air, other than wind that is.

Port Side of Airship
  This section of the ship rather hard to walk through.  Crate after crate
is stacked here.  Most of them are full of various objects.  Foodstuffs,
weapons, armour, and other assorted valuables.  Perhaps this is the booty
from a recent raid on the rebellion that this ship participated in.  If you
were to be caught snooping around here, you might get in a lot of trouble, so
you should probably leave.

Before the Bow
  From this foward part of the ship, you have a good vantage point of the
entire ship.  As you look towards the stern, you realize the immensity of
the ship.  Although your vision is somewhat impaired by people who are
walking about, you can just barely see the stern of the ship -- meaning that
the ship is a good eight, nine hundred feet long.  The technology that keeps
this up is terribly frightening.  If they can put a sea-born vessel in the
air, what is next?

  Scrub!  Scrub!  Scrub!  The familiar sound of the overseer is coming from
around here.  Ten or twelve new recruits are on there knees breaking their
back scrubbing this deck to a new shine.  Although it might seem cruel the
way they work these swabs, its only part of becoming a sailor.  The swabs
jobs is quite important, for if the deck were ever to become dirty, a person
running around might trip on a piece of trash, which would probably mean
death to the swabs who were suppose to clean that part.

  The view from the bowsprit is breathtaking.  You can see the horizon in
the far off distance.  Birds are flying and gliding all about the airship in
curiosity.  This of course has led to a problem, as the airship always
tends to attract birds, and well they do have bodily functions too.  The
swabs are always scraping the dung off the deck.  This part of this ship is
frequented by sailors for its excellent view of the surrounding area -- that
is when they get one of their rare breaks.

You say 'conadrain'
The Captain of the Airship nods at you in agreement.
The Captain of the Airship says, "We'll go to Conadrain."

The Captain yells to the crew and the ship starts to fly.
After a few days of travel, you look below and see a field with cows and other livestock.
The Captain orders the crew to lower the ladder.

The Captain of the Airship says, "Okay, we'll be here until you want to go
 somewhere else."
The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can
see.  A large breeze stirs the foot tall grass in beautiful waves.  The area
is cloaked in the shadow of the airship, and you notice some rope trailing
beneath the beast.  The palace of the Conadrains lies a few miles ahead as
these are the fields of the Prince himself!

farmland, as well as breeding.  One of the things that has made the
Conadrain economy shoot up is the excellent products which their highly
advanced breeding program has produced.  Many of the farmers live out here,
though the majority still live in some nearby town.  The rare opportunity of

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing

  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The
things upon the first floor become so much more clear, and visible.  The
upper floor is in somewhat of a disarray.  Papers are thrown about here and
there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing

It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut

Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost

You give an engineer's guild ring to Aldrien Monusus Alden.
Aldrien Monusus Alden nods at you in agreement.
Aldrien Monusus Alden says 'You are of the Engineers' Guild?  I will let you see the Emperor.'
Aldrien Monusus Alden says 'Thank you for visiting the Palace.'

A small party of guards escorts you to Talsa's council chambers.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to

The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can

  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life

Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one

As the maid walks down the path, you begin to see the palace.
The wonderful design captivates you as you get closer.
The guards stop the maid temporarily, then open the door and step aside.
She leaves as you enter the main hall, off to do some work.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground?

  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet

move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an

  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can

Pasture
  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one
would buy their food.

The guards stop the maid temporarily, then open the door and step aside.
She leaves as you enter the main hall, off to do some work.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

Before the Bow
  From this foward part of the ship, you have a good vantage point of the
entire ship.  As you look towards the stern, you realize the immensity of
the ship.  Although your vision is somewhat impaired by people who are
walking about, you can just barely see the stern of the ship -- meaning that
the ship is a good eight, nine hundred feet long.  The technology that keeps
this up is terribly frightening.  If they can put a sea-born vessel in the
air, what is next?

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some

  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The

  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet

move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

Palace Intersection
  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

Before the Stairs
  The stairs before you rise up in a magnificent way.  They spiral up around
and around until they reach the second floor.  The stairs themselves are
constructed of iron.  The iron has been polished to a high shine.  However
most of the iron is not visible, since the stairs are draped in a
purplish velvet.  You glance upwards and wonder what might be up on the

On top of the stairs
  The sight of the palace upon the second floor is quite breathtaking.  The
things upon the first floor become so much more clear, and visible.  The
upper floor is in somewhat of a disarray.  Papers are thrown about here and
there.  Many people are trying to clean up the mess, but the extent of it is
quite immense.  How could the palace become such a playground? 
Everyone up here seems to either be cleaning or sitting around doing nothing
-- kind of odd for an Emperor's palace.  One would think that they could find
something to do.

  The hall has come to an end here.  Before you lies a door of immense size.
It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut
right now, because it appears that Talsa is having a council right now. 
Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost
immediate death.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Bishop's Alcove
  The bishop's alcove is very similar to the rest of the church.  The
ceiling is rather low and gives the room a very close and compact feeling. 
Though no windows stand on the walls the room is provided with light from
two sources.  First and foremost there are four small oil lamps in each
corner of the room, additional light is provided by light pouring in from
the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive

After climbing through the trap door, you find yourself in a hallway.

Inside the Rebel Fortress
  The outside walls are covered with a thin layer of mold and other
plant life. But looking at the door, you can tell that it was just put
in, probably as a defense against the Empire's troops. You could
easily walk in because there are no guards present. It makes you wonder
that it probably isn't some big headquarters because otherwise it would be
more well guarded that this.

Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can
see.  A large breeze stirs the foot tall grass in beautiful waves.  The area
is cloaked in the shadow of the airship, and you notice some rope trailing
beneath the beast.  The palace of the Conadrains lies a few miles ahead as
these are the fields of the Prince himself!

Field Outside The House of The Rising Sun
  The land around here has been ravaged by many battles.  The rebellion is
always in a constant state of warfare.  You stand outside the House of The
Rising Sun, an inn notorious for being a rebellion hideout.  It is visited
by the scum of the earth, and the lowest creatures of the land.  The

However the rebellion has overrun it and turned it into a base of operations

floor has been torn and treaded upon for a long time.  It's amazing that any

Waiting Room
  The interior of the inn looks similar to most inns and tavern in the
land.  The owner obviously modeled it after some of the inns in Conadrain. 
However it appears to be lacking much of the maintenance that a place like
this requires.  Empty beer bottles and dinner plates are spewed across the
floor, many of them being entirely shattered or partially broken.  The floor
is also dotted with spilled beer stains and stains of vomit from people who
obviously had a tad too much to drink.  The particular part of the inn you are
in is really more a foyer for the entire room.  Here if the inn was having
an extremely busy day, guests could rest upon the couches on either side of
the room.  However the inn does not receive many busy days anymore, nor is
this room used for its original purpose, or so it appears.

  The view from the bowsprit is breathtaking.  You can see the horizon in
the far off distance.  Birds are flying and gliding all about the airship in
curiosity.  This of course has led to a problem, as the airship always
tends to attract birds, and well they do have bodily functions too.  The
swabs are always scraping the dung off the deck.  This part of this ship is
frequented by sailors for its excellent view of the surrounding area -- that
is when they get one of their rare breaks.

  From this foward part of the ship, you have a good vantage point of the
entire ship.  As you look towards the stern, you realize the immensity of
the ship.  Although your vision is somewhat impaired by people who are
walking about, you can just barely see the stern of the ship -- meaning that
the ship is a good eight, nine hundred feet long.  The technology that keeps
this up is terribly frightening.  If they can put a sea-born vessel in the
air, what is next?

  These quarters are lavishly decorated and furbished with the finest
items.  They are arranged about the area in the uniform fashion typical of
this airship.  This is, quite obviously, where the higher-ranking officers
spend much of their personal time.

The Captain of the Airship nods at you in agreement.
The Captain of the Airship says, "We'll go to Conadrain."

The Captain yells to the crew and the ship starts to fly.
After a few days of travel, you look below and see a field with cows and other livestock.
The Captain orders the crew to lower the ladder.

The Captain of the Airship says, "Okay, we'll be here until you want to go
 somewhere else."
The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can
see.  A large breeze stirs the foot tall grass in beautiful waves.  The area
is cloaked in the shadow of the airship, and you notice some rope trailing
beneath the beast.  The palace of the Conadrains lies a few miles ahead as
these are the fields of the Prince himself!

Pasture
  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller

  The large grassy fields part somewhat here.  The part of the field where

could grow on this ground for it has the looks of ground which has been
tread upon for hundreds of years.  Perhaps this path will take you to the
imperial palace.  Unfortunately you are not sure, and you would not want to
stray onto a path which did not lead to the palace.  Perhaps you should ask

She leaves as you enter the main hall, off to do some work.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

It stands some twelve feet tall and eight feet wide.  A giant could fit
through this door, it is so incredibly large.  The doors are quite shut
right now, because it appears that Talsa is having a council right now. 
Only his closest advisors may enter the chamber during a council.  Many of
the guards are trained to kill any man who might even be attempting to pass
these doors during a council.  Many have tried before now, however none have
survived their attempts.  Sometimes these councils can go on for several days
without any breaks in between.  The longest went on for two and half weeks,
when it was learned that the barbarians to the north of the Empire were
planning a massive assault upon the Empire.  To violate these chambers,
would be to violate the gods of this land and would result in almost
immediate death.

Council chamber
  The council chamber is immensely large.  The room is at least fifty feet
wide and fifty feet long, though the shape of it is rather odd.  The walls
move around to form a more oblong shape than anything else.  A grand
circular table sits in the middle of the room.  Several seats lie around it,
however one in particular is rather large.  That is likely where Talsa
generally sits.  The room is only lit by a single hole in the ceiling of the
palace.  During the day sun comes in through this hole to illuminate the
entire room in a fantastic way.  This however is somewhat limiting for at
night they have to lug in giant lamps to keep the room properly lit.  This
room keeps up with the rest of the splendor of this castle, it is truly an
amazing sight to behold.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

the holes in the wall in the bell tower which is just above you.  The room
lacks much furniture other than a small cot and a desk which is leaned up
against the right side of the room.  Only two objects lay upon the table, a
small feather pen and the bible of Maldenar.  The bible is a massive
seventy-four volume work compiled by Maldenar when he still lived.  Like

Inside the Rebel Fortress
  The outside walls are covered with a thin layer of mold and other
plant life. But looking at the door, you can tell that it was just put
in, probably as a defense against the Empire's troops. You could
easily walk in because there are no guards present. It makes you wonder
that it probably isn't some big headquarters because otherwise it would be
more well guarded that this.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You are standing in the middle of a vast field.  It would be a

immense size hovering overhead.  The beautiful flying work of art appears to
be a flying ship.  What's even more interesting, is there is a rope ladder
which hangs down from the side of the ship.  It's the perfect invitation for
you to enter.

The Captain orders the crew to lower the ladder.

The Captain of the Airship says, "Okay, we'll be here until you want to go
 somewhere else."
The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can
see.  A large breeze stirs the foot tall grass in beautiful waves.  The area
is cloaked in the shadow of the airship, and you notice some rope trailing
beneath the beast.  The palace of the Conadrains lies a few miles ahead as
these are the fields of the Prince himself!

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was

Palace Intersection
  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

  The stairs before you rise up in a magnificent way.  They spiral up around

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Classchange.
Help Category : Utility.
Related Helps : Primary Class, Rebuild, Subclass.
Last Updated  : 2023-07-15 12:05:01.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:

  classchange <password> <subclass> <race>
  classchange <password> <subclass> <race> [options] 
  classchange check
  classchange cancel

Options:
 
  noinstinct: Don't reset instinct.
  nomastery : Don't reset mastery.
  sameclass : Confirm when using classchange to rebuild instinct/mastery.

Summary:

This command is used to change your primary class, rebuild instinct and
rebuild masteries. It can be used free of charge every 7 days or at any
time at a cost of 1000QPs.

There is an FAQ at the end of this help file for how to do specific 
things such as change masteries or your main class only.

Type 'classchange check' to check the cost of a classchange.
Type 'classchange cancel' to back-out of the class changing process.

Detail:

Below are some important extra details about classchanges

* If your password contains a space, you will need to put single 
  quotes around it when using the classchange command: 
    classchange '<password>' <subclass> <race>.

* If you want to rebuild mastery or instinct only, classchange into 
  the same class. 

* If you choose a class that you have not yet remorted into, your 
  old primary class is completely removed and you will no longer have 
  access to those skills/ spells until you remort back into your former 
  class. If you already have the changed class, they simply swap. The
  game will return some practices based on the skills you lose during the
  classchange.

* The first class change on your character is free; subsequent class 
  changes are free every 7 days or at a cost of 1000QP if you don't want
  to wait.

You must type the classchange command twice to confirm the changes. If 
you change your mind or make a mistake, you can use 'classchange 
cancel' to back out.

Automatic rebuild:

Because of the emphasis on different stats in each class, when changing to
a new primary class, your character will automatically have stats reset as 
if you had used the rebuild command. Stats will need to be re-trained, and 
any tier/wish stats will need to be set again. This works the same way as a 
regular rebuild and does count as your first rebuild in the game.

Practiced amount in skills is not reset except for when you are losing 
access to a skill because it is class/subclass only. The game will 
return some practices when this is the case.

Frequently Asked Questions:
---------------------------

* How do I classchange only, leaving instinct and mastery in place?

   Example: classchange [password] avenger elf nomastery noinstinct

* How do I rebuild only masteries or only instinct?

    classchange [password] [current class] [currentrace] sameclass

  If you only want to do instinct *or* mastery, add 'noinstinct' or 
  'nomastery' option to exclude the other.

  You may also use the old mastery and instinct commands at a cost of 
  500qp. Refer to those helpfiles for more details.

* How can I change subclass only?

  Keep all other options other than subclass the same as they already are 
  and add the 'sameclass' option. For example, if you are an elf paladin-
  avenger and want to become an elf paladin-guardian:

    classchange [password] guardian elf sameclass

  Remember to add noinstinct and nomastery if you really want to change
  *only* subclass.

* How can I use this to change race only?

  Keep all options other than race the same as they already are and add
  the 'sameclass' option. For example, if you are an elf paladin-avenger 
  and want to become a vampire paladin-avenger:

    classchange [password] avenger vampire sameclass

  Remember to add noinstinct and nomastery if you really want to change
  *only* race.

Half-Griffons are a strange magical race created by a mad wizard. This
wizard loved griffons and had many as pets, but he was not able to teach
them anything since they were too wild to be tamed, so he decided to make
them more human-like. Half-Griffons are very rare, often taking up the
adventuring road to survive. Half-griffons are swift, agile, and quite
intelligent, thus being able to handle just about any class with ease. Their
unusual creation means half-griffons are less well put together than other
races and pay a penalty in their constitution and wisdom. Their agile minds
and familiarity with the air offers them protection against air and mental
attacks, but they should be wary of what a strong crushing blow can do to
their fragile hollow bones.

  You stand in a training field with wet and muddy grounds.
As you continue down the fields,you realize that 
this was once a battlefield of the worthy and ruthless
but it has now been swept and turned into a training
ground.
Apart from the worn paths and unpleasant pools of mud,
this field is still be used as a training center, and
an older man in a brown uniform who is as tough as
nails.

If you were looking for help on the Heal spell, see 'help heal spell'.

Syntax:  heal            : List heal options, keywords, and costs
         heal <keyword>  : Buy given healer option

The 'heal' command is used to interact with an in-room healer mobile, such
as the priestess north of recall.  Healers are able to sell healing and
curative spells, for a price.

Type 'heal' in a room with a healer mobile to find the charges for each
spell.  If there is no healer in the room you're in, you will be told such.

Type heal with the desired argument to purchase that spell.  It will be
cast only once; you may need to buy it again if it is unsuccessful.  Also,
note that some healers are more powerful than others.  If you are having
difficulty getting a successful casting, you may want to find a different
healer.  (Rumor has it that clan healers generally get more business and
are thus a bit more experienced than their counterparts out in the field.)

Healer mobiles will give out (for free) a few spells to players level 20
and under, if that player is willing to wait for them.  This is best
accomplished in rooms that do not have a lot of other traffic.

There is also a video which shows what to do at a healer on Aardwolf:

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

because you feel lost.  You look around you and see nothing but sand.  The
sun has fully risen and the heat is really getting to you.  You decide to
reach for your canteen as you feel yourself getting dehydrated.

A path heading east
  You start heading eastward and wonder if you made the right choice.  You
turn your head the other way but you cannot see anything.  The winds are
sweeping you towards the east.  As you look up to the sky you see the sun
rising.  You feel at peace as the rays hit your chest.  You look around in
amazement and then decide to move on.

  You are now heading toward the sunset.  As night comes forth, the air
begins to get cooler.  You realize that you have chosen the right path, away
from the hot desert heat.  After a while, you realize that it was only the
sun that was setting, and it had nothing to do with the path you took.  A
cold chill runs up your spine as you continue heading westward, still
pondering if this way is actually the best choice you could have made.

A path heading west
  After traveling many miles, you see some smoke rising from what seems to
be a village up ahead.  A question pops up in your head, and you ask
yourself, "What if this village contains savages and bloodthirsty
cannibals?"  You shudder at the thought, but what do you have to lose? 
You're lost in the middle of nowhere, without food or water.  Anything must
be better than what you're going through right now.  You get up all your
hopes and pray that Taji and his tribe will welcome you with kind hearts. 
You continue to head toward the village.

Into the Sunset Camp
  Finding yourself inside the Sunset Camp, you find yourself gazing in
amazement.  The place looks like an undeveloped culture from the outside but
now you notice it isn't.  You start to jog your memory as you remember that
you have heard about this camp before.  Remembering that many years ago a
sandstorm hit the world and covered everything in miles of sand, you realize
that you have uncovered the last camp.

Sunset Armor and Weapon Storage
  Arriving at the Blacksmith's shop, you can feel the heat against your
face as the blacksmith melts steel and shapes it into swords and axes.  The
sharp banging of hammer on hot steel tells you that the blacksmith is busy
making another weapon.  On the walls, weapons are hung up showing the
blacksmith's special skills in making weapons.  There is also a list of
prices for each of his weapons.

villagers from old to young, walking around.  You believe you have chosen
the right path and hope the guards will not interfere with you getting into
the village.  The guards look mean, ready to strike at any time.  You gather
up all your courage and try to walk right past the guards, pretending to be

A Sunrise Hut
  Entering a Sunrise hut, you admire its cleanliness.  As you move closer
you notice a mud mat in the middle of the hut.  You suppose it is hiding
something but you have no idea what.  Looking around you spot the mother who
is busily cleaning.  Deciding not to bother her, you move out of her way.

  Following the sun, you find yourself almost at the end of the path.  You
look up to see the sun rays penetrating your armor and filling your heart
with warmth.  This warmth stops the pain and you feel relieved.  But

are overwhelmed by it.  You have no idea how to stop the pain and look

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

There is a loud scream and a flare of light shoots towards the sky.
Below the flare, you hear Farringar scream 'HEAR ME, FOR I HAVE CONQUERED!'
As the light fades you realize a new superhero has been born.

Fantasizing
  Closing your eyes, you feel yourself being transported into a new world,
one of fantasies both good and bad.  The Fantasy Fields stretch in many
directions, encompassing visions of delight and horror.  Where you stand,
the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The star shudders, and then grants your wish.

happier day for this benighted realm.  Peasants trudge along this road,
scattering when they see you.  You wonder what great catastrophe could have
struck to make such a peaceful realm into a warzone.  Suddenly, you are
almost run down by a troop of horsemen who are galloping madly away from the
castle.  One of them calls to you as he passes, "Flee, neighbor, while you

A Long Hallway (2176)

A Long Hallway
  This is the west hall of Castle Caraway.  Torches in sconces line the
walls, casting a fitful light across the carpet.  The shadows reach up
across the ceiling, hiding any details from you, but you have the uneasy
feeling that something moved up there.  To the east lies the grand hall, and
there are closed doors to the north and south.

Sir Lauren's Room
  The room you have entered into reminds you of a prince's room.  Silk and
satin, all in shades of white and silver, cover practically every inch of
this bower of lordliness.  An armor stand rests in one corner, bare now of
the accouterments that once graced its form.  The bed is tastefully
decorated with a unicorn rampant counterpane, and the cherrywood frame is
carved delicately with scenes of unicorns and roses.

that this could never be your home sweet home.  A blast of heat from a
nearby pool of fire washes over you, and you hastily duck to avoid the hot
ashes that drift your way.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.
