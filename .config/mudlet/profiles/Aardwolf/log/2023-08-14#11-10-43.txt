from the plateau is severe, and looks like a quick exit from this life.

The Floating Temple
  This is the Floating Temple of Jupiter, the god of sky and thunder. A 
transparent tarp hangs above you, shading you from the sun. The tarp leaves 
the sky visible as a tribute to Jupiter. Several statues stand silently 
against the wall, judging you. The wall is decorated with a story of Jupiter.

[ Exits: south west ]
(Red Aura) A cleric blesses you in the name of Jupiter.
(Red Aura) (White Aura) A paladin of Jupiter bows his head in supplication.

The Floating Temple
  This is the Floating Temple of Jupiter, the god of sky and thunder. The 
temple is open to the sky so that supplicants can kneel and pray without 
anything blocking their access to the sky god. Mats are placed around the 
room so that believers can kneel when they pray. The walls are decorated with
the stories of Jupiter. The stairs to the rear of the temple lead upwards to 
the Council Chambers. It is said that the Council makes you pass through the 
temple to remind you of humility before coming before them. A small man-sized
hole is in the floor.

In the air
  You are flying through the air. Clouds pass by you, and birds swerve to avoid
you. The temple is above you, and the valley is just below you. People move 
about down below, and look like ants from this height. Hawklords fly beside 
you, flying down to the valley for fun and dares. The odd air currents in the
valley can make for some acrobatic flying. The air currents prevent you from 
flying further upwards.

[ Exits: up down ]
(Red Aura) A hawklord levitates himself in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Path before the Gate
  You stand on a wide, well-worn path that leads away to the west and
toward a distant forest of tall blackpines.  All around you is silence.  No
birds sing, no insects chirp; even the wind is still.  Perhaps it is the
presence of the Black Tower that stands before you to the south.  A large
black gate blocks the path directly to the south, and unless you carry the
key, you can go no further in this direction.  Perhaps it is just as well;
this place looks nasty!

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on a wide, well-worn path that leads away to the west and
toward a distant forest of tall blackpines.  All around you is silence.  No
birds sing, no insects chirp; even the wind is still.  Perhaps it is the
presence of the Black Tower that stands before you to the south.  A large
black gate blocks the path directly to the south, and unless you carry the
key, you can go no further in this direction.  Perhaps it is just as well;
this place looks nasty!

The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Help Keywords : Socials.
Help Category : Communication.
Related Helps : Emote, New Social, Rsocial, Shelp.
Last Updated  : 2020-03-25 19:59:29.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:

    socials                  : Displays all socials.
    socials <string>         : Displays socials with given string.
    random                   : Uses a random social.


Summary:

Type 'socials' to get a list. 
Type a social name to use it. 
Type 'social [target]' to use a social on someone else.
Type 'gossip *smile' to use the smile social on the gossip channel.

Detail:

Socials are a pre-set list of various actions that may either have no 
target (*nod = "You nod.") or target yourself or another player/monster
(*nod ivar  = "You nod at Ivar."). 

To see a complete list of socials, type 'socials'.  To search the socials
file for a specific word, use 'socials <word>'.  To see the specific
actions a specific social will do, use 'shelp <social>' (see 'help shelp').

You may also use 'random' instead of a specific social to use a random
social from the list.

For information on how to use socials on channels, see 'help channels'.

If a game command and a social overlap (e.g., 'poker' command vs. 'poke'
social), prefix the social with a * (like '*poke ivar').

Note: Curse-only socials (see 'help nocurse') will only work on channels;
they do not work in rooms.

The 'strictsocials' command sets your character so that you have to use the
'*' prefix to social someone. This is to help reduce the number of socials 
caused by typos. The current 'strictsocials' setting can be seen by typing 
'config all'.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.
     An old electric heater.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Before the Wayward Alehouse
  Just off the path through the desolate pridelands of Abend, the dark 
continent, the only building within sight stands before you. The walls appear
to be constructed of a hardy wood, though they have not aged particularly 
well, and have several patches of weather-related damage throughout the 
visible section. The building is somewhat dark, though a steady hum of many 
intermixed noises can be heard through the walls. Directly in front of you is
a simple wooden door with a splintered surface and a dull grey doorknob.
Hanging above the door is a sign signifying what this building is. It's the 
Wayward Alehouse! The gravel path under you extends to the west and to the 
east.

On the dance floor
  The dance floor here is separated from the main area of the bar by a chest 
high wooden railing. The railing is rife with scratches and gouges from 
either fingernails or possible weapons which missed their intended targets.
A ruckus of what can vaguely be described as music travels through the air, 
possibly tempting some to dance, and others to run and cover their ears. The 
dance floor extends in all directions, except for to the east.

On the dance floor
  The wooden floor here clops dully with every step, yet provides adequate grip
for the fleet footed. You are surrounded on all sides by dance floor, save 
for the west, which is a wall of the Alehouse, adorned with various decor, 
including a coat of arms, and what appears to be a goat skull. Looking down 
at the floor, one would see a few spots of brown darker than the rest of the 
fairly light-colored floor...possibly a defect in the wood, possibly the 
failed attempts of cleaning up some spilled blood.

  You are on the main walk of the Alehouse, against the western wall and 
between an exit from the dance floor and the band stand, a very highly 
trafficked area. A decorative lute hangs on a hook on the wall. Standing 
here, the sounds produced from the band are almost too much to bear. It would
appear the band to the north has been instructed to play as loudly as they 
possibly can, and they are happy to oblige.

On the dance floor
  You are on what passes in the Alehouse for a dance floor. Really, it is more 
of a large, open space, which could potentially be used for dancing, as well 
as other artistic performances such as music playing, or possibly fighting.
The floor here is solid wood, though it appears a little better kept than the
wooden floors of the bar area in the Alehouse, as these floors are waxed and 
polished, and actually do serve pretty well as a dance floor. The dance floor
continues to the north and to the west, and the main entrance of the Alehouse
is to the east. South, you can see a grubby window with a view outside.

In the threshold of the Alehouse
  You are in the threshold of the Wayward Alehouse. The scent of smoke mixed 
with alcohol hits your nose as do the sights of this establishment. The floor
beneath you is entirely made of wood with no carpeting to speak of. Boots 
make quite a distinct thud when coming into contact with the old wood that 
makes up the floor of this building. Off to the east are the coat room and a 
staircase leading to the second floor. To the north, there the Alehouse 
extends, and you can see a bar off in the distance. The noise in here is 
quite elevated. Between the buzzing of conversation, the occasional battle 
cry, and a band off in the far corner playing "music," it can be difficult to
even hear one's own thoughts. To the west, a large open space with no tables 
or chairs to speak of.  The exit is back to the south.

Coat (Armor) Check
  This is the coat room of the Wayward Alehouse. Patrons are encouraged to 
leave their unnecessary outer garments in this room for safekeeping while 
they enjoy the festivities of the bar area. "Coat" room is not entirely 
correct, as there are not many coats here, but rather pieces of armor.
Hanging on the walls, pieces of armor range from the simplest of hide tunics 
to steel breastplates, to horned battle helmets. There is a window giving a 
rather drab view of the path around the Alehouse. There is also a weapons 
rack, though it is oddly empty. A staircase extends northward to the second 
floor, and the only other obvious exit is back to the Alehouse proper.

In the threshold of the Alehouse
  You are in the threshold of the Wayward Alehouse. The scent of smoke mixed 
with alcohol hits your nose as do the sights of this establishment. The floor
beneath you is entirely made of wood with no carpeting to speak of. Boots 
make quite a distinct thud when coming into contact with the old wood that 
makes up the floor of this building. Off to the east are the coat room and a 
staircase leading to the second floor. To the north, there the Alehouse 
extends, and you can see a bar off in the distance. The noise in here is 
quite elevated. Between the buzzing of conversation, the occasional battle 
cry, and a band off in the far corner playing "music," it can be difficult to
even hear one's own thoughts. To the west, a large open space with no tables 
or chairs to speak of.  The exit is back to the south.

  You are almost in the middle of the Alehouse. The reverberations of chatter 
and terrible music fill the air, as do the haze of smoke and the pungent 
fumes of alcohol. The wooden floor creaks beneath the weight of patrons, 
though the sound is hardly noticeable over the constant buzz of social life.
It would appear the adventurers who have made it out to the Alehouse see it 
right to enjoy themselves. The main walk of the Alehouse extends north 
towards the bar and south towards the exit. There is a table to the east, and
the dance floor can be seen past a railing to the west.

At a table
  You now stand before a table in the Wayward Alehouse. The table is circular, 
and made of wood, and is surrounded by four chairs arranged approximately a 
quarter of the way around the table each. There is a window in the wall to 
the east, providing a view of the horse pasture outside of the Alehouse. The 
ceiling towards the south slopes slightly, making room for the stairs 
directly above you that lead to the second floor. To the north sits another 
table.

In the Alehouse
  You are halfway between the bar and the exit of the Wayward Alehouse. The 
music here is fairly loud, though not unbearably so. To the east, there are 
patrons occupying tables, and to the west the dance floor is separated from 
you by a simple wooden railing. The bar is to the north, and the exit of the 
Alehouse to the south. The floor here is slightly uneven, perhaps warranting 
further inspection.

In the Alehouse
  You are in the Alehouse between the bar and the dance floor, just west of the
main walk. A railing separates you from the dance floor, which is probably a 
good thing as the railing also separates you from any potential brawling the 
may break out in the wide open space to your south. The haze of cigars and 
tobacco pipes hangs in the air, stagnant and dense. The bar is directly to 
your north.

between an exit from the dance floor and the band stand, a very highly

here, the sounds produced from the band are almost too much to bear. It would
appear the band to the north has been instructed to play as loudly as they 
possibly can, and they are happy to oblige.

  The northeastern most corner of the dance floor is blocked off from the main

the more eccentric dancers (or brawlers, reasonably) from spilling out of the
dance floor and into the bar itself. From this section of the floor, one is 
provided with a clear view of the bar, as well as of tables against the east 
wall of the Alehouse, and any patrons who might be occupying them. The dance

On the dance floor
  The dance floor here is separated from the main area of the bar by a chest 
high wooden railing. The railing is rife with scratches and gouges from 
either fingernails or possible weapons which missed their intended targets.
A ruckus of what can vaguely be described as music travels through the air, 
possibly tempting some to dance, and others to run and cover their ears. The 
dance floor extends in all directions, except for to the east.

for the west, which is a wall of the Alehouse, adorned with various decor, 
including a coat of arms, and what appears to be a goat skull. Looking down 
at the floor, one would see a few spots of brown darker than the rest of the 
fairly light-colored floor...possibly a defect in the wood, possibly the 
failed attempts of cleaning up some spilled blood.

In the threshold of the Alehouse
  You are in the threshold of the Wayward Alehouse. The scent of smoke mixed 
with alcohol hits your nose as do the sights of this establishment. The floor
beneath you is entirely made of wood with no carpeting to speak of. Boots 
make quite a distinct thud when coming into contact with the old wood that 
makes up the floor of this building. Off to the east are the coat room and a 
staircase leading to the second floor. To the north, there the Alehouse 
extends, and you can see a bar off in the distance. The noise in here is 
quite elevated. Between the buzzing of conversation, the occasional battle 
cry, and a band off in the far corner playing "music," it can be difficult to
even hear one's own thoughts. To the west, a large open space with no tables 
or chairs to speak of.  The exit is back to the south.

An Alehouse server rushes by, nearly bumping into you as she takes a drink to a patron.

gotten snagged on his line! The lady dwarf ran over when she saw the hungry, grumpy, cynical dwarf. 
She gave him a tickling kiss on his weathered cheek, and suddenly he wasn't grumpy or cynical any

In the Alehouse
  You are almost in the middle of the Alehouse. The reverberations of chatter 
and terrible music fill the air, as do the haze of smoke and the pungent 
fumes of alcohol. The wooden floor creaks beneath the weight of patrons, 
though the sound is hardly noticeable over the constant buzz of social life.
It would appear the adventurers who have made it out to the Alehouse see it 
right to enjoy themselves. The main walk of the Alehouse extends north 
towards the bar and south towards the exit. There is a table to the east, and
the dance floor can be seen past a railing to the west.

In the threshold of the Alehouse
  You are in the threshold of the Wayward Alehouse. The scent of smoke mixed 
with alcohol hits your nose as do the sights of this establishment. The floor
beneath you is entirely made of wood with no carpeting to speak of. Boots 
make quite a distinct thud when coming into contact with the old wood that 
makes up the floor of this building. Off to the east are the coat room and a 
staircase leading to the second floor. To the north, there the Alehouse 
extends, and you can see a bar off in the distance. The noise in here is 
quite elevated. Between the buzzing of conversation, the occasional battle 
cry, and a band off in the far corner playing "music," it can be difficult to
even hear one's own thoughts. To the west, a large open space with no tables 
or chairs to speak of.  The exit is back to the south.

  You are on what passes in the Alehouse for a dance floor. Really, it is more 
of a large, open space, which could potentially be used for dancing, as well 
as other artistic performances such as music playing, or possibly fighting.
The floor here is solid wood, though it appears a little better kept than the
wooden floors of the bar area in the Alehouse, as these floors are waxed and 
polished, and actually do serve pretty well as a dance floor. The dance floor
continues to the north and to the west, and the main entrance of the Alehouse
is to the east. South, you can see a grubby window with a view outside.

  The dance floor here is separated from the main area of the bar by a chest

either fingernails or possible weapons which missed their intended targets.
A ruckus of what can vaguely be described as music travels through the air, 
possibly tempting some to dance, and others to run and cover their ears. The

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Syntax: cast 'portal' <player>
Spell Number: 92

This spell opens a magic portal to your victim. You can use 'enter portal'
(see 'help enter') to transport yourself to the room your portal leads to.
The portal spell is one-way only.  The portal will remain open for a fixed
period of time, dependent on the caster's level and the strength of the
spell.

Note that you cannot create portals in some rooms, and some rooms cannot be
targets of portals.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

the gate is a long iron fence disguised by dark green leafy shrubs, giving it
the natural appearance of a simple hedge at first glance. On the other side 
of the gate is a path of small white stones, which leads directly to an 
enormous bluestone manor situated in the middle of a vast, sprawling estate.

the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and

Grand hall
  A long hall stretches out before you, with access to the east and west wings 
of the manor. The solid marble floor is covered with a deep, rich red carpet 
runner, which muffles your footsteps. Archways to the east and west are 
framed by velvet drapes that match the ones on the windows. Portraits of the 
Earl's family, going back many generations, line the walls of the grand hall.
Beneath each picture are some words about the subject above. Between each 
picture are pillars of candles, elegantly displayed in wrought iron 
candelabras. As you walk through the hall, you get the feeling you are being 
watched, though the household staff are not paying you any special attention.

slowly roasting. The flesh is sizzling in the heat of the flames, sending 
forth mouth-watering aromas that waft around the kitchen. Pots of water sit 
on the stove, simmering away and cooking the vegetables within. A large 
square table occupies the middle of the room covered with kitchen utensils, 
chopping blocks, knives, bowls and plates. Partially chopped vegetables are 
heaped in the bowls and the scraps are waiting to be thrown in the rubbish.

The grasses are dotted very occasionally with small pink wildflowers, though 
care is taken to keep the flowers out of the grass. In the distance you can

manor speaks of wealth; old and timeless wealth. The floor is made from a 
white and black marble, inlaid with gold veins and specks. A deep, rich red 
carpet runner extends down the length of the main hall from the other side of
the foyer. Solid, polished wooden pedestals stand on either side of the front
doors, and hold a large antique vase each, which are many centuries old.
Long glass windows, framed by thick velvet curtains, allow plenty of 
sunlight to filter in. The occasional guard can be seen patrolling the

Path around the manor
  The path divides here from its endless loop around the manor. To the east you
can see a temple surrounded by a garden. It has a tall steeple which casts a 
long shadow on the ground. There is some activity to the east as a group of 
people enter the temple, closing the door behind them. The white stone path 
continues to the north and south, around the manor.

Path around the manor
  The white stones crunch underfoot, shifting slightly under the weight of your
body. The path continues to the north and south in its endless journey around
the large manor. To the west the path branches off, heading towards some 
buildings in the distance. To the east, the imposing manor looms over you, 
its many windows staring sightlessly outwards. A white trellis, supporting a 
flowering wisteria vine, leans up against a portion of the wall, rising up to
the eaves high above.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a

  Hideous gargoyles, screaming in eternal silence, are guarding the entrance to
the manor from a high perch above, and to either side of, the iron lined, 
wooden double doors. Five wide bluestone steps lead up to a tiled landing 
before the door, which is sheltered by an overhanging eave. On either side of
the door is a potted lemon tree, well pruned and cared for. To the east and 
west a path made from small white stones seems to lead around the manor.

  There are many doors along the hallway of the west wing of the manor. One 
wooden door to the north is slightly ajar and a wisp of smoke emerges from 
the room within, carrying with it the scent of tobacco. There is a large set 
of double doors in the south wall that catches your attention and is probably
worth a closer look. At the far end of the hallway is a single door that has 
carvings of roses in the panelling. Large chandeliers light up the wing with 
hundreds of candles, which are never allowed to burn out. Small tables 
adorned with vases and figurines are placed between the doors along the walls.
Paintings and tapestries adorn the walls above the small tables and their

all four walls, filling the spaces between the windows as well. The shelves 
reach as high as the ceiling and there are wooden ladders on rails to access

with leather clad chairs for reading. A fire is crackling in the fireplace in
the western wall, safely hiding behind an iron wrought grate with the Earl's 
coat of arms on it. Large potted plants stand at the end of the shorter 
bookshelves and a stray ladybird crawls along one of the leaves.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

A dark forest
  Wandering through the forest was a bad idea. Not only is it cold and wet, but
also unnaturally dark. Regardless of the time of day, the forest stays the 
same brightness. Even the sounds of the forest have been muffled by some 
unseen force. The remains of an animal trail loop and twist around, 
eventually extending out of sight.

(Hidden) (Golden Aura) (White Aura) An unusually large firefly is here, and it appears to be
watching you.
(Red Aura) A kobold shaman hides in the underbrush, waiting for an ally.
 
As you enter, you see a kobold dive into some bushes and wait for you to leave.

Cages hang from giant trees of the forest to the north and the west, each

  This cage is more in the forest than it is in the camp. It dangles 
precariously from a giant tree, at the mercy of the environment. The sounds 
from the camp are dulled by the distance; however the eerie quiet from the 
white tent to the south is unnerving. Considering how many magical creatures 
are in and around the cage, there is a surprising lack of magical energy 
here.

A rarely used path
  Being off of the main path in the camp, this path is clearly barely used.
Cages hang from giant trees of the forest to the north and the west, each 
containing eldar prisoners. The white walls of the tent to the south flap in 
the forest breeze, as they have not been reinforced like the other tents. A 
strange totem in the center of the path feels like it is drawing magical 
energy from the surrounding area.

almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A path through the camp
  The muddy ground has been trodden by countless kobolds running errands for 
their officers. The forest to the west has been cut back to accommodate the 
tents required to run the siege. The camp runs from the north to the south, 
with tents all along the main path. Unlike the western gates to the camp, the
eastern gate has been well-maintained and is under constant guard. The path 
leading east out of the camp is almost as worn as the main path. The only 
permanent structure, a one-room building made of wood and clay, lies to the 
west.

platforms are built into each of the four endings of both walls, manned by 
kobolds armed with deadly ranged weapons.

  Mud, clay, gore, and other unrecognizable substances make footing

  There is no escape from the battle that rages around this area of the field.
Kobolds are being struck down by unseen forces all around, while they 
continue to fight against the castle. The insanity of the siege is fully 
realized, as each kobold that falls in the field is quickly replaced by two 
more from the west. Logic dictates the kobolds numbers must be dwindling, 
however they continue to stream from the camp to assault the Eldar. Having 
the trees brutally removed by the kobolds to create this field, there is no 
escaping the brutality of the battlefield.

  Gore and grime have splattered the barrier wall that protects any direct 
assault against the camp. However, this barrier feels more like a hindrance 
to the kobolds' cause than it does protect them from the Eldar. The 
innumerable kobolds that have streamed from the camp have created a 'V' in 
the mud, with natural berms preserving the surviving plants. In the crux of 
the 'V', a tent stands hidden amongst the muck and mud. Sounds of assault come

  Approaching the southwest corner of the castle reveals extensive damage and

wall opposite the path. Innumerable feet have pounded a path of hard dirt to 
the north and south, the latter rounding to the east, around the corner of

  The western barricade that separates the camp from the battleground ends
abruptly far short of the north edge of the battlegrounds.  Any movement
toward the camp itself is stymied by the dense forest that wraps around the
northwestern corner of this field. The kobolds must have decided the

the clear-cutting has completely stopped in this corner. They were either 
confident or lazy, but definitely one of the two.

  As the light from the entrance fades to the west, the smells from the north 
and east rise.  They're not good odors. The musty smell wafting from the 
north suggests the tunnel is not used very often, while the moldy smell 
coming from the east could mean some sort of water source. The two directions 
are not as inviting as returning west and finding a way out of the horrible

  The tunnel recedes to the south, collapsing into darkness. Twin beams have 
been built to the north, east, and west, creating a respite to the endless 
darkness. Rock walls block any exit to these directions. The southern exit 
has beams, but they were much more hastily constructed than the others. The 
southern exit still shows promise of an exit to the tunnels, a hint of light 
extending to parts unknown. A tiny green glint in the ceiling is the only 
color in the entire tunnel. Walls keep the kobolds from digging to the 
extraneous directions, suggesting any exit to the freedom does not lie above.

cutting off the light from the south, while allowing hints of light to come

darkness, suggesting safety can be found there. A slight cool breeze can 
be felt coming from the east, while the stifling heat of the musty tunnels

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.
