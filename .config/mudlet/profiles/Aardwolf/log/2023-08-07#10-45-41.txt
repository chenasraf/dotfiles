Boot Clan Public Hall (G)
  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance. 

Type 'North' to begin your journey...

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  Definitely not much to look at, this one-room shack is nonetheless

one has to duck to enter, and only some ragged blankets to provide comfort,
it does have one precious advantage- it's a place to hide from those that
would do its occupant harm.  And there are many, many of those.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

>>    The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

>>    Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Plaza Gates
  Almost as formidable as the gates at the City's entrance, these protect
Pandemonium's nobility from invasion of their elite sanctum.  The road
slopes upward sharply, as if discouraging would-be treaders, and the City
Guard stationed at the gate itself looks none too friendly.

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...

Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic

  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall

as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

A Beauteous Courtyard
  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...

decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic

>>    The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

A Beauteous Courtyard
  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...

  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

  The labyrinth continues.  A blast of strong wind whistles through the

an eerie scream as it blows through the maze, a high-pitched wail that could
be mistaken for humanoid in origin.  Blood coats the thorns lining the
hedges, left there by creatures desperate for any anchor in the eye-watering
wind.  It will be a fight against the gale to make one's way either north or

The lobby (G)
  The sheer size of the theatre's lobby is breathtaking. Tall marble
columns support the ornately carved dome ceiling, and the walls are adorned
with playbills from previous and future shows. This is where the crowds
gather before the show, and where they wait out intermissions with lively
discussions. The continuous low, humming drone of conversation is 
occasionally punctuated by loud, boisterous laughter coming from the large
group of people congregating near the entryway. On the southern side of the
room stands a towering pair of arched double-doors leading into the
theatre. Ushers stand ready, programs in hand, to show you to your seat.

the line, each of whom walk away sniffing some unusual and obviously foreign
delicacy.  The only delicacy you can even guess at seems to be a little
carton full of what looks like cheese.  Moving ahead, you can see more of
the back of the stand, in which lies two barrels, which are constantly
making noise which can even be heard over the chatter of the customers.  You
look into the cup of a passing, just-served customer and see that the liquid
is cherry-colored.  The liquid is bubbly and noisy.  In a far corner of the
stand, you see some rocks hopping up and down all by themselves!  In the
other far corner, you see a metal vat, the contents of which are out of your
sight, but you guess is the same as that which lies about it, a
yellow-orange pudding!  As the customer in front of you moves away, you

the piece.  This entire room glows with an otherworldly light, originating
from behind the towering throne.  Your hair stands on end as you realize
that the attention of every creature in the room has suddenly turned on you.

[ Exits: north east (south) west ]
(Red Aura) (White Aura) The King leans over to hear whispered advice as you approach.
(Red Aura) A member of the royal guard is here to protect the King. Wow! He's *REALLY* big!

Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:

Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The northeast corner of the Grand Plaza is dominated by the Clerics'
Guild--The Tower of Life--to the north and the smallest of the eight
towers--The Helpers' Headquarters--to the east.  Vines budding with a
variety of flowers wind their way up the Clerics' tower, each blossom alive
with vibrant color.  The Helper building is the most understated of all
those lining the Grand Plaza, and yet it completes the symmetry of the
square perfectly.  The so-called Eighth Tower is overlooked by many, but all
would miss it if it were gone.  Vendors here shout advertisements for a
variety of exotic curatives, claiming to soothe every ill from a runny nose
to Nanjiki jungle rot.  Guards flank the entrances to the Guilds, letting
only the worthy pass.

  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The lobby (G)
  The sheer size of the theatre's lobby is breathtaking. Tall marble
columns support the ornately carved dome ceiling, and the walls are adorned
with playbills from previous and future shows. This is where the crowds
gather before the show, and where they wait out intermissions with lively
discussions. The continuous low, humming drone of conversation is 
occasionally punctuated by loud, boisterous laughter coming from the large
group of people congregating near the entryway. On the southern side of the
room stands a towering pair of arched double-doors leading into the
theatre. Ushers stand ready, programs in hand, to show you to your seat.

lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the

dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

Syntax: Precision

A well practiced soldier can focus on the precision of their attacks to the 
point that some of their strikes will be impossible to dodge while they are 
affected by precision. 

During combat, the chance of precision triggering on any specific swing is
based on str/dex of the attacker vs that of the target. When fighting other 
players, Precision only works on the Warrior class dodges that the Soldier 
deeply understands. For example, Precision will not prevent a Mage player
from 'blinking' to avoid an attack, but does still work against mobs.

Training precision instinct will slowly increase the number of hits that
can't be dodged.

The duration of the precision effect is based on dex and str. 

Skill available only to the Soldier Warrior Subclass.

  Rounding a hill of slag, you stumble into a large hidden gully. High rock 
walls hide this place from the surrounding area, making it a great place to 
hide, but a bad place to be trapped.

The Crack Expands
  Working your way down deeper into the crack, you gain some breathing room
as the space opens up and levels off into the darkness.  Is this space a
random arrangement of rock?  Or does it include an element of design?  You
note the beautiful moss growing on the walls.

  This is turning into one hell of a crack.  Indeed, you begin to wonder if
you are not in a cavern or grotto.  Might there be inhabitants here?  It is

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

  Sweet perfume wafts with every movement here, enticing and tantalizing. 
Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic

Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

The Blood Swamps
  The vegetation here is odd.  All the plants seem to have a slight reddish
tint to them, no doubt due to the red dust which permeates this land.  Even
the water here has a sickly crimson color, polluted by the high iron content
of this entire continent, thus giving birth to the name the Blood Swamps. 
Loud cackles can be heard coming from east of here, where a blood red strata
of rock rises from the swamp and into the heavens.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

Inside the Main Courtyard of the Castle
  The courtyard continues further into the castle.  The flagstones
themselves are quarried from a black stone, polished by the passing of time
and booted feet into an inky sheen.  All around the courtyard, demons roam,
going about their business, talking in their guttural rasping tongue.  All
manner of dread abomination walks, slithers and crawls; their forms a
corruption of many different creatures, twisted together into a mocking
semblance of their former lives.  All around the edges of the courtyard,
large archways vault upwards, calling you into their maw.

dim shapes with vaguely human forms walking and chuckling at the occasional
screaming echoing out of the mist, or the black tower that rises far to your

back into a rough wooden post and pray to your deity not to be seen.  South

  The view from the top of this guard tower offers an unrivalled vision of
the scene below.  For a second, your breath catches in your throat, as you
realise the sheer numbers of demons that crawl upon the flagstones, like
ants below you.  To think that this Valkur must be raising an army is no
idle speculation now.  And judging by the way that you have seen them train,
wherever their sights are set should be very afraid...  In your heart, you
utter a silent prayer of warding to your friends and loved ones, hoping that
it might have an affect.

  The black stone crenelations of the castle wall jut out like fangs from
a toothy jaw, half obscured and made more demonic by the dark mist that
floats all around the castle sounding into the darkening mists, half

  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

  A spiral staircase funnels a throng of shoppers in and out of the mall to
shops which populate this floor. Bards and other folks mingle in the open
portions of the plaza. The constant drone of crowds is occasionally
punctuated with a louder twang of an off-key instrument. Fewer people
climb the spiral leading up to the next level of the hall. Pale statuary
is just visible between the uppermost balusters.

The Silver Moon - Musical Supplies and Other Useful Things (G)
  The scent of fir swirls through the air from an alcove where a tree
grows.  Shelves containing all manner of items used to make music are lining
the room.  Various instrument cases of all shapes and sizes rest against the
walls below the shelves.  Taliesin sits in a chair, playing his harp.  He
calls out "Diarmund, Grianne, would you bring me some more light, children?"
A rustling in the fir trees draws your eyes, and two owls emerge and fly
over to Taliesin's upturned palms.  A rainbow of light leaps from his head
and surrounds the owls and his hands, then disappears, leaving only a
glowing ball within them.  As Taliesin shifts the position of his chair to
better use the light, the two owls settle on a stand near him.  Taliesin
radiates gentleness and kindness as he states, "We always have time for the
young, don't we Diarmund and Grianne?  Come in and be welcome."  The two
owls look at each other and nod.

Up the central stairwell (G)
  A spiral staircase funnels a throng of shoppers in and out of the mall to
shops which populate this floor. Bards and other folks mingle in the open
portions of the plaza. The constant drone of crowds is occasionally
punctuated with a louder twang of an off-key instrument. Fewer people
climb the spiral leading up to the next level of the hall. Pale statuary
is just visible between the uppermost balusters.

The Closet of Outfits (G)
  Rarely in your life have you seen a room with such colour!  Reds and
greens assault your eyes, mixed with yellows, blues, and almost evey other
shade in the spectrum.  Gaily coloured paintings adorn the walls, clashing
with the rugs strewn across the floor.  What holds your attention, though,
are the costumes.  Rack upon rack of them stand here, filled with clothing
and props from all walks of life the fevered imaginings of some demented
tailor.  A skilled Bard could become any person he chose whithin minutes in
this wonderous room.  A caveman, a warrior, a vagabond, a cow!  The large
oaken counter is draped with a many-coloured cloth, the Bard's trademark. 
As you approach, you think to yourself exactly what manner of man or beast
you wish to appear as today....

>>    The Music Box (G)
  The room you have entered is unlike any you have seen before.  The golden
light from a set of bronze lanterns suspended from the ceiling reflects off
of hundreds of the highest quality musical instruments hung from the walls,
from the most exotic to the most mundane, shining gold or silver or with the
dull sheen of leather.  The southernmost wall is hung not with instruments
but with hundreds of pages of sheet music of a thousand different styles and
authorships.  As you enter and begin looking about, a middle aged woman with
a swath of silver hair that falls past her waist emerges from a previously
unseen backroom.  Although she is dressed in the robes of a priest or
magician, the calluses on her hands are those of a long time musician.  "How
many I be of services to ye?"  She inquires in a soft, melodic voice.

shops which populate this floor. Bards and other folks mingle in the open

The central stairwell (G)
  This central location in the tower is brightly lit, though you do not
see any light source. A spiral staircase makes its way up to the landing,
before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through
the halls, much of it going to the shops on the next floor. Shadows flicker
lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the
south.

  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.
 
There is a brightly-colored poster here.

marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

The Grand Plaza
  The northeast corner of the Grand Plaza is dominated by the Clerics'
Guild--The Tower of Life--to the north and the smallest of the eight
towers--The Helpers' Headquarters--to the east.  Vines budding with a
variety of flowers wind their way up the Clerics' tower, each blossom alive
with vibrant color.  The Helper building is the most understated of all
those lining the Grand Plaza, and yet it completes the symmetry of the
square perfectly.  The so-called Eighth Tower is overlooked by many, but all
would miss it if it were gone.  Vendors here shout advertisements for a
variety of exotic curatives, claiming to soothe every ill from a runny nose
to Nanjiki jungle rot.  Guards flank the entrances to the Guilds, letting
only the worthy pass.

  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

Wandering along a dirt path (1243)

Wandering along a dirt path
  You continue along the dirt path in western Sargasso, and the random
arrangement of tents continues all around you.  The settlement wall (if you
can call it that) lies a little ways to the north, but there are so many
rocks in the way that proceeding farther in that direction would be
impossible.  The wind picks up again and you choke and gag as you inhale
some of the horrid dust-stuff.  Muttering something about stupid mining
settlements, you decide to put up with the wind and simply press onwards. 
The large tent to the west looks rather safe compared with the hot wind and
dust you have to deal with outside.

some of the horrid dust-stuff.  Muttering something about stupid mining
settlements, you decide to put up with the wind and simply press onwards. 
The large tent to the west looks rather safe compared with the hot wind and
dust you have to deal with outside.

Wandering along a dirt path (1286)

Inside Sargasso's gate (1285)

Approaching a small mine shaft
  After having spent some time in the dirty, run down settlement of
Sargasso, you realize that the only thing the prospectors have is mining. 
They left their families and decided to dedicate themselves to one single
task.  The wind starts to pick up a little and the weird dirt-stuff flies
around for a little bit, but the gusts are not nearly as horrible as when
you were walking upon the mountain.  Still, the smell of charred flesh,
which was absent to the north, lingers on here.  What could these miners be
doing to paint such a horrid picture of the town?  You shrug off the
question, thinking it could not possibly be on purpose.  To the west you see
a beautifully colored hut and wonder why something so vibrant would be in a
place of such death and misery.

Inside a small mine shaft
  Rotting oak posts support the ceiling of this very old looking mine
shaft.  You find this to be very strange, because all the other clues point
to the fact that Sargasso is a relatively new settlement.  How odd.  Maybe
there's something more to the mineshaft ...  something beautiful, yet
forgotten for countless ages.  The upper level of the mine shaft continues
south of here, or you can explore the depths of the mine below.

Exploring underground
  This mine shaft is certainly much bigger than you thought it would be! 
It appears that the Sargasso miners certainly found a bit more than ore when
they dug deep inside the ground.  The underground caverns seem almost
endless, and you can't help but notice that they seem to be very ancient,
unlike the relatively new mine shaft.  You can climb back up the rope to the
mining settlement, but you get the feeling that it would be much nicer to
explore underground instead.  Paths spiral off in each direction, and you
really don't know which would be the best way to go.  Tiny little runes are
carved inside one of the cavern's walls in runny black ink.  Maybe coming to
Sargasso wasn't such a huge waste after all.

Exploring underground
  This portion of the underground world leads due west, unlike the rest of the 
supposed mine shaft, which meanders about seemingly without purpose.
Stalactites hang precariously from the ceiling, and if you aren't careful one
might plummet towards the ground and split your skull open like the way a 
farmer's axe slaughters a cow. Shuddering at the gruesome simile, you try to 
stay a good distance away from the more unstable of the cavern's many 
stalactites. You can't help but marvel at the way the straightness of the 
tunnel and the abundance of stalactites seem to be very deliberate, almost as
if someone made this part of the underground tunnel. The only way to find out
for sure is to continue west. Scuff marks and blood stains, as well as mining
tools lying forgotten on the ground show that some sort of a struggle here 
and recently. The opening to the west has been partially blocked by a 
cave-in, but it might be possible to squeeze through and see what is on the 
other side.

  As you continue due west through the tunnel, you notice that the
stalactite trap has disappeared completely.  You whistle to yourself as you
trot along without a care in the world, when suddenly a gaping hole opens up
in front your feet!  Scrambling not to fall in, you barely manage to avoid
what could have been a very messy situation.  One of the rocks you knocked
over in your attempt to flee from the maw falls down the hole, but you don't
hear the satisfying "crack" of stone striking stone.  All you hear is the
deafening silence of a suffocating cavern and your heart pounding in your
throat, sending your body into minor convulsions.  Seeing no other way out,
you turn around to leave, but the way east seems to have mysteriously
vanished, almost as if it was never there to begin with, that it was all a
dream ...
 
You have no choice but to jump into the hole and hope for the best.

Inside a strange city
  Closing your eyes, you jump down the hole.  After speeding towards the
ground at terminal velocity for several minutes, you suddenly screech to a
near halt and find yourself floating very gently and gracefully downwards. 
For some reason this reminds you of "Alice in Wonderland" when Alice jumps
down the rabbit's hole.  After almost an hour of floating like a feather,
you see sky below you.  SKY?!  You could have SWORN that you were just in a
cave.  Yet here you are, falling down towards a sky and a sparkling city
below.  The sun gleams off all the buildings, spiralling reds, blues,
purples, and colors you don't even have names for in all directions.  As you
touch ground for the first time in ages, you find yourself in the midst of
this strange underground city of sky and crystal.

Approaching Diamond Castle
  As you walk along this talcum-covered path, you see what appears to be a
large castle made entirely of glass in the distance.  Smiling to yourself,
you are almost blinded by the sunlight reflecting into your eyes.  You
shield your face with your hand, hoping that you can block out the radiance.
The light is so pure that it hurts even a powerful adventurer such as you. 
As you get a little bit closer, you see that the castle isn't made of
ordinary glass: it is pure diamond.  You whistle at the exorbitant cost, but
you realize it was worth it: the purity and beauty of the place is
unmatched.

welcome mat on the ground.  The mat is completely lavish as well, having
been woven with intertwined strands of gold and silver.  If the exterior is

You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ...

you feel like some kind of cosmic force is protecting you from harm.  Unlike

it has been corrupted.  The sensation increases as you head north, towards
the jail, but decreases as you go south towards the portal room.  The throne

  Pictures of all the kings and queens of this recently discovered kingdom
line the crystalline walls in this section of the hallway.  From the gilded
plates beneath each, you are able to trace the lineage of the monarchs from
Queen Angelina, the present ruler, back 12 generations to Queen Rosita and
King James.  What amazes you most of all about these paintings is that each
of the leaders has a genuine smile on his or her face - in many portraits
the subject smiles almost cynically, but you see none of that in the faces
of the monarchs.  On the western wall is a silver plaque listing the members
of the current royal family as well as their birthdates.  The sense of
history and pride in one's family that the royalty displays is incredible
and quite refreshing: too many people forget who they are and pay attention
instead to where they are going.  The hallway continues east and west.

  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever

  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

>>    Approaching a small mine shaft
  After having spent some time in the dirty, run down settlement of
Sargasso, you realize that the only thing the prospectors have is mining. 
They left their families and decided to dedicate themselves to one single
task.  The wind starts to pick up a little and the weird dirt-stuff flies
around for a little bit, but the gusts are not nearly as horrible as when
you were walking upon the mountain.  Still, the smell of charred flesh,
which was absent to the north, lingers on here.  What could these miners be
doing to paint such a horrid picture of the town?  You shrug off the
question, thinking it could not possibly be on purpose.  To the west you see
a beautifully colored hut and wonder why something so vibrant would be in a
place of such death and misery.

  You hear a very soft hissing noise at your feet as you begin to enter the

look at your feet and discover the hugest rattlesnake you have ever seen! 
You jump up - not out of fright, of course - and with a quick thrust, bring
your boot down upon the creature with a sickening *squish* sound.  Yuck.

  You begin to choke and gag as you walk about this part of Sargasso. 
Repugnant black smoke fills the whole entire area to your north, and you
know that if you were to go any further that your life would be in great
peril.  As the smog extends its tendrils towards you, almost grasping at your
throat, you back away nervously.  As you do so, the smoke seems to sense
that it cannot take hold of you and thus it backs off.  That was a close
call, perhaps closer than you realize.  The dirt path continues to the south
and a very large, well constructed tent is to your east.

Wandering along a dirt path
  The dirt path ends in somewhat of a cul-de-sac here, with a large tent to
the east and a very strange tent to the south.  A very soft green light
eminates from that tent, likely the result of some mystical force.  You
wonder what kind of force could create such a calm, serene aura about this
town of angst and strife.  Your body feels very light and airy as you step
closer and closer to the tent; it is almost as if your destiny is unfolding
right before your eyes.  Other than entering one of these two tents, your
only other option is to head back to the north.

  As you brush away the faded yellow tent flap, you enter a world of mystery 
that you never thought Sargasso could offer. A string of wooden beads colored
with fluorescent pinks, greens, and yellows graces the top of the tent, 
draped like holiday lights on a log cabin. Covering the fortune teller's 
circular table in the center of the abode is a sky blue handwoven cloth 
dotted with pastel purple flowers. In the middle of this piece of furniture 
is a shiny crystal ball. Its grasp on you is hypnotic, almost as if it were 
drawing you somewhere else. A gold-laced sack lies in the far corner of the 
dwelling; you presume that the seer's mystical devices reside within.
Indeed, the tent is quite awe inspiring. The dirty path lies to the north.

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

You wake and stand up.
The BulletHole Saloon (G)
  The saloon is a dark and smokey affair, with a player piano playing
wildly in one corner.  The room is lit by a single chandelier in the center,
which appears to be made from a wagon wheel.  A bar runs the length of the
south wall, and poker tables clutter the entire floor.  Nary a thing can be
heard over the din of drunken singing, laughter, and arguing.  

[ Exits: east ]
The waitress is here, serving a little more than drinks.
A grungy looking man is here.
A smelly, disheveled man is here.
A slick looking gentleman is here shuffling cards.
The gambler is here, singing a song.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by

  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Entrance to the Jewelled Palace (G)
  Small but tasteful, this courtyard is on the small side.  Surrounded by a
wall of black marble blocks, it holds a few stone benches and a withering
tree here and there.  It tends to be quiet, as few stop here for very long
on the way in or out of the Jewelled Palace.  Torches flicker in their
sconces, but never die or need refreshing, and the dim light they cast
reveals long narrow apertures in the surrounding wall.  Just the thing to
shoot arrows through at anybody foolish enough to invade the castle.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

 bigger than the bee's knees.  Back then, Mrs. James, their mama, doted on

  Heavy Corinthian columns support the auditorium building. The quiet 
atmosphere provides a relaxed feeling of peace and learning. There are 
rows of benches inside, which look very well used. The lectures and 
interviews that take place here must be drawing quite a crowd. 
The SIGN on the western wall directs your attention, where a polite
Disciple of Hassan approaches slowly and welcomes you inside.

[ Exits: east (south) up ]
     (Magic) A cuddly cow moos softly.
     A small campfire burns merrily away here.
     (Magic) (Glow) (Hum) An enormous beanbag fills the room.
Sashan is here teaching to a class of novices.
Fourak, Sashan's cousin is here, tending to those in need.

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance. 

Type 'North' to begin your journey...

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Born into Arms (G)
  
A great stone fortress towers over the rolling countryside, surrounded by what
seems to be an unscalable wall ringing its perimeter. Verdant flags flying
from the towers and draped from the ramparts declare this bastion of might to
be the Emerald Stronghold. The only entrance to this place is barred with a
weathered, yet stalwart, gate that has stood for ages.
 
On either side of the gates, mounting huge, monolithic pillars are two colossal
statues facing one another with swords crossed above the entrance. These
imposing figures engraved in marble are in the likeness of the goddess Athena
and the legendary guardian of Midgaard, Hassan. Here they stand, ever vigilant
against the darkness they united against. At the base of each pillar, a plaque
details the momentous event of their accord.

Born into Arms (G)
  
A great stone fortress towers over the rolling countryside, surrounded by what
seems to be an unscalable wall ringing its perimeter. Verdant flags flying
from the towers and draped from the ramparts declare this bastion of might to
be the Emerald Stronghold. The only entrance to this place is barred with a
weathered, yet stalwart, gate that has stood for ages.
 
On either side of the gates, mounting huge, monolithic pillars are two colossal
statues facing one another with swords crossed above the entrance. These
imposing figures engraved in marble are in the likeness of the goddess Athena
and the legendary guardian of Midgaard, Hassan. Here they stand, ever vigilant
against the darkness they united against. At the base of each pillar, a plaque
details the momentous event of their accord.

  As you enter the clinic, you first encounter the reception area. There's a 
large wooden desk in the center of the room. On top of the desk sits a few 
stacks of papers and various writing utensils. There are large double doors 
to the south and waiting areas to the north and west.

You can hear various noises on the other side of the eastern and northern 
walls, but are unable to pin exactly who or what is making those noises. The 
waiting room continues west, while the reception area lies to the south. A 
door stands to the north, leading to the main clinic hallway.

  Upon entering the basement of the clinic, you begin hearing strange noises 
almost immediately. You are unable to pinpoint exactly where the noises are 
coming from, or who is making them. They sound unnatural, and very close to 
your body; possibly in the same room. There's a ladder leading up to the main
clinic corridor, and exits to the north and south leading deeper into the 
basement.

Northeastern clinic basement
  Here is another corner of the basement. The lack of light around here makes 
it nearly impossible to see anything around the room. Occasionally, you feel 
something brush up against you, although you can't see what the being is. Is 
it possible the basement is actually haunted, or is that just your 
imagination running wild? Better find a light source and figure out what is 
going on. The clinic administration should be down here investigating.

Born into Arms (G)
  
A great stone fortress towers over the rolling countryside, surrounded by what
seems to be an unscalable wall ringing its perimeter. Verdant flags flying
from the towers and draped from the ramparts declare this bastion of might to
be the Emerald Stronghold. The only entrance to this place is barred with a
weathered, yet stalwart, gate that has stood for ages.
 
On either side of the gates, mounting huge, monolithic pillars are two colossal
statues facing one another with swords crossed above the entrance. These
imposing figures engraved in marble are in the likeness of the goddess Athena
and the legendary guardian of Midgaard, Hassan. Here they stand, ever vigilant
against the darkness they united against. At the base of each pillar, a plaque
details the momentous event of their accord.

tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood. Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks.
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see. The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air,
and gleaming eyes show from behind loose boards and piles of rubble.
Not a pleasant place to live.

  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,

  Definitely not much to look at, this one-room shack is nonetheless
typical of the dwellings squabbled over in the Warren.  With a roof so low
one has to duck to enter, and only some ragged blankets to provide comfort,
it does have one precious advantage- it's a place to hide from those that
would do its occupant harm.  And there are many, many of those.

  Oddly, perhaps, this is the most peaceful place in all of Pandemonium. 
Unlike some courts, in which nobles and citizens alike do not hesitate to
scream out their opinions and protests, King Lucifer's is maintained with
quiet decorum.  This probably has something to do with the fact that
violators of this rule are likely to find their heads on a spike.  Even
honor combat is forbidden in this grand hall built of simple stone and wood.
The King and his Princes each have a permanent throne here, around which are
usually clustered petitioners.  Lucifer's, of course, towers over the rest,
though the statues carved of stone, each depicting one of those nobles, are
more colossal than anything most demons and Damned ever hope to see.

  You are gazing over a wide expanse of grassland. There seem to be no trees 
for as far as the eye can see, and the open sky is dotted here and there with
birds. In the distance, you hear the shrill scream of an eagle, and carried 
on the softly blowing breeze, you think you catch the sounds of thudding 
hooves. It would be easy to become lost out here, but it is a nice change 
from the dusty roads, crowded cities and undergrowth choked wildernesses.

  The rolling grasslands stretch out before you.  Gentle breezes blow
through the grass, causing a small ripple over the surrounding land.  The
open sky seems full of birds racing and playing among the fluffy clouds, and
the sounds of small wildlife are everywhere.  In the distance, a herd of
animals seems to be grazing, and the scent of wild flowers and herbs is
strong on the air.

in this part of the prairie, around four feet in height.  Sounds of prairie
dogs drift to your ears, and you can just see a few of the small animals
frolicking in the tall grasses.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to watch
your footing; their holes have been known to twist many an unweary ankle.

and, in the distance, you hear the shrill scream of a hunting eagle.

Before an Old Cathedral
  After fighting your way through the trees and weeds, you finally stand
before the ancient cathedral.  A single great tower rises from the front,
where the bell of the old place must hang.  Smaller spires surround it, as
if trying to reach the sky as only the great center tower can.  Old broken
gargoyles sit on the ledges, trying in vain to keep out evil spirits. 
Directly overhead, you see where there once was a great stained glass
window.  Bats fly in and out of where the window was now.  To the north, the
doors of the cathedral still stand, more a testament to luck than their
strength.  Behind you is the path you came in on, and you wonder if using it
might not be such a bad idea.

sense of true evil emanate from the place.  Where altar boys once might have
collected the cloaks of their friends and family from the village, undead
monsters now live.  Behind you to the south is the way out, ahead to the
north is the main assemblage, and above you see the main bell tower.

Assemblage
  This is the main chamber of the cathedral.  Broken lumber now lies where
pews once were lined.  Scraps of paper are all that remain of the religious
tomes of these people.  Looking up you are amazed though, a great painting
depicts the battle of three men against a great dragon.  The painting covers
the entire ceiling, the artist making clever use of the arches and peaks in
his work.  To the west you see a small confessional chamber heavily damaged
by time, to the east you see a door, to the north is the altar, and back to
the south is the exit.

  This is a room where priests and families might have met before working
out a marriage deal.  You can see where there once used to be paintings on
the wall.  Perhaps the pile of rubble had once been a statue.  Stained glass
lies on the floor, long since knocked out of the windows.  A marble table
sits in the middle of the room, obviously built into the cathedral itself.

Front of Assemblage
  The most devout peasants would have wanted to sit up here, although probably 
the minor nobility did. Like the rest of the assemblage the pews are now 
broken and rotted. Looking up you see the painting of the battle run all the 
way to the front of the cathedral, just over the statue of their god.

Raised Altar
  You stand on top of the raised dais where once charismatic priests would
extol the virtues of their god.  Before you is a statue of their god, a
great horse-headed man holding a cow in each hand over his head.  Kinda makes
you wonder more about the horse-cow worshippers of this ancient place.
  Deciding to examine the statue closer, you see that from the neck down it
is a representation of a perfect man.  The head is posed with a rather bemused
expression.  One of the cows is actually a bull, probably some representation of
fertility, or food.
  To the east and west there are doors, and back to the south is the exit.

Storage Room
  Coming to the bottom of the stairs, you examine the room. Wine racks line the
north wall, empty and broken now. The remnants of barrels sit along the west 
and east walls. This was probably where they stored food supplies. You think 
it might be worthwhile to examine a barrel or two. You can see that anything 
valuable has long since been removed from this room. Looking around, you 
don't see any other exits. Too bad, you rather hoped to find some catacombs.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

Before an Old Cathedral
  After fighting your way through the trees and weeds, you finally stand
before the ancient cathedral.  A single great tower rises from the front,
where the bell of the old place must hang.  Smaller spires surround it, as
if trying to reach the sky as only the great center tower can.  Old broken
gargoyles sit on the ledges, trying in vain to keep out evil spirits. 
Directly overhead, you see where there once was a great stained glass
window.  Bats fly in and out of where the window was now.  To the north, the
doors of the cathedral still stand, more a testament to luck than their
strength.  Behind you is the path you came in on, and you wonder if using it
might not be such a bad idea.  

[ Exits: (north) south ]
     The broken head of a gargoyle lies here.

  A feeling of true dread comes over you upon entering this place.  While
from the outside it merely appeared abandoned and lost, from here you feel a
sense of true evil emanate from the place.  Where altar boys once might have
collected the cloaks of their friends and family from the village, undead
monsters now live.  Behind you to the south is the way out, ahead to the
north is the main assemblage, and above you see the main bell tower.

Assemblage
  This is the main chamber of the cathedral.  Broken lumber now lies where
pews once were lined.  Scraps of paper are all that remain of the religious
tomes of these people.  Looking up you are amazed though, a great painting
depicts the battle of three men against a great dragon.  The painting covers
the entire ceiling, the artist making clever use of the arches and peaks in
his work.  To the west you see a small confessional chamber heavily damaged
by time, to the east you see a door, to the north is the altar, and back to
the south is the exit.

  You stand on top of the raised dais where once charismatic priests would
extol the virtues of their god.  Before you is a statue of their god, a
great horse-headed man holding a cow in each hand over his head.  Kinda makes
you wonder more about the horse-cow worshippers of this ancient place.
  Deciding to examine the statue closer, you see that from the neck down it
is a representation of a perfect man.  The head is posed with a rather bemused
expression.  One of the cows is actually a bull, probably some representation of
fertility, or food.
  To the east and west there are doors, and back to the south is the exit.

Storage Room
  Coming to the bottom of the stairs, you examine the room. Wine racks line the
north wall, empty and broken now. The remnants of barrels sit along the west 
and east walls. This was probably where they stored food supplies. You think 
it might be worthwhile to examine a barrel or two. You can see that anything 
valuable has long since been removed from this room. Looking around, you 
don't see any other exits. Too bad, you rather hoped to find some catacombs.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Before an Old Cathedral
  After fighting your way through the trees and weeds, you finally stand
before the ancient cathedral.  A single great tower rises from the front,
where the bell of the old place must hang.  Smaller spires surround it, as
if trying to reach the sky as only the great center tower can.  Old broken
gargoyles sit on the ledges, trying in vain to keep out evil spirits. 
Directly overhead, you see where there once was a great stained glass
window.  Bats fly in and out of where the window was now.  To the north, the
doors of the cathedral still stand, more a testament to luck than their
strength.  Behind you is the path you came in on, and you wonder if using it
might not be such a bad idea.

Assemblage
  This is the main chamber of the cathedral.  Broken lumber now lies where
pews once were lined.  Scraps of paper are all that remain of the religious
tomes of these people.  Looking up you are amazed though, a great painting
depicts the battle of three men against a great dragon.  The painting covers
the entire ceiling, the artist making clever use of the arches and peaks in
his work.  To the west you see a small confessional chamber heavily damaged
by time, to the east you see a door, to the north is the altar, and back to
the south is the exit.

still travel through here as much as any other place.  You've noticed that
many of the locals appear to walk around with their head hung down, as if
they have something to fear by interacting with outsiders such as yourself.

  This corner of the courtyard appears to be funneling everyone towards the
pillar which sits just east of here.  There is a small garden planted
alongside the brick pathway.  It seems to mostly be growing potatoes and
corn.

  The walls supporting this pillar must easily be ten feet in thickness and
just about seven feet tall.  The glass used to create this towering
structure must surely be of the highest quality as you can see right through
it.  There certainly seems to be much activity going on inside.

coming from, or who is making them. They sound unnatural, and very close to 
your body; possibly in the same room. There's a ladder leading up to the main
clinic corridor, and exits to the north and south leading deeper into the 
basement.

[ Exits: north south up (down) ]
     A basement sign has been posted at the bottom of the stairwell.

  You have entered a hidden area of the clinic that sits directly below the 
basement. It appears to be some sort of lab that the clinic uses. The rickety
stairwell leading back up to the basement is very questionable and unsafe.
There are very few light sources down here, making it very dark and tough to 
see around, but you are able to see exits in all directions.

  You cringe in terror and anger at the sight of what you see in this room.
There are four cages in the room, each holding a different animal. They are 
chained inside of the cages to ensure they will never escape. You notice some
have a few abnormalities from being experimented on. It is now apparent the 
clinic uses this area to conduct experiments on animals before using them on 
patients.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"
Beatrice says, "You can say 'Cathedral', 'Castle', or 'Mine' to be sent to
 those parts of DSR."

Approaching the altar
  The cathedral continues on here, still as stunning and brilliant as it
was in the entryway.  A cyan statue of a yak stands to your west.  Yaks, of
course, are such noble and demure creatures that you can't help but wipe
away a tear - the statue is just so gorgeous.  Even though the floor is made
of the same jewel as the walls, your boots don't make any noise at all -
it's as if someone wanted to preserve the tranquility of the cathedral. 
That's completely fine with you, as you've felt more at peace here than
anywhere else.  The cathedral's altar lies to the west, the entry way is to
the east, and nuns' quarters lie to the north and south.

Inside the Aquamarine Cathedral
  You tiptoe through the door into the aquamarine cathedral and are struck
with reverence for the strange inhabitants of this bejeweled city.  The
architecture of this building is just incredible, combining the columns of
the classical style and the flamboyancy of the baroque with the twinkling
brilliance of aquamarine gems.  Diamond sculptures of exquisite craftsmanship
grace the hallway with tranquility.  The smell of fresh lilacs floats
throughout the air, sending you into a dream-like trance.  You never want to
leave this place of beauty and life, as you feel at one with yourself here. 
You notice some aquamarine doors to the south and north, while the lovely
cathedral continues to the west.

Inside a strange city (1064)

Talcum Way
  Talcum Way (which is covered with Talcum powder, believe it or not)
extends north here.  Your boots don't make the "crunch, crunch" sound that
you expect, but rather you hear a pleasant swishing sound, similar to a
broom of feathers brushing across a tile floor.  You close your eyes and let
the peaceful sounds overcome you.  You feel lighter than air, almost as if
you could float away into the clouds.  Two very decorative mansions lie to
your east and west: one made of jade, the other of opal.  To your north is a
very ancient library.  

[ Exits: (north) east south west ]
     Some iron ore from Sargasso's mine lies here on the ground.

Inside Pumice Library
  The huge stack of books continues unchecked in this part of the library. 
It appears that you can check out library materials here, if they interest
you enough.  A stack of returned books is at your right, yet to be
organized.  You chuckle to yourself as you realize how long it will take the
staff to reorganize all those books, as there must be literally over one
million books in the whole place.  To make matters even more hectic for
them, there is no real system of organization, so who knows where the books
REALLY go.  This must be a bigger pain in the butt than it is worth.

through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Through The Ice
  Somehow you've wandered onto this dangerous frozen pond.  Maybe those
punkers won't try to follow you, but how are you ever going to reach stable
land?  Maybe if you step carefully, VERY carefully, the ice won't break.  
There's no sight of the shore anywhere, looks like this ice will break any
minute. Perhaps you'd best find a way off it.

     A jagged hole is in the ice.

help alignment
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Alignment.
Help Category : Information.
Related Helps : Auras, Score, Whois, Object Flags, Mobdeaths.
Last Updated  : 2017-08-04 09:34:38.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax: align   : See your current alignment.

Your alignment is an indication of how well or badly you have morally
conducted yourself in the game. It ranges numerically, from -2500 (evil) to
2500 (good). At a very broad level, the alignment ranges are:

     875 to 2500  : Good
     874 to -874  : Neutral
    -875 to -2500 : Evil

You can see your own alignment by typing 'score', 'align', or adding it to 
your prompt.

Generally, if you kill good-aligned mobs, you will gravitate towards evil,
and vice versa.  You will get more experience for killing mobs of a
different alignment- the more extreme the difference, the better.  Neutral
players will get less experience than highly good/evil players, but the
trade-off is they have a wider selection of mobs to kill.  

Some divine spells may also cleanse you or taint you towards good or evil
with use.  Other spells may not work as well (or even not work at all)
unless you are the appropriate alignment.  This particularly holds true for
many paladin spells, since the paladin is considered a holy (or unholy)
warrior out to destroy those of the opposing alignment.

Alignment may also be used to restrict wearing certain items; for example,
an item with an anti-evil flag (see 'help object flags') may not be worn
if the player's current alignment falls in the 'evil' range of -875 or
lower.  Equipping an item and then changing to that alignment will not do
anything to the equipment, but if the item is unequipped, it will not be
able to be re-equipped until back in the appropriate alignment range.

Alignment does not play a factor in player-vs-player combat.  Protective
spells (protection good/evil affect) do not offer any reduction to damage.

Though there's no way to tell an exact alignment, you can determine whether
mobs are good, neutral, or evil through 'detect good' and 'detect evil' spells,
or by using good/evil as an argument to the mobdeaths command (see 'help
mobdeaths').

Syntax:  cast 'pray for damnation' 
Spell Number: 565

The harmer's god demands payment in blood rather than gold. If the caster
does not have enough health to sacrifice, their prayers are ignored. For a
cost of 3 hit points per alignment shift, the harmer's alignment will be
set to -2500. This means that only larger players can move from 2500 to
-2500 as it requires a 15,000 hp sacrifice.

This is a harmer subclass skill.

walls.  You take a candle from one of the holders to continue your journey. 
There's a room to your south and the corridor seems to continue.  Perhaps
they won't mind if you snoop a bit in these rooms.  Maybe one of them is the
Emperor's throne room.

  This neatly cleaned room looks like a normal room, only bigger.  The bed
in the middle of the room is HUGE!  Just like most of this castle, it is
very well furnished in gold and tapestries.  I guess the Emperor wants his
guests to feel like royalty when they come to visit.  It's not hard to in a
room like this!  Now only for some room service......

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  Definitely not much to look at, this one-room shack is nonetheless
typical of the dwellings squabbled over in the Warren.  With a roof so low
one has to duck to enter, and only some ragged blankets to provide comfort,
it does have one precious advantage- it's a place to hide from those that
would do its occupant harm.  And there are many, many of those.

  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Deception Boulevard
  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur
is never eliminated completely.

M'mog's Tavern [**> PK <**]
  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Jungle Trail
  Going down this trail seems easy.  The sun's shining down, warming up
everything and birds are chirping in the trees.  You better hope that no
dangerous creatures are out there lurking around.  With all the rustling in
the bushes, there might be a bear coming, if they have those sort of
creatures.  If talking trees are all you have to deal with, this journey

The Jungle Trail
  This trail seems to go on forever.  That tree never told you just how far
this Teutonia actually was, and what kind of town is it anyways?  You hope
the people are friendly or else you might have to make for a quick exit. 
That is if you ever get out of this jungle.  Creatures are starting to
appear more and more and they seem stranger than the tree.  Let's hope you
don't have to camp out here!

  The path suddenly opens up into a little field, and glorious mountains
lie ahead of you.  The landscape is breathtaking and you almost forget what
you're doing.  A small cave is to the west, and the beautiful music coming
out of it piques your interest.  Who lives there?  Perhaps it's a creature
that lures its prey with music?  Or perhaps not...  Maybe you should
investigate?

    ftalk                 - Communicate on 'friend talk' channel.
    friend compare <name> - Compare friend list with another friend.

The 'flist' command is a global alias for 'friend'.

Aardwolf allows you to set up a list of friends. Mutual friends will see
each other log on/off and be able to talk on the 'ftalk' channel together,
as well as a few other features.

To see your list of friends, type 'friend'. This will also show you if
they are online, offline, AFK, and/or in a note. It will also show players
who are invisible to you and it will show (Invis) next to their name, 
only if this player is also friends with you.

To add someone to your friend list, type 'friend <player name>'. The
target must be online and you must be able to see them for this to work. 
You may have a maximum of 80 characters on your friend list, or 120 if you 
have the Popularity wish (see 'help wish'.)  

Until the other player friends you back, you will see 'Not your friend.'
on the friend list. You will be notified when someone adds you to their
friend list. If this is missed, typing 'friend wannabe' will list online
players that have you friended but who are not on your friend list.  

Once you are both friends with each other, you will be able to talk to
each other on the 'ftalk' channel. This channel is seen by players which
are mutual friends; you may see conversations with a friend to another
player which is not your friend. Like other channels (see 'help channels'),
history is available; however, this history does not save while offline.

To remove a friend from your friend list, simply 'friend <player>' again.
If the player is online, they will be notified they have been removed from
your friend list. To remove all your friends, type 'friend clear'. This
will not notify friends that they have been removed. (This is useful right
before/after a rename to hide your identity.

Friend lists do not automatically update on rename.  If the friend is not
removed before rename, that person can see the renamed player on 'friend
wannabe'.  Both 'friend ago' and 'friend laston' will show Missing for a
player that no longer exists.

If you want to reject a friend request from someone who appears on your
'friend wannabe' list, or remove someone from your friend list and yourself
from theirs at the same time, use 'friend reject'. Optionally, you can
give a reason using 'friend reject [person] [reason]'. This option only
works with visible online characters.

Using 'friend compare' will only work with a person who is already your
friend. It will show friends that you have in common.

'friend' is also a valid sort option for 'who', and may be combined with
other options (e.g., 'who friend 1 15')- see 'help who'.
