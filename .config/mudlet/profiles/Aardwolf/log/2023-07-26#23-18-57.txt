Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Before A Vast Prairie
  This is a continuation of the prairie you just left.  Something is
different here though.  There is a mist that hangs over the ground obscuring
the brown, wheat-like grass.  The wind is still, yet the fog swirls as if
there is something hidden in the mist.  Off in the distance, even in this
foggy setting, dark shapes rise from the flat prairie.

  This vast prairie seems to stretch on forever.  The abundance of
wildlife here is astonishing and you can't help but notice the jagged
mountain range off in the distance.  It dominates the horizon and seems
to cast an ominous pall on this otherwise tranquil place.

as a spark to light some noxious smelling cigarette he seems to have rolled
earlier.  The room is filled with clouds of noxious smoke, and at first the
origin of this, given that you are in a dragon hatchery, is unclear, though
it certainly appears to have a source nearby.

A Dark Tunnel
  This is a huge tunnel heading down at such a steep angle that it
seems nearly vertical.  The faint whiff of sulfur catches your
attention, and it seems that the air around you is being drawn
downwards.  It may not be safe to continue further.

  Heading down that tunnel might not have been a wise decision. The tunnel is

which is barely visible running south along the edge of a massive cliff. The 
unmistakable odor of smoke and sulfur drifts southwards on a nearly

Before A Vast Prairie
  This is a continuation of the prairie you just left.  Something is
different here though.  There is a mist that hangs over the ground obscuring
the brown, wheat-like grass.  The wind is still, yet the fog swirls as if
there is something hidden in the mist.  Off in the distance, even in this
foggy setting, dark shapes rise from the flat prairie.

of the hatchlings are almost deafening. Distant corners of the cavern are 
occasionally lit by a hatchling's breath, which most closely resembles a 
matchflare in the distance at night. Some of the hatchlings tumble around at 
your feet, and an occasional overexcited one leaps into the air and attempts 
to flap its wings and fly. As yet, none of these beasts have the requisite 
wingspan, so they tumble to the floor and squeak in pain, then get up and 
dust themselves off and go back to playing.

Rocky outcrop
  As you get closer to the outcrop you see the dragon scolding any whelp
that comes close.  This dragon is preaching the virtues of schooling
and learning the ways of a dragon, before lesser races with their fears
and ineptness try to hunt and kill them.
 
This dragon, with a flick of his claw, creates the sounds and image of
a charging knight moving down the rocky pathway, causing whelps to jump 
out of the way and quickly hurry on to their respective destinations.

Pathway before the rocky outcrop
  As you proceed past the halfway point - the rocky outcrop - it's hard
to pick up the whelps' chatter as they are still talking in hushed
tones.  The shadow of the overseer is still very large and imposing.
 
More then one whelp has scars as proof of how viscious his wrath
can be under that calm exterior he puts forth.
 
The whelps are scared of suffering the wrath of the overseer by 
talking too loudly. They move along to their next class trying not to 
draw attention to themselves.

  You stumble across a room full of whelps in a feeding frenzy.  They 
don't even look up to see who has entered the room as they rip open
their next meal with their talons.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  You stand on an oversized mezzanine overlooking the church.  It's really
quite a nice sight; everything is part of the pattern, part of the whole. 
Each candle, each window, each pew helps to create a marvelous picture. 
It's surprising; from the little you know about Ivar, you wouldn't have
thought that he cared about the layout of the temple and the city to this
degree.  The mezzanine itself is carved out of black marble which is
highlighted by blood-red candles.  Vira is here, of course, as are numerous
