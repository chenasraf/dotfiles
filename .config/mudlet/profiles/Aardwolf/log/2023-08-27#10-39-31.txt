House of Cards
  You are standing in the middle of a large field. The field itself is nearly 
empty other than the colorful blue and green tent that now bars your path. A 
small sign hangs on the tent from the open flap. From inside you can hear
much laughter and talking. In fact, you're somewhat surprised that so much
noise is coming from such a small tent. Perhaps you should investigate the 
source of so much noise.

Inside a Tent (G)
  As you enter the tent, you are astonished to find yourself quite alone. The 
inside of the tent is bare with the exception of a solitary card table 
standing at the center. As you continue to wonder where all the noise is 
coming from, you notice a deck of cards lying atop the table, and next to it 
a piece of paper.

[ Exits: south ]
     A small wooden table stands here.
(Red Aura) A well used deck of cards sits here on the table.

even make out what you're standing on. You're not sure if smoking inside a 
cardboard box is wise, but then this is evidently not like the world you're 
used to. As the smoke shifts for a second you notice several giant walking 
cards.

Jokers' Room
  The Jokers' room is filled with every color you can imagine, like a rainbow
of endless colors. It is hard to concentrate with so much fighting for your
attention at the same time. Several large colorful cards wander here, their
paints clashing with the decor of the room. Resentful at being left out of
almost every card game, rarely being used, the jokers stumble around this
colorful room telling jokes to one another with their sharpened tongues.
Only a brave soul would dare to challenge them to a game, and only a fool
would pick a fight.

Trump Cards
  Taking only a few seconds for your eyes to adjust to your new surroundings,
the sudden lack of color almost makes you feel sad. But the splendor in which 
the room you have entered is kept, helps keep you feeling warm and happy. The
finest card in all the land has been used to build the walls here, and fine
furniture has been placed around the room. You wonder how so much detail has
been added in such a small card deck, then you see to whom this room belongs.
This card stands twice as tall and twice as thick as any of the other cards you
have seen.

Ace of Hearts
  A grander room you will rarely find. Filled with the darkest, deepest and 
richest shades of red, this room is a delight to behold. Precious gems adorn
each wall, making the card upon which it is attached sag and bend under the
immense weight. A giant heart shaped piece of card makes a beautiful rug
which covers the majority of this room. Truly this room has been finely
decorated to celebrate the grandeur of its owner, the ace of hearts.

  Compared to the rest of the deck this room is surprisingly barren and empty.
The card walls here are plain, colorless and with a distinct lack of anything.
Only simple unpainted cards wander here, free of suit and color.

Trump Cards
  Taking only a few seconds for your eyes to adjust to your new surroundings,
the sudden lack of color almost makes you feel sad. But the splendor in which 
the room you have entered is kept, helps keep you feeling warm and happy. The
finest card in all the land has been used to build the walls here, and fine
furniture has been placed around the room. You wonder how so much detail has
been added in such a small card deck, then you see to whom this room belongs.
This card stands twice as tall and twice as thick as any of the other cards you
have seen.

[ Exits: south west ]
(Red Aura) (Angry) This card trumps all the rest!
(Golden Aura) (White Aura) A card stating the rules, watches everything here.

Jokers' Room
  The Jokers' room is filled with every color you can imagine, like a rainbow
of endless colors. It is hard to concentrate with so much fighting for your
attention at the same time. Several large colorful cards wander here, their
paints clashing with the decor of the room. Resentful at being left out of
almost every card game, rarely being used, the jokers stumble around this
colorful room telling jokes to one another with their sharpened tongues.
Only a brave soul would dare to challenge them to a game, and only a fool
would pick a fight.

  Smoke fills the air of this small room making it hard to see the walls or 
even make out what you're standing on. You're not sure if smoking inside a 
cardboard box is wise, but then this is evidently not like the world you're 
used to. As the smoke shifts for a second you notice several giant walking 
cards.

A Game of Poker
  Here the cards spend most of their free time. And everyone knows that when
cards aren't out and about being used for card games, there is nothing they
enjoy more than a good old game of poker. Here several large cards use
themselves to place bets and gamble against themselves. They appear to be
betting using scraps of card, and you wonder which poor card was killed to
produce this game's funding.

The Bluff
  The room is silent as each card tries to stare out the other. None willing
to admit he has nothing in his hand, the bluff is played. Painted eyes meet
across the tables, faces stiff as the card they're painted on. Was that a
nervous twitch or a smile? Does he think simply smiling will mislead me?
Or perhaps he already thought I would think that......... but that means he
knew I would think that also ............... so what do I play?

The Bluff
  The room is silent as each card tries to stare out the other. None willing
to admit he has nothing in his hand, the bluff is played. Painted eyes meet
across the tables, faces stiff as the card they're painted on. Was that a
nervous twitch or a smile? Does he think simply smiling will mislead me?
Or perhaps he already thought I would think that......... but that means he
knew I would think that also ............... so what do I play?

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the

Mudpits (G)
  You stand in a training field with wet and muddy grounds.
As you continue down the fields,you realize that 
this was once a battlefield of the worthy and ruthless
but it has now been swept and turned into a training
ground.
Apart from the worn paths and unpleasant pools of mud,
this field is still be used as a training center, and
an older man in a brown uniform who is as tough as
nails.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.
     An old electric heater.
[AFK] (Player) Roume wasn't built in a day. is sleeping on Medical beds.
[AFK] (Player) Davem returning mudder from years ago is sleeping on Medical beds.

wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

House of Cards
  You are standing in the middle of a large field. The field itself is nearly 
empty other than the colorful blue and green tent that now bars your path. A 
small sign hangs on the tent from the open flap. From inside you can hear
much laughter and talking. In fact, you're somewhat surprised that so much
noise is coming from such a small tent. Perhaps you should investigate the 
source of so much noise.

  As you enter the tent, you are astonished to find yourself quite alone. The 
inside of the tent is bare with the exception of a solitary card table 
standing at the center. As you continue to wonder where all the noise is

a piece of paper.

  Although your surroundings are somewhat humble and meager there is a certain
warmth about the room you find yourself now standing in. The occasional heart
is painted on the card walls surrounding you, and several of the heart cards 
are here preparing some form of a banquet. Although they too have royalty and
classes, the great card house of hearts appears to be less strict on its
mingling between classes and other houses. Its more about playing a game of
cards then winning a game of cards if you're a heart.

  Although your surroundings are somewhat humble and meager there is a certain
warmth about the room you find yourself now standing in. The occasional heart
is painted on the card walls surrounding you, and several of the heart cards 
are here preparing some form of a banquet. Although they too have royalty and
classes, the great card house of hearts appears to be less strict on its
mingling between classes and other houses. Its more about playing a game of
cards then winning a game of cards if you're a heart.

Low Hearts
  Although your surroundings are somewhat humble and meager there is a certain
warmth about the room you find yourself now standing in. The occasional heart
is painted on the card walls surrounding you, and several of the heart cards 
are here preparing some form of a banquet. Although they too have royalty and
classes, the great card house of hearts appears to be less strict on its
mingling between classes and other houses. Its more about playing a game of
cards then winning a game of cards if you're a heart.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Castle Gates
  Above you loom the great iron gates of Castle Caraway.  Threadbare
banners still snap and wave along the side of the gates, speaking of a
happier day for this benighted realm.  Peasants trudge along this road,
scattering when they see you.  You wonder what great catastrophe could have
struck to make such a peaceful realm into a warzone.  Suddenly, you are
almost run down by a troop of horsemen who are galloping madly away from the
castle.  One of them calls to you as he passes, "Flee, neighbor, while you
can!  A dragon has kidnapped the princess and would ravage all the land!"

>>    Great Hall
  You have entered the foyer of Castle Caraway.  You stop in awe as you
gaze upon the workmanship of this famed castle.  Huge marble blocks carved
with roses form the arching, cathedral-like room. Suits of armor worn by
the heroes of days past line these walls.  Yet, within the peaceful
stillness of the castle, a low hum of dismay can be discerned.  To the north
lies the grand hallway of the castle, while to the south is the castle
entrance.  Doors to the east and west hide further mysteries.

  You stand in the grand hall of the Castle of Caraway.  All around you,
courtiers hurry here and there, talking in low whispers.  A chill air lies
upon the castle, as if some great doom had befallen the inhabitants.  A red
velvet carpet runs down the middle of the hall, leading north into the
Throne room, and south into the foyer.  East and west lie lesser hallways.

there are closed doors to the north and south.

banners still snap and wave along the side of the gates, speaking of a
happier day for this benighted realm.  Peasants trudge along this road,
scattering when they see you.  You wonder what great catastrophe could have
struck to make such a peaceful realm into a warzone.  Suddenly, you are
almost run down by a troop of horsemen who are galloping madly away from the
castle.  One of them calls to you as he passes, "Flee, neighbor, while you

despair and sorrow that seem to congeal about you almost physically as you

Castle Gates
  Above you loom the great iron gates of Castle Caraway.  Threadbare
banners still snap and wave along the side of the gates, speaking of a
happier day for this benighted realm.  Peasants trudge along this road,
scattering when they see you.  You wonder what great catastrophe could have
struck to make such a peaceful realm into a warzone.  Suddenly, you are
almost run down by a troop of horsemen who are galloping madly away from the
castle.  One of them calls to you as he passes, "Flee, neighbor, while you
can!  A dragon has kidnapped the princess and would ravage all the land!"

Before A Huge Stone
  The most notable feature of this room is the huge stone that has been
rolled across the western wall.  The sounds coming from behind that stone
lead you to believe that Gilda must be behind it, but how are you going to
move such an enormous obstacle?  

[ Exits: north east south (west) ]

  The sound of roaring escalates, and it seems to be coming from the south!
You check to be sure that your weapons are in hand and that you are fully
prepared for the coming confrontation.  You can no longer hear screaming,

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

News Stand (G)
  The south side of the reception area is lined with shelves upon
shelves of newspapers, magazines and books from floor to ceiling.  Here you
can pick up reading material on just about any subject you can imagine, and
quite a few that you can't.  Or at least, you would be able to pick them up
if it weren't for the great damned counter in the way.  Judging from the
ancient baroque cash register atop it, you're actually expected to PAY for
the privilege of reading them.  As well as periodicals, the stall seems to
have various other bits and pieces under the glass display counter, some of
which look as though they may be useful.  Other items, you suspect, are
merely random items found lying around the company offices, or scavenged
from the nearby dump, then hastily stamped with the corporate logo and a
price tag affixed.

A short man lurks behind the cash register, idly thumbing through a magazine.

Milo's Research Laboratory
  As you enter the room, the heat overwhelms you, and the clang of metal
on metal is deafening.  Finally Milo stands, and ambles over to close
the door to the forge room.  Finally, you can hear yourself think.
 
Around the room, you see freshly forged weapons and armour.  You look
around, trying to find what you seek.
 
The selection is amazing, and after staring around, in awe, you find
what it is you were looking for, and go on your merry way.

Seekers Public Library
  As you enter the room, the smell of ink from the pages tickles
your nose.  Your eyes adjust to the light in the room. Candles
are on every table, giving the room a warm and inviting glow.
Smoke rises from some of the candles to swirl and form a Sign.
 
Comfortable chairs are in the corners, just perfect for curling
up to read the vast tomes of knowledge stored within these walls.
The only sound being heard is the sound of soft whispers and pages
turning.
 
As you stroll around the store and peek at the contents of the
shelves you see such classics as Homer's the Illiad, and the Odyssey,
and the new soon-to-be-classics, from the personal library of Tefnut,
ruler of Alexandria, and cousin of Eurystheus, King of Mycenae.
 
Finally, you find the storekeeper, Imhotep, and ask him for help
finding that rare treasure you came in for.

[ Exits: north ]
Imhotep, vizier and high priest of Ptah stands here.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

The Road Not Taken
  Turning away from the busy street, you walk down a little-used alley and come
to a part of the city that doesn't seem to get a lot of traffic. You marvel at
the sights and sounds as you make your way between the houses and shops. 
Somehow, this area seems even more beautiful than the rest of Aylor. The 
buildings look old, yet you don't remember ever seeing them before. Can there
really be an entire city quarter you just never noticed before?
You make your way through a pair of city gates and out into the countryside.
Breaking away from the main road is a path following along the city wall.
Off in the distance you see a large tower made of three intertwined pillars.
It piques your attention, so you follow the path toward the tower. Eventually,
you come to a road. Though it seems neglected, there is something hauntingly
familiar about it, as if you've seen it in another world. The Granite Highway.

The Granite Highway
  Traveling along the Granite Highway, you notice a striking marble
staircase leading upwards.  Peering along the glorious blue and white 
marble, you can discern a helixed tower rising above you.  Deciding 
that the scenic route would, perhaps, be better than simply walking 
along the same, tired highway, you veer off the stone road and take 
the path towards the brilliant staircase. Wonders past the imagining 
of mortal beings must reside there, and your head fills with images 
of marble staircases, each landing revealing a new landscape or marvel.
The graceful flight of several white doves draws arcs of tranquility 
along the reddish-orange background of the majestic setting sun.  A 
northerly breeze ruffles your hair and makes the deep green grass sway 
back and forth like the gentle crests and troughs of the Dragon Sea.  
You decide to remove your boots so that your worn feet can bathe in 
the essence of placidity that surrounds you.  Thoughts of a utopian 
society enter your tired head, and you slowly drift off to sleep, 
dreaming of a land where all walk hand in hand towards a brighter future.

  This room is dominated by a long counter along one side.  The counter
is made of the same rainbowed marble found elsewhere in the tower,
and appears seamless.  Behind the counter, long rows of shelves line
the walls.  The shelves are packed with bottles, glittering with deeply
jewel-toned potions.  At one end of the counter, a small alembic lies
in a deep wall embrasure.  Written around the arched embrasure are the
processes of alchemy...Calcination, Digestion, Fermentation, Congelation, 
Fixation, Ceration, Distillation, Sublimation, Filtration, Solution,

Rowdy Ralph's Entertainment Emporium
  The cavernous interior is dark in places and bright in others.  There is 
magic here throughout, with all kinds of affects from colored bands of 
lights to sound dampening walls of silence.  In the center, a giant of a man, 
Ralph Roisterdoister, presides over beer taps.  It is rumored that under the
counter are other types of liquor...or almost anything else one might
desire.  There is a man playing a harp with accompaniment from a dark-haired
woman.  Her voice is captivating, and when she sings, people generally listen.
You head towards the back, where there are several rooms.  It seems Ralph
has branched out into several other trades, having an eatery, shops of many
and various types, gambling dens, and even though it seems out of place, a 
room of meditation.
It seems Ralph runs a clean, honest and fair establishment, and as such it
is packed with people of all sorts, eating, drinking, gambling, talking.
You feel you can do some business here as well as some pleasure.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Road Not Taken
  Turning away from the busy street, you walk down a little-used alley and come
to a part of the city that doesn't seem to get a lot of traffic. You marvel at
the sights and sounds as you make your way between the houses and shops. 
Somehow, this area seems even more beautiful than the rest of Aylor. The 
buildings look old, yet you don't remember ever seeing them before. Can there
really be an entire city quarter you just never noticed before?
You make your way through a pair of city gates and out into the countryside.
Breaking away from the main road is a path following along the city wall.
Off in the distance you see a large tower made of three intertwined pillars.
It piques your attention, so you follow the path toward the tower. Eventually,
you come to a road. Though it seems neglected, there is something hauntingly
familiar about it, as if you've seen it in another world. The Granite Highway.

The Granite Highway
  Traveling along the Granite Highway, you notice a striking marble
staircase leading upwards.  Peering along the glorious blue and white 
marble, you can discern a helixed tower rising above you.  Deciding 
that the scenic route would, perhaps, be better than simply walking 
along the same, tired highway, you veer off the stone road and take 
the path towards the brilliant staircase. Wonders past the imagining 
of mortal beings must reside there, and your head fills with images 
of marble staircases, each landing revealing a new landscape or marvel.
The graceful flight of several white doves draws arcs of tranquility 
along the reddish-orange background of the majestic setting sun.  A 
northerly breeze ruffles your hair and makes the deep green grass sway 
back and forth like the gentle crests and troughs of the Dragon Sea.  
You decide to remove your boots so that your worn feet can bathe in 
the essence of placidity that surrounds you.  Thoughts of a utopian 
society enter your tired head, and you slowly drift off to sleep, 
dreaming of a land where all walk hand in hand towards a brighter future.

and appears seamless.  Behind the counter, long rows of shelves line
the walls.  The shelves are packed with bottles, glittering with deeply
jewel-toned potions.  At one end of the counter, a small alembic lies
in a deep wall embrasure.  Written around the arched embrasure are the
processes of alchemy...Calcination, Digestion, Fermentation, Congelation, 
Fixation, Ceration, Distillation, Sublimation, Filtration, Solution,

Blacksmith's Shop
  You wander in the smithy, curious as to see the skill level of  the smith.
The smith grunts but does not pause his work, a good sign.  You wouldn't want
someone not paying attention to his work, after all.  There is a display area
with things probably for sale:  the usual weaponry, of course.  Some unique
metals are here to be seen.  One vaguely gold colored one that looks like an
unlikely amalagam of bronze and glass.  Various chains, from heavy chains
that could support a drawbridge to a silver neck-chain with links so small
you have to examine it very closely to make sure it actually is a chain.
In another section of the shop is apparently the repaired items waiting
to be retrieved.  Everything from wagon wheels to doorknobs.  Looking closely,
you can't see where the original was broken.  Indeed, this smith is skilled.
The smith turns to you inquiringly, after motioning an apprentice to
keep working the bellows.  You drag out a prized possession, a mithril-like
chain mail shirt.  It isn't exactly mithril, nor anything else any smith so
far has been able to identify.  Regardless, you show the broken clasp made
by some long ago smith.
The smith nods his acceptance and tells you that he can fix this, better
than the clasp on it now.  You agree on a price and leave, satisfied.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Entrance to the Crusader Clan Temple (G)
  It takes you only a few seconds to realise that this is no ordinary temple 
building. There is a constant flow in and out of the temple of people and 
goods. As you watch, a shipment of shining white plate armor is carted into 
the temple doors. Not long after, a group of noble knights exit the temple 
accompanied by the blare of trumpets to honor the start of a new crusade 
against evil. You notice a friendly knight standing near the large arch 
leading into the temple who appears to be directing all newcomers to various 
sections of the temple. You are convinced that your stay here will be a 
blessed one.

[ Exits: north east south west up down ]
     A small campfire burns merrily away here.
Cedric leans comfortably against a sign with directions around the temple.

The Marble Hallway (G)
  As you look around the hall, you notice the finely crafted walls of white 
marble. Within the patterns of the opaque stone you glimpse images of past 
Crusaders. They seem to be speaking words of truth and wisdom to you. As you 
near the end of the hallway you wonder what strange power dwells in this 
place. Perhaps it is simply a figment of your imagination, brought on by the 
sacred aura that fills these corridors.

The Shadowed Hall
  You have entered the Marketplace.  To your left you notice a 
room full of young knights in search of their first set of equipment.  
To your right stands a tall proud knight offering a more sophisticated list 
of armour.  Straight across the hall ahead of you is another experienced 
knight honing a set of fine weapons.  Perhaps investigating these rooms 
further will allow you to find what you are seeking.

The Temple Weaponry
  As you step into the Temple Weaponry, you take notice of the remarkable items
displayed before you. The floor is worn and scuffed by the wear of time and 
the many travellers come and gone. Weapons of the finest quality have been 
set on display, while the Weaponry's caretaker Sir William is busy sharpening
another strong blade. Each item has been designed and honed to perfection.
The Crusaders take great care to ensure the quality and holy power of each 
weapon. Sir William pauses in his work and looks over to you with a 
half-hearted smile, then beckons you to look closer at each selection.

[ Exits: south ]
Sir William looks up as you enter the room and politely offers assistance.

A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits

waits for travellers seeking her guidance.

answers "Kallendbor M'am." "Attack me Kallendbor...NOW!" Shouts Lessandra.
Kallendbor leaps into the air with a ferocious strike that would rip a man in
half but Lessandra easily sidesteps and sends him spinning with one fluid 
motion. "You see students, it's not the size of your opponent that really 
matters, but what his current position own force against him. All because I

of the veteran warriors working with the trainees, schooling them in the ways
of combat just off to the south. To the west you hear a loud noise coming 
from the nearest of the huts. You are about to go investigate when an old 
woman comes up to you and introduces herself as Miranda. "Welcome to the 
proving grounds of The Tribes, care to test yourself in the traditional ways 
of the Amazon? Let's see....what creature that has been plaguing us can I

The Training Circle (G)
  As you head on further south through the encampment you come across the 
training fields of The Tribes. You see many of the Amazon practicing 
drills with weapons, combat formations and general physical to some new 
trainees. "You, there, what is your name?" She shouts. A muscular wolfen 
answers "Kallendbor M'am." "Attack me Kallendbor...NOW!" Shouts Lessandra.
Kallendbor leaps into the air with a ferocious strike that would rip a man in
half but Lessandra easily sidesteps and sends him spinning with one fluid 
motion. "You see students, it's not the size of your opponent that really 
matters, but what his current position own force against him. All because I 
knew where to move and more importantly how to move my opponent. Now go and 
do your daily line drills." Lessandra lectures. She then turns her gaze 
towards you and asks "How may I help you?"

  As you head on further south through the encampment you come across the 
training fields of The Tribes. You see many of the Amazon practicing 
drills with weapons, combat formations and general physical to some new 
trainees. "You, there, what is your name?" She shouts. A muscular wolfen 
answers "Kallendbor M'am." "Attack me Kallendbor...NOW!" Shouts Lessandra.
Kallendbor leaps into the air with a ferocious strike that would rip a man in
half but Lessandra easily sidesteps and sends him spinning with one fluid 
motion. "You see students, it's not the size of your opponent that really 
matters, but what his current position own force against him. All because I 
knew where to move and more importantly how to move my opponent. Now go and 
do your daily line drills." Lessandra lectures. She then turns her gaze 
towards you and asks "How may I help you?"

drills with weapons, combat formations and general physical to some new 
trainees. "You, there, what is your name?" She shouts. A muscular wolfen 
answers "Kallendbor M'am." "Attack me Kallendbor...NOW!" Shouts Lessandra.
Kallendbor leaps into the air with a ferocious strike that would rip a man in
half but Lessandra easily sidesteps and sends him spinning with one fluid 
motion. "You see students, it's not the size of your opponent that really 
matters, but what his current position own force against him. All because I 
knew where to move and more importantly how to move my opponent. Now go and 
do your daily line drills." Lessandra lectures. She then turns her gaze 
towards you and asks "How may I help you?"

The Kayapos Trading Grounds
  West of the training fields you come to a large clearing that is strewn 
about with goods. Some look as though they have been plundered from other 
cultures outside of the Jungle, while some appear to be of Amazonian make.
This is where the Kayapos tribe brings goods for trade with the rest of the 
Tribes of Amazon. Shilo Enupe alKayapo seems to be the one in charge here, 
directing her subordinates to make sure all goods are traded fairly and 
quickly. Further west you see a small hut where many of the other Kayapos 
enter with members of other tribes.

Shilo the Amazon Trader is dusting off the shelves.

  After chatting with Miranda you decide to investigate
the noises that were coming from the hut to the west.  Stepping
inside you find yourself within the WitchWoman Toarasha's
medicine hut.  She has several ritual components strewn about
the hut and the smell of burning healing ointment is prevalent.
Several blankets have been laid out in a specific pattern on the
floor in order to help the wounded receive the spirits of healing

remains of the rumored Ivory City, a relic of a culture long

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Base of the Monolith
  You make your way through the small opening into a dark dank cave.  Small
lichens grow along the walls and you can hear the faint drip of water.  You
focus on the drips as your eyes adjust to the darkness.  Stalactites extend
down from the ceiling with rivulets of water coming off of them.  The drops
of water condense into pools along the bottom of the rounded walls.  In the
center of this cave a large monolith's base stands.  The monolith extends up
through the opening in the center of the cave.  A ladder seems to have been
carved into this massive monolith.

The Monolith (G)
  As you make your way along the etched ladder you find yourself in an open
expanse.  The monolith somehow supports a large circular platform made from
rock that seems equidistant in all directions.  Twelve stones, each with a
strange marking, are evenly spaced in this circle.  The marks coincide with
deep markings etched on the monolith.  Well worn paths lead from the etched
markings on the monolith and the small stones surrounding it.

A Single Stone
  Moss and lichen seem to have overtaken the platform.  A narrow path leads
to a small ruby sunk into the platform.  The stone is set precisely halfway
from the monolith and the edge of the platform.  It seems almost magical as
no lichen or moss will grow on the paths.  Small disks are littered not far
from the ruby.  The disks have strange lettering on them.  Past the edge of
of the platform you can make out a swirling vision of an arena.

into the ground here.  One is a large bloodstone and the other is a smaller
amethyst.  Both have strange symbols carved deep into their facets.  A path

leads from the stones back to the central pillar.  Two swirling visions are
adrift inline with the bloodstone and amethyst.  Over the bloodstone is one
of an under sea vision.  By the amethyst is one of the great lake in Aylor.

Pristine Beach
  You stand on the edge of a familiar beach.  A lake before you is calm and
looks almost like a sheet of mirrored glass.  You see the occasional person
sunbathing or walking along the shoreline.  A lone tree grows in the center
of an island in the lake.  You believe you have seen this place before.  It
is Pristine Lake, from the city of Aylor.  But there is something odd about
it, a strangeness that tugs at the edge of your senses as you gaze over the
water.  Another look at the city you perceive to be Aylor immediately makes
you realize what's wrong.  The buildings are hazy and indistinct.  They may
just disappear like a dream if you were to look away.  A group of buildings
to the west seems especially out of place, you are quite sure that they did
not exist in the Aylor you know.  

A lake has formed from the liquid that has spilled from the container of
water that Aquarius holds. The water looks warm enough to swim in.

The University of Aylor
  You are in a grand courtyard, filled with throngs of young people milling 
around, talking, going from one place to another. All seem comfortable, in 
spite of the racial variety. Vampires share pleasant moments with sprites, 
Trolls walk next to elves. Judging by the architecture of the buildings in 
the distance, this is Aylor, but Aylor has never seen a place of such 
peaceful coexistence. As you shift your gaze, the majestic buildings at the 
edge of your vision fade into nothingness, replaced by shoddy wooden houses.
But a second look makes them appear solid again except for the lingering 
sense of unreality.

The University of Aylor
  You are in a grand courtyard, filled with throngs of young people milling 
around, talking, going from one place to another. All seem comfortable, in 
spite of the racial variety. Vampires share pleasant moments with sprites, 
Trolls walk next to elves. Judging by the architecture of the buildings in 
the distance, this is Aylor, but Aylor has never seen a place of such 
peaceful coexistence. As you shift your gaze, the majestic buildings at the

Peak of the Monolith
  You have reached the peak of the monolith.  There does not seem to be any
air moving around this peak.  As you peer out upon the platform you see the
perfection of the circle and the placement of the markers below.  From this
vantage you can see past the platform.  Fuzzy images seem to be in line
with both the monolith etchings and the stone markers.  A peculiar smell of
brimstone and fresh rain seems to emanate from the monolith itself.

The Monolith (G)
  As you make your way along the etched ladder you find yourself in an open
expanse.  The monolith somehow supports a large circular platform made from
rock that seems equidistant in all directions.  Twelve stones, each with a
strange marking, are evenly spaced in this circle.  The marks coincide with
deep markings etched on the monolith.  Well worn paths lead from the etched
markings on the monolith and the small stones surrounding it.

  Moss and lichen seem to have overtaken the platform.  A narrow path leads
to a small ruby sunk into the platform.  The stone is set precisely halfway
from the monolith and the edge of the platform.  It seems almost magical as
no lichen or moss will grow on the paths.  Small disks are littered not far
from the ruby.  The disks have strange lettering on them.  Past the edge of
of the platform you can make out a swirling vision of an arena.

  The platform reveals the flawlessness of a circle here.  The rounded edge

amethyst.  Both have strange symbols carved deep into their facets.  A path

  Moving down into the water, the light dims slightly as you are surrounded

brush you as they swim by, startling you into backing away.  You chuckle at

  This cavern, while not completely dark, is barely lit by a faint glow from
below and to the north.  The walls here, like the other parts of the
cavern, are roughly hewn from the stone that makes up the cavern.  There
is also a strong chill and drain of energy from below.

Lichen Expanse (G)
  The moss seems to not be able to make any headway here.  Lichen has taken
over every square inch of this portion of the platform.  Oddly it all has a
silver color.  It seems to shimmer and shine under the faint light from the
stars.  A small emerald stone stands out amongst this field of silver.  The
path leading from the pillar towards the stone seems to be oddly colored as
well.  Not the same as that of the platform, but the color of moonstones, a
pale shimmering blue.  A swirling portal sits showing the murky scenes of a
small glade and calming pool.

Entrance to Cancer
  You are in the midst of a old forest with sturdy, thick-trunked trees and
little in the way of undergrowth.  A gentle wind stirs the leaves, creating
a whisper of sound that dances about your ears.  The rich smell of the loam
covering the ground surrounds you and your eyes are assaulted by the legion
of colorful flowers found tucked in crevices and on vines draped around the
trees.  Glancing about, you notice a worn path leading off further into the

  This path seems to wander aimlessly.  The forest around you seems to glow

  The forest spreads around a large open space.  The ground is covered with

whispering are stronger now.  In the center of the glade lies a small stone

A Single Stone
  Moss and lichen seem to have overtaken the platform.  A narrow path leads
to a small ruby sunk into the platform.  The stone is set precisely halfway
from the monolith and the edge of the platform.  It seems almost magical as
no lichen or moss will grow on the paths.  Small disks are littered not far
from the ruby.  The disks have strange lettering on them.  Past the edge of
of the platform you can make out a swirling vision of an arena.

Pristine Beach
  You stand on the edge of a familiar beach.  A lake before you is calm and
looks almost like a sheet of mirrored glass.  You see the occasional person
sunbathing or walking along the shoreline.  A lone tree grows in the center
of an island in the lake.  You believe you have seen this place before.  It
is Pristine Lake, from the city of Aylor.  But there is something odd about
it, a strangeness that tugs at the edge of your senses as you gaze over the
water.  Another look at the city you perceive to be Aylor immediately makes
you realize what's wrong.  The buildings are hazy and indistinct.  They may
just disappear like a dream if you were to look away.  A group of buildings
to the west seems especially out of place, you are quite sure that they did
not exist in the Aylor you know.

Lichen Expanse (G)
  The moss seems to not be able to make any headway here.  Lichen has taken
over every square inch of this portion of the platform.  Oddly it all has a
silver color.  It seems to shimmer and shine under the faint light from the
stars.  A small emerald stone stands out amongst this field of silver.  The
path leading from the pillar towards the stone seems to be oddly colored as
well.  Not the same as that of the platform, but the color of moonstones, a
pale shimmering blue.  A swirling portal sits showing the murky scenes of a
small glade and calming pool.

     (Magic) (Glow) (Hum) A polished Emerald set in the ground with an odd sign.

Where the Moss Grows (G)
  The moss has entirely overgrown the path leading to the two stones set in
the ground here.  The moss has a kaleidoscopic color to it.  Odd for normal
green moss, but it seems as though the rainbow has flooded the moss of this
area creating odd designs and beauty amongst the floor here.  A large piece
of Onyx and Jade peek out from the kaleidoscope.  Strange symbols have been
etched into them.  In the distance, far away from the edge of the platform,
two swirling visions float.  One is of a fierce competition area, the other
of a simple temple.

In the shadow of the Pillar
  This room seems quite dark, no moss or lichen grow here.  A path from the
central pillar and the odd green stone set in the ground here has been worn
into the platform.  A silence seems to be all consuming in this area.  Even
the sound of footsteps are swallowed by this silence.  The stones to either
side seem to twinkle at you.  Off past the edge of the platform you can see
a chaotic swirling mass that shows images of a courtroom.

Circling the Platform
  This portion of the platform seems to be the only spot which has any form
of noise to it.  The moss grow here in a deep maroon color, the lichen grow
crisscrossed with a vibrant shade of purple.  It almost seems like they are
trying to compete for the space of this section of the platform.  Two small
stones have been thrust into the ground.  One appears to be a richly veined
piece of turquoise, to which the lichen seem to grow from.  The other stone
is a light yellow piece of topaz.  The stones have odd carvings on them.  A
path from the pillar to these stones has been almost completely grown over.

West of the Pillar
  The platform stretches out to the edge from the central pillar.  Moss and
lichen grow here in a dark brown color.  A odd smell of wet goat comes from
this area.  It seems to emanate from the stone set into the ground with the
odd markings.  The stone appears to be a small garnet affixed firmly in the
ground.  The path from here to the central pillar seems to be slightly less
worn.  In the distance a swirling vision shows of a small valley.

Outer edge of the Platform
  The platform reveals the flawlessness of a circle here.  The rounded edge
has no marks left on it as clues to how it was made.  Two gems are set deep
into the ground here.  One is a large bloodstone and the other is a smaller
amethyst.  Both have strange symbols carved deep into their facets.  A path
leads from the stones back to the central pillar.  Two swirling visions are
adrift inline with the bloodstone and amethyst.  Over the bloodstone is one
of an under sea vision.  By the amethyst is one of the great lake in Aylor.

  Moss and lichen seem to have overtaken the platform.  A narrow path leads
to a small ruby sunk into the platform.  The stone is set precisely halfway
from the monolith and the edge of the platform.  It seems almost magical as
no lichen or moss will grow on the paths.  Small disks are littered not far
from the ruby.  The disks have strange lettering on them.  Past the edge of
of the platform you can make out a swirling vision of an arena.

Sandy Section (G)
  This part of the platform has been covered with very fine sand.  No trace
of footsteps can be seen in the fine sand.  As you move over it a crunching
sound follows you.  As you move along the sand seems to move with you which
reveals two small stones set in the platform.  One is an enormous pearl and
the other is a finely etched sapphire.  Odd symbols were carved in of these
to match all the others in the circular platform.  Out past the edge of the
platform two swirling vision sit.  One is of a great arena, the other seems
to be two twins arguing with each other.

  Sweat rains down from the faces of the bullfighter and the clowns as they
dance about, teasing and chasing the bull.  The bullfighter waves his cape,
then turns gracefully to avoid the horns of the bull.  This dance continues
until the bull, wounded and enraged, turns to charge the bullfighter.  Then
he raises his sword and thrusts it deep into the animal's neck, watching as
the enormous beast falls to his knees in death.  Cheers erupt from above in
the stands and the bullfighter turns to bow to the audience.

  A huge arch soars above you framing a tunnel fading into the gloom.  This
is the entrance to the bullfight arena and the sounds from within swell and
recede as the fight proceeds.  The air is comfortable, and the aroma coming
from the vendors' carts is enticing.  You move through an arch into a large
tunnel where it is cool and, for the moment, quiet.

  As you make your way along the etched ladder you find yourself in an open
expanse.  The monolith somehow supports a large circular platform made from
rock that seems equidistant in all directions.  Twelve stones, each with a
strange marking, are evenly spaced in this circle.  The marks coincide with
deep markings etched on the monolith.  Well worn paths lead from the etched
markings on the monolith and the small stones surrounding it.

Sandy Section (G)
  This part of the platform has been covered with very fine sand.  No trace
of footsteps can be seen in the fine sand.  As you move over it a crunching
sound follows you.  As you move along the sand seems to move with you which
reveals two small stones set in the platform.  One is an enormous pearl and
the other is a finely etched sapphire.  Odd symbols were carved in of these
to match all the others in the circular platform.  Out past the edge of the
platform two swirling vision sit.  One is of a great arena, the other seems
to be two twins arguing with each other.

  The moss seems to not be able to make any headway here.  Lichen has taken

stars.  A small emerald stone stands out amongst this field of silver.  The
path leading from the pillar towards the stone seems to be oddly colored as

The Cheap Seats (G) [**> PK <**]
  This section of seats is very neat and orderly.  Bars in this section are
on the side next to the other set of spectators and the cage hung above the
center of this section.  There is a clear view of both the judge's seat and
the jury as they hear deliberations on the matter brought before the court. 
Above the area is a cage hanging from the high ceiling by a solid chain.  A
handle on the side appears to open the cage.  You cannot make out from this
angle if a prisoner is in the cage but movements seem to confer there is.

The Bench [**> PK <**]
  Passing through the open door you find yourself in front of a large stone
structure.  Steps lead up to a large platform with a table on it.  A mallet
rests on top of the platform.  As you move around this structure you notice
the front half is a smoothed cylinder with a set of scales etched deep into
the stone.  One side of the scales holds a large stack of gold bricks.  The
other side holds a set of mangled bodies.  The scale is perfectly balanced. 
Off to the side you can see a set of thirteen chairs.  In front is a fenced
off area with a random number of chairs here and there.

Judge's Chambers
  You arrive to find yourself in a modest tight room.  Bookshelves line the
walls, each relating to separate topics of law and judicial findings of all
the lands.  A tiny desk is packed in tight near a window.  The window looks
out onto the stars and darkness surrounding them.  Near the door is a small
coat rack.  A set of robes hangs on the rack as well as a wig dyed in blue. 
A door to the south is made from heavy stone and sits slightly open looking
out onto the the judges bench beyond.  The air in the room smells stale and

The Jury Box [**> PK <**]
  This area seems very orderly.  There are seven steel chairs evenly spaced 
behind a set of wooden rails.  Behind them are six more, spaced in directly 
between the front seven.  Wooden rails are at floor level, the front row is on 
a slightly raised dais.  The back row is much higher then the first row.  As 
you make your way behind the rows of chairs, you see thick pads of paper stuck 
in both the wooden railing and the backs of the seven chairs.  All of the pads 
have a charcoal pencil placed next to them.  There is a wide space between the 
railing and the peanut gallery.

  The moss has entirely overgrown the path leading to the two stones set in

green moss, but it seems as though the rainbow has flooded the moss of this

The Cheap Seats (G) [**> PK <**]
  This section of seats is very neat and orderly.  Bars in this section are
on the side next to the other set of spectators and the cage hung above the
center of this section.  There is a clear view of both the judge's seat and
the jury as they hear deliberations on the matter brought before the court. 
Above the area is a cage hanging from the high ceiling by a solid chain.  A
handle on the side appears to open the cage.  You cannot make out from this
angle if a prisoner is in the cage but movements seem to confer there is.

  The view of the proceedings is obstructed from these seats.  Metal grates
between the spectators and the courtroom form a fence.  The grating extends
from the ceiling to the floor dividing this section of seats with the other
side.  Litter is strewn about this area.  The chairs are rather decrepit in
this part of the viewing area as well.  This area seems quite a mess.  Oddly

Peak of the Monolith
  You have reached the peak of the monolith.  There does not seem to be any
air moving around this peak.  As you peer out upon the platform you see the
perfection of the circle and the placement of the markers below.  From this
vantage you can see past the platform.  Fuzzy images seem to be in line
with both the monolith etchings and the stone markers.  A peculiar smell of
brimstone and fresh rain seems to emanate from the monolith itself.

deep markings etched on the monolith.  Well worn paths lead from the etched

Lichen Expanse (G)
  The moss seems to not be able to make any headway here.  Lichen has taken
over every square inch of this portion of the platform.  Oddly it all has a
silver color.  It seems to shimmer and shine under the faint light from the
stars.  A small emerald stone stands out amongst this field of silver.  The
path leading from the pillar towards the stone seems to be oddly colored as
well.  Not the same as that of the platform, but the color of moonstones, a
pale shimmering blue.  A swirling portal sits showing the murky scenes of a

Where the Moss Grows (G)
  The moss has entirely overgrown the path leading to the two stones set in
the ground here.  The moss has a kaleidoscopic color to it.  Odd for normal
green moss, but it seems as though the rainbow has flooded the moss of this
area creating odd designs and beauty amongst the floor here.  A large piece
of Onyx and Jade peek out from the kaleidoscope.  Strange symbols have been
etched into them.  In the distance, far away from the edge of the platform,
two swirling visions float.  One is of a fierce competition area, the other
of a simple temple.

In the shadow of the Pillar
  This room seems quite dark, no moss or lichen grow here.  A path from the
central pillar and the odd green stone set in the ground here has been worn
into the platform.  A silence seems to be all consuming in this area.  Even
the sound of footsteps are swallowed by this silence.  The stones to either
side seem to twinkle at you.  Off past the edge of the platform you can see
a chaotic swirling mass that shows images of a courtroom.

Circling the Platform
  This portion of the platform seems to be the only spot which has any form
of noise to it.  The moss grow here in a deep maroon color, the lichen grow
crisscrossed with a vibrant shade of purple.  It almost seems like they are
trying to compete for the space of this section of the platform.  Two small
stones have been thrust into the ground.  One appears to be a richly veined
piece of turquoise, to which the lichen seem to grow from.  The other stone
is a light yellow piece of topaz.  The stones have odd carvings on them.  A
path from the pillar to these stones has been almost completely grown over.

The edge of a forest
  You are standing at the edge of a dark, ancient forest.  Thick pine trees
obscure your vision and cast shadows everywhere, preventing you from seeing
much of anything more than about twenty feet away.  A blanket of calm sound
covers the entire area.  Birds are chirping and leaves rustle in the gentle
wind, almost nothing at all unusual.  The only thing strange here is that a
few of the bushes are damaged and the grass seems to be trampled in places,
like a large animal recently forced its way into the forest.

Bottom of the Hole
  After taking a wrong move you have found yourself at the bottom of a deep
hole.  Large tracks down here seem odd compared to those from above.  Large
marks mar all of the walls.  Many small bones litter the floor.  Dust seems
to kick up from the dirt lying about as you move about.  The light seems to
cloud as the dust becomes more fierce.  This area darkens the more you move
about.  As your eyes adjust to the new gloom down here you see an odd light
off to your side.  You see another opening that does not lead up toward the

crisscrossed with a vibrant shade of purple.  It almost seems like they are
trying to compete for the space of this section of the platform.  Two small
stones have been thrust into the ground.  One appears to be a richly veined
piece of turquoise, to which the lichen seem to grow from.  The other stone
is a light yellow piece of topaz.  The stones have odd carvings on them.  A

Peak of the Monolith
  You have reached the peak of the monolith.  There does not seem to be any
air moving around this peak.  As you peer out upon the platform you see the
perfection of the circle and the placement of the markers below.  From this
vantage you can see past the platform.  Fuzzy images seem to be in line
with both the monolith etchings and the stone markers.  A peculiar smell of
brimstone and fresh rain seems to emanate from the monolith itself.

The Monolith (G)
  As you make your way along the etched ladder you find yourself in an open
expanse.  The monolith somehow supports a large circular platform made from
rock that seems equidistant in all directions.  Twelve stones, each with a
strange marking, are evenly spaced in this circle.  The marks coincide with
deep markings etched on the monolith.  Well worn paths lead from the etched
markings on the monolith and the small stones surrounding it.

Circling the Platform
  This portion of the platform seems to be the only spot which has any form
of noise to it.  The moss grow here in a deep maroon color, the lichen grow
crisscrossed with a vibrant shade of purple.  It almost seems like they are
trying to compete for the space of this section of the platform.  Two small
stones have been thrust into the ground.  One appears to be a richly veined
piece of turquoise, to which the lichen seem to grow from.  The other stone
is a light yellow piece of topaz.  The stones have odd carvings on them.  A
path from the pillar to these stones has been almost completely grown over.

The edge of a forest
  You are standing at the edge of a dark, ancient forest.  Thick pine trees
obscure your vision and cast shadows everywhere, preventing you from seeing
much of anything more than about twenty feet away.  A blanket of calm sound
covers the entire area.  Birds are chirping and leaves rustle in the gentle
wind, almost nothing at all unusual.  The only thing strange here is that a
few of the bushes are damaged and the grass seems to be trampled in places,
like a large animal recently forced its way into the forest.

  After taking a wrong move you have found yourself at the bottom of a deep
hole.  Large tracks down here seem odd compared to those from above.  Large
marks mar all of the walls.  Many small bones litter the floor.  Dust seems
to kick up from the dirt lying about as you move about.  The light seems to
cloud as the dust becomes more fierce.  This area darkens the more you move
about.  As your eyes adjust to the new gloom down here you see an odd light
off to your side.  You see another opening that does not lead up toward the
surface.

  A crystal-clear brook makes its way through the tree trunks here, flowing
over grey and white pebbles licked smooth by centuries of water.  The sound
emanating from the forest is somewhat noisier here.  You catch the glimpses
of animals looking at you: squirrels, snakes, rabbits.  Obviously this is a
popular place for the area denizens to quench their thirst.  Not everything
is calm and peaceful.  A grey boulder lies beside the stream with a splotch

A Single Stone
  Moss and lichen seem to have overtaken the platform.  A narrow path leads
to a small ruby sunk into the platform.  The stone is set precisely halfway
from the monolith and the edge of the platform.  It seems almost magical as
no lichen or moss will grow on the paths.  Small disks are littered not far
from the ruby.  The disks have strange lettering on them.  Past the edge of
of the platform you can make out a swirling vision of an arena.

Outer edge of the Platform
  The platform reveals the flawlessness of a circle here.  The rounded edge
has no marks left on it as clues to how it was made.  Two gems are set deep
into the ground here.  One is a large bloodstone and the other is a smaller
amethyst.  Both have strange symbols carved deep into their facets.  A path
leads from the stones back to the central pillar.  Two swirling visions are
adrift inline with the bloodstone and amethyst.  Over the bloodstone is one
of an under sea vision.  By the amethyst is one of the great lake in Aylor.

West of the Pillar
  The platform stretches out to the edge from the central pillar.  Moss and
lichen grow here in a dark brown color.  A odd smell of wet goat comes from
this area.  It seems to emanate from the stone set into the ground with the
odd markings.  The stone appears to be a small garnet affixed firmly in the
ground.  The path from here to the central pillar seems to be slightly less
worn.  In the distance a swirling vision shows of a small valley.

Circling the Platform
  This portion of the platform seems to be the only spot which has any form
of noise to it.  The moss grow here in a deep maroon color, the lichen grow
crisscrossed with a vibrant shade of purple.  It almost seems like they are
trying to compete for the space of this section of the platform.  Two small
stones have been thrust into the ground.  One appears to be a richly veined
piece of turquoise, to which the lichen seem to grow from.  The other stone
is a light yellow piece of topaz.  The stones have odd carvings on them.  A
path from the pillar to these stones has been almost completely grown over.

In the shadow of the Pillar
  This room seems quite dark, no moss or lichen grow here.  A path from the
central pillar and the odd green stone set in the ground here has been worn
into the platform.  A silence seems to be all consuming in this area.  Even
the sound of footsteps are swallowed by this silence.  The stones to either
side seem to twinkle at you.  Off past the edge of the platform you can see
a chaotic swirling mass that shows images of a courtroom.

Where the Moss Grows (G)
  The moss has entirely overgrown the path leading to the two stones set in
the ground here.  The moss has a kaleidoscopic color to it.  Odd for normal
green moss, but it seems as though the rainbow has flooded the moss of this
area creating odd designs and beauty amongst the floor here.  A large piece
of Onyx and Jade peek out from the kaleidoscope.  Strange symbols have been
etched into them.  In the distance, far away from the edge of the platform,
two swirling visions float.  One is of a fierce competition area, the other
of a simple temple.

The Monolith (G)
  As you make your way along the etched ladder you find yourself in an open
expanse.  The monolith somehow supports a large circular platform made from
rock that seems equidistant in all directions.  Twelve stones, each with a
strange marking, are evenly spaced in this circle.  The marks coincide with
deep markings etched on the monolith.  Well worn paths lead from the etched
markings on the monolith and the small stones surrounding it.

A Single Stone
  Moss and lichen seem to have overtaken the platform.  A narrow path leads
to a small ruby sunk into the platform.  The stone is set precisely halfway
from the monolith and the edge of the platform.  It seems almost magical as
no lichen or moss will grow on the paths.  Small disks are littered not far
from the ruby.  The disks have strange lettering on them.  Past the edge of
of the platform you can make out a swirling vision of an arena.

Outer edge of the Platform
  The platform reveals the flawlessness of a circle here.  The rounded edge
has no marks left on it as clues to how it was made.  Two gems are set deep
into the ground here.  One is a large bloodstone and the other is a smaller
amethyst.  Both have strange symbols carved deep into their facets.  A path
leads from the stones back to the central pillar.  Two swirling visions are
adrift inline with the bloodstone and amethyst.  Over the bloodstone is one
of an under sea vision.  By the amethyst is one of the great lake in Aylor.

this area.  It seems to emanate from the stone set into the ground with the
odd markings.  The stone appears to be a small garnet affixed firmly in the
ground.  The path from here to the central pillar seems to be slightly less

Outer edge of the Platform
  The platform reveals the flawlessness of a circle here.  The rounded edge
has no marks left on it as clues to how it was made.  Two gems are set deep
into the ground here.  One is a large bloodstone and the other is a smaller
amethyst.  Both have strange symbols carved deep into their facets.  A path
leads from the stones back to the central pillar.  Two swirling visions are
adrift inline with the bloodstone and amethyst.  Over the bloodstone is one
of an under sea vision.  By the amethyst is one of the great lake in Aylor.

A Single Stone
  Moss and lichen seem to have overtaken the platform.  A narrow path leads
to a small ruby sunk into the platform.  The stone is set precisely halfway
from the monolith and the edge of the platform.  It seems almost magical as
no lichen or moss will grow on the paths.  Small disks are littered not far
from the ruby.  The disks have strange lettering on them.  Past the edge of

  This part of the platform has been covered with very fine sand.  No trace
of footsteps can be seen in the fine sand.  As you move over it a crunching
sound follows you.  As you move along the sand seems to move with you which
reveals two small stones set in the platform.  One is an enormous pearl and
the other is a finely etched sapphire.  Odd symbols were carved in of these
to match all the others in the circular platform.  Out past the edge of the
platform two swirling vision sit.  One is of a great arena, the other seems
to be two twins arguing with each other.

  After arriving through the large Ruby, you are standing on a wide expanse

between the top of a mountain and the depths of a steep-sided gully.  It is
moderately cool here, but the air smells strongly of sheep.  Glancing about
you see rams and goats charging along the mountainside, frequently stopping
to engage in the dramatic head-butting challenge for supremacy.

  As you make your way along the etched ladder you find yourself in an open
expanse.  The monolith somehow supports a large circular platform made from
rock that seems equidistant in all directions.  Twelve stones, each with a
strange marking, are evenly spaced in this circle.  The marks coincide with
deep markings etched on the monolith.  Well worn paths lead from the etched
markings on the monolith and the small stones surrounding it.

  This portion of the platform seems to be the only spot which has any form
of noise to it.  The moss grow here in a deep maroon color, the lichen grow
crisscrossed with a vibrant shade of purple.  It almost seems like they are
trying to compete for the space of this section of the platform.  Two small
stones have been thrust into the ground.  One appears to be a richly veined
piece of turquoise, to which the lichen seem to grow from.  The other stone
is a light yellow piece of topaz.  The stones have odd carvings on them.  A
path from the pillar to these stones has been almost completely grown over.

In the shadow of the Pillar
  This room seems quite dark, no moss or lichen grow here.  A path from the
central pillar and the odd green stone set in the ground here has been worn
into the platform.  A silence seems to be all consuming in this area.  Even
the sound of footsteps are swallowed by this silence.  The stones to either
side seem to twinkle at you.  Off past the edge of the platform you can see
a chaotic swirling mass that shows images of a courtroom.

  Waves of heat rise up from the ground.  The hot winds blow drawing up all
moisture from the air.  You find breathing difficult as the heat sears your

  After arriving at the river's edge, you realize the vessel tied up has to
be made of some sort of material that does not burn.  The temperatures have
risen even further, undoubtedly caused by the molten lava.  The river flows
and plunges away into the distance.  A ramp is set into the ground, leading
down to provide a way of board the vessel safely.  The vessel is firmly and
safely secured by its mooring.

  Around the pit of molten, bubbling lava, you find a ledge of charred rock
that remains fairly clear of danger.  The air seems extremely toxic.  It is
a wonder that you can still breathe with all the scorching heat and noxious
gases.  Looking up, you can barely see the sky.  Smoke and steam roil above
the pit to cloud your vision.

A Single Stone
  Moss and lichen seem to have overtaken the platform.  A narrow path leads
to a small ruby sunk into the platform.  The stone is set precisely halfway
from the monolith and the edge of the platform.  It seems almost magical as
no lichen or moss will grow on the paths.  Small disks are littered not far
from the ruby.  The disks have strange lettering on them.  Past the edge of
of the platform you can make out a swirling vision of an arena.

The middle of the path
  After arriving through the large Ruby, you are standing on a wide expanse
of red sand, spreading out as far as you can see.  You are on a path midway
between the top of a mountain and the depths of a steep-sided gully.  It is
moderately cool here, but the air smells strongly of sheep.  Glancing about
you see rams and goats charging along the mountainside, frequently stopping
to engage in the dramatic head-butting challenge for supremacy.

crisscrossed with a vibrant shade of purple.  It almost seems like they are
trying to compete for the space of this section of the platform.  Two small
stones have been thrust into the ground.  One appears to be a richly veined
piece of turquoise, to which the lichen seem to grow from.  The other stone
is a light yellow piece of topaz.  The stones have odd carvings on them.  A

Inside the Fiery Pit
  Around the pit of molten, bubbling lava, you find a ledge of charred rock
that remains fairly clear of danger.  The air seems extremely toxic.  It is
a wonder that you can still breathe with all the scorching heat and noxious
gases.  Looking up, you can barely see the sky.  Smoke and steam roil above
the pit to cloud your vision.  

[ Exits: up ]
     (Magic) (Glow) (Hum) A sparkling Diamond flares, nearly blinding you.
(Red Aura) (White Aura) A huge stone statue of Mars arises from the smoke.

Peak of the Monolith
  You have reached the peak of the monolith.  There does not seem to be any
air moving around this peak.  As you peer out upon the platform you see the
perfection of the circle and the placement of the markers below.  From this
vantage you can see past the platform.  Fuzzy images seem to be in line
with both the monolith etchings and the stone markers.  A peculiar smell of
brimstone and fresh rain seems to emanate from the monolith itself.

  You are carried along slowly by the flow of this muddy river.  Huge trees
grow along the banks, vines and ferns dripping from their branches. 
Colorful birds dart overhead, chasing the clouds of droning insects.  

[ Exits: north east west ]
     A rickety raft has washed up here.

       Raganatittu : Save the village in Raganatittu.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Help the village of Raganatittu.

Task 5  : Remove the danger of Nag in the village.

An ancient fakir says, "Now, you need to learn to charm snakes.  As you
 may know, they are mesmerized by melodic sounds, such as from an
 instrument like my own.  I cannot part with my flute, nor can I hunt down
 Nag myself, as I need to watch over my remaining snakes.  You must
 construct a flute of your own, learn to use it and find Nag."

along the road.  Boys chase each other while young girls watch even younger
babies or help their mothers with the daily chores.  Men hunt and tend the
fields.  Maybe a dozen huts can be seen.

The dark cave
  Entering the dark cave, an overwhelming feeling of dread and despair fills 
your being. Smells of rotten decay waft up from below with sounds that pierce
your being and make the hairs on your neck stand on end. You wonder if this 
adventure is really worth the rewards after hearing tales in the village 
about an eight-armed skeleton who stole a woman only two days ago. Maybe it 
was just the peasant's imagination working during the excitement of the 
moment. Looking around to make sure it's safe to go down, you notice 
something scrawled on the wall.

Quickly lighting a torch you hold it up, gasping with fear as you take a step
back as undead move forward. So many of them, so many different kinds, your 
mind races... How can this be that they are all working together like this?

  Standing before the door you can see faint traces of light coming from around
its edges, and you can just barely make out what sounds like a boiling noise 
coming from inside. Pushing against the door you find it locked. Taking a 
mighty swing with your axe results in a chipped blade. This door is protected
by some sort of powerful magic enchantment. You wonder what it will take to 
break this spell so you can find out what's going on inside...

A rough hewn passageway of stone
  Drawing closer, you are positive you can see a door at the end of this 
passageway now. It seems as though it only grows darker the closer you get.
Holding your hand up in front of your face, you make sure this really is 
real. As the light flickers around your skin, so warm and full of life, you 
shudder at the thought of what it must be like to die or become trapped in a 
place of such everlasting cold and darkness...

  Standing outside what appears to be doorways on either side of you, you 
struggle to see into either room, but the twisting rock curves around, 
keeping you from seeing what awaits in them. Strangely enough you think you 
see a dim glow of light coming from the west room, while the east room 
remains completely black. Looking down you notice a thin trail of blood 
running along the floor and leading into the west room...

  A ladder descends through a hole in the floor here; unfortunately it is 
covered by some type of glass dome with a strange lock on it. You nearly jump
out of your boots as a deep hiss comes from a dark corner of the room. You 
leap back and ready your weapons as a sword narrowly whistles past your gut.
Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of 
your life. Your thoughts fade as it comes at you, blades whistling through 
the air...

there is help, or at least maybe no undead to contend with. Maybe the priests
are not the only ones here trying to help.

  Strange urns line the back wall of this cavern. As you enter, they begin to 
glow and hum softly. Low moans and some wailing begin to emanate from them.
A lid pops off one of the urns and a translucent figure begins to slowly pull
itself through the opening. It is the size of a man, it even looks like a 
man, but it is transparent. With a soft glow, it hovers just above the floor.
Waiting patiently, it watches as others join it from the rest of the urns.
Once they are all out they give a nod to each other and move towards you.

  This cavern seems to be some sort of refuse dump for body parts and personal 
belongings. Apparently there must be someone else around here to use this 
cavern as a waste room; certainly the undead would not care about such 
things. As you wonder about this discovery you sense some movement coming 
from the heaps of rotting flesh and clothing. Bracing yourself, you watch 
cautiously for the source. Suddenly you are showered by clumps of rot as a 
huge bulbous creature emerges, waving two tentacled arms about. It gnashes 
its teeth in a grotesque central maw as its single eye darts back and forth 
seemingly to keep you in its field of vision.

  Running into the room, you see a band of elven warriors standing together in

It appears to be some form of bear, but it has to be undead. Its ribcage 
shows exposed bone gleaming whitely in the torch light, and numerous other 
pieces of it seem to have just fallen off. The elves are obviously 
well-trained, and they move forward in unison attacking the beast 
ferociously, hacking lumps of flesh from its body. It roars in frustration 
and, seemingly unaffected, it charges!

Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of

the north you can make out doorways leading to either side of the hallway 
while farther on you think you can barely see the outline of a door. Maybe 
there is something behind that door that can help you figure out what's going
on around here. As you ponder the thoughts you're having you hear a faint 
scratching noise coming from above you. Looking up you jump back in surprise

  These stone passageways all look the same, but wait. Is that light up ahead?
It looks like the passageway continues onward to the north and curves around 
to the west where there seems to be a faint light. There are also more 
caverns around you here as well. Maybe it would be a good idea to check these
out first.

Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of

Quickly lighting a torch you hold it up, gasping with fear as you take a step

mind races... How can this be that they are all working together like this?

out a low moan. As her last breath escapes her, the evil priest pulls her

Skeleton hisses at you!
A large, lit cavern (G)
  A ladder descends through a hole in the floor here; unfortunately it is 
covered by some type of glass dome with a strange lock on it. You nearly jump
out of your boots as a deep hiss comes from a dark corner of the room. You 
leap back and ready your weapons as a sword narrowly whistles past your gut.
Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of 
your life. Your thoughts fade as it comes at you, blades whistling through 
the air...

give off a friendly light making you feel more at ease. That is, until the 
chanting starts. Stepping up to the door, you press your ear against the cool
wood and listen intently. Several voices are coming from somewhere ahead; 
they are very faint. If this room were not so quiet, you really doubt you 
would have noticed them at all. Taking advantage of not being discovered yet,
you stop to look around. A strange symbol decorates the east wall.

don't seem to notice you walk up. You can see that their skin is gray and has

and drives his hand into the young woman's chest! The still living girl lets 
out a low moan. As her last breath escapes her, the evil priest pulls her

rage, "Kill this fool! No mortal will ever witness such a ceremony and escape

  These stone passageways all look the same, but wait. Is that light up ahead?
It looks like the passageway continues onward to the north and curves around 
to the west where there seems to be a faint light. There are also more 
caverns around you here as well. Maybe it would be a good idea to check these
out first.

you think you can make out the openings of some possible caverns on either

  A ladder descends through a hole in the floor here; unfortunately it is 
covered by some type of glass dome with a strange lock on it. You nearly jump
out of your boots as a deep hiss comes from a dark corner of the room. You 
leap back and ready your weapons as a sword narrowly whistles past your gut.
Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of 
your life. Your thoughts fade as it comes at you, blades whistling through 
the air...

  Climbing down the ladder, you are amazed to find that you are in an actual 
section that has been carved out. Torches line the smooth stone walls and 
give off a friendly light making you feel more at ease. That is, until the 
chanting starts. Stepping up to the door, you press your ear against the cool
wood and listen intently. Several voices are coming from somewhere ahead; 
they are very faint. If this room were not so quiet, you really doubt you 
would have noticed them at all. Taking advantage of not being discovered yet,
you stop to look around. A strange symbol decorates the east wall.

be in various stages of decomposition, while a few appear to have a drained

Altar of sacrifice
  Drawing closer, you see that there is no table here but in fact a bloody 
altar. Several men stand around the altar chanting over the body of a young 
woman who is chained down to it. Holding hands with their eyes closed they 
don't seem to notice you walk up. You can see that their skin is gray and has
a leathery look to it. These are not men- they are undead performing some 
dark ritual! Suddenly the chanting rises in volume until it becomes almost a 
yell. The man in the center, at the head of the altar, suddenly steps forward
and drives his hand into the young woman's chest! The still living girl lets 
out a low moan. As her last breath escapes her, the evil priest pulls her 
still-beating heart out and holds it high. Suddenly seeing you, he screams in
rage, "Kill this fool! No mortal will ever witness such a ceremony and escape
to tell about it!" The undead priests turn on you as he flees north.

you slay me. Alister will not fall before you! This heart is the key and if 
you take another step I will cast it into the portal!" Glancing past him you 
see a terrible sight. A sheet of what appears to be glass stands suspended in
mid-air with no apparent supports. It swirls with black clouds and every few 
seconds lightning streaks across the surface of it. A deep rumbling rolls 
through the room and you look back to the priest to see his evil grin of

Alister's study
  This room is lined with thousands of books and scrolls. They run the length 
of the walls, from floor to ceiling, and even that is not enough room.
Scattered piles of books are strewn about the room around a large oak desk.
Seated there sits what appears to be a man. It must be Alister. Without 
saying a word he turns to face you. He appears to be a skeleton but you sense
something is different about him. Great power emanates from his being and his
eyes remain intact in his skeletal form. He rises to stand before you.

Alister exclaims, "I knew someone would come, but not to worry.  You

 be born again. Resurrected by the great God of all things terrible,
 Nerull, my lord and savior, is on his way!  NOW TASTE MY POWER!!"

Alister's study
  This room is lined with thousands of books and scrolls. They run the length 
of the walls, from floor to ceiling, and even that is not enough room.
Scattered piles of books are strewn about the room around a large oak desk.
Seated there sits what appears to be a man. It must be Alister. Without 
saying a word he turns to face you. He appears to be a skeleton but you sense
something is different about him. Great power emanates from his being and his
eyes remain intact in his skeletal form. He rises to stand before you.

  At last the high priest stands before you. Holding the still-beating heart 
defiantly in one hand he beckons you forward. "You cannot stop us, even if 
you slay me. Alister will not fall before you! This heart is the key and if 
you take another step I will cast it into the portal!" Glancing past him you 
see a terrible sight. A sheet of what appears to be glass stands suspended in
mid-air with no apparent supports. It swirls with black clouds and every few 
seconds lightning streaks across the surface of it. A deep rumbling rolls 
through the room and you look back to the priest to see his evil grin of 
triumph. He laughs insanely, confident you are lost.

The glass portal
  At last the high priest stands before you. Holding the still-beating heart 
defiantly in one hand he beckons you forward. "You cannot stop us, even if 
you slay me. Alister will not fall before you! This heart is the key and if 
you take another step I will cast it into the portal!" Glancing past him you 
see a terrible sight. A sheet of what appears to be glass stands suspended in
mid-air with no apparent supports. It swirls with black clouds and every few 
seconds lightning streaks across the surface of it. A deep rumbling rolls 
through the room and you look back to the priest to see his evil grin of 
triumph. He laughs insanely, confident you are lost.

[ Exits: north (south) ]
     (Magic) (Glow) (Hum) A flat plane of glass stands upright here, a storm swirling in the middle
of it.

Chamber of the cauldron
  Finally entering this room, you realize your efforts were not enough to stop 
the evil from being released. A huge black cauldron rests over a magical blue
fire in the center of a pentagram. Foul sulfurous fumes rise up from the 
boiling green liquid, and a shape begins to take form. The green goo begins 
to rock from side to side; growing in its actions, it starts to actually rise
up from out of the cauldron. Seeming as though it is trying to pull itself 
from within the container, it reaches higher and higher towards the ceiling 
until suddenly it stops. The liquid suspended in a column continues to flow 
up and down in a swirling pattern and features begin to form. In horror you 
watch as a skeleton ten feet tall steps from within the goo. Reaching back 
into the cauldron it pulls a robe as dark as the darkest night from within 
and dons it. Again reaching into the infernal mix it pulls out a huge scythe.
Turning to face you, the being speaks, "I am Nerull the god of all evils.
Death, pestilence, famine, suffering, and decay are my tools of pleasure, and
the ever living undead are my children. Have you come to serve me or fall 
beneath the path of my destruction?"

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Before the Crypt of Souls (G)
  You have reached the back of the graveyard and find a stone crypt. The thick 
stone doors do not appear to have been opened in some time, and all seems to 
go quiet as you examine the entrance more closely. You can not shake the 
feeling that something is watching you. The graveyard is back to the north, 
and the unknown lies through the doors.

Before an old stone wall
  Behind the crypt of the graveyard stands a short stone wall that blocks
you from an old, village that must have been destroyed long ago.  You feel
somewhat uneasy, although nothing that you can see suggests danger. 
Peaceful animals and insects are wandering around, light wind shuffles the
grass, but you can feel the area is saturated with something ancient...  And
evil.

An overgrown stone path
  Trying to cast away your bad feelings, you step into the village,
following an overgrown path.  The path is made of stone slabs which look
unusually new.  To the south the wall of the graveyard grows taller blocking
your pass.  The stone path continues to the north, where you can see the
remnants of houses that were previously dwelled in by the villagers.  One of

  Unlike the slabs that you have seen on the main path, the ones that you are 
walking on right now are really jagged, and it takes some effort not to break
your feet walking on this path. You are so busy with this that you almost 
bump yourself into the wall of the building which stands now to your north.
It is considerably bigger than the other houses, and you conclude that it 
must have been the village store.

A turn in the path
  The path makes a sharp turn to the west.  It seems that once it continued
north, but the way is now blocked by ruins of old houses.  You notice that
the deeper into the village you proceed, the more severe results of
destruction you meet.  The path ahead leads to what looks like the village
graveyard.  

[ Exits: south west ]
A snail crawls slowly along the path, looking for fresh grass.
(Red Aura) A tiny rat sniffs the air here.

  You have arrived at an old graveyard, the long untouched soil suggesting
a lack of recent funerals.  Heavy grave stones, covered with patches of
black, sun-burnt grass, somehow remind you of doors, with keyholes
displaying keys stuck in from the inner sides.  A light wind brings a breath
of fresh forest air from the north, and with it a quiet moan...  As you
stand, deciding whether to proceed any further, the ground at your feet
shakes, and the sound of a turning key chills you to the bone.

A dark hallway in the Necromancers' Guild
  Following the corridor in the guild, you stumble upon an interesting
view: poor zombies, most of them without at least some body parts are
wandering, crawling, sitting around the room.  Taking a closer look, you
realize that they were not damaged by some mighty necromancer, but were just
created to be so.  You realize that they must be the fruits of the students'
experiments.  Classrooms should be nearby.

  You continue your journey along the halls of the necromancer's guild by
taking the dark hallway leading north.  Suddenly, a cat's scream and a
chicken's yelp coming from the west break the silence.  You stop
immediately, astonished.  Animals, underground?  In the next second another
scream, which did sound like it was produced by a wailing ghost, comes from
the east.  You wonder what is going on around here.

  Upon entering the room, you feel that the necromancer that lives here is
pretty distracted and untidy.  Spellbooks are lying around the room, elixers
and staves are all over the bed and the shelves.  In fact, the wizard is so
distracted, that he doesn't even notice your intervention.

  Judging by the appearance of the room, its inhabitant is an old and

at the desk, you can see ancient books and tomes speaking about the aspects
of advanced necromancy.  Touching one of them, you immediately feel a rush
of evil force going through your whole body.  If only touching them produces
such an effect, what could happen if you read out a few spells from them?!

A small dark portal room
  You are standing in a small, very dark and obscure room.  The first thing
you notice are the huge statues that stand around the room, supporting the
ceiling.  You really don't like the look on their faces.  Behind the statues
you can see guardians playing with their swords, and pointing in your
direction.  Suddenly, you feel something very cold behind yourself, and turn
around to find a portal shimmering next to the wall.

  Following the corridor in the guild, you stumble upon an interesting
view: poor zombies, most of them without at least some body parts are
wandering, crawling, sitting around the room.  Taking a closer look, you
realize that they were not damaged by some mighty necromancer, but were just
created to be so.  You realize that they must be the fruits of the students'
experiments.  Classrooms should be nearby.

  You have arrived at an old graveyard, the long untouched soil suggesting
a lack of recent funerals.  Heavy grave stones, covered with patches of
black, sun-burnt grass, somehow remind you of doors, with keyholes
displaying keys stuck in from the inner sides.  A light wind brings a breath
of fresh forest air from the north, and with it a quiet moan...  As you
stand, deciding whether to proceed any further, the ground at your feet
shakes, and the sound of a turning key chills you to the bone.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Syntax: cast 'solidify' <item>

High level mages and psionicists are able to manipulate the molecular
structure of items they are carrying to make them more compact. The result
of this spell is that items previously invisible can now be seen by the
average eye.

An extremely lucky caster has a small chance of adding hitroll or damroll
to the item they solidify.  Once this happens, the solidified flag is added
to the item and it is not possible to cast solidify upon it again.  Items
must be wearable in a specific position (e.g., 'take hold', 'take waist')
in order to receive stats from this spell.  Items with only 'Wearable:
take' will not receive stats from this spell.

Primary stat: Intelligence, Wisdom.
Affected by : Luck.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  Waves gently lap at the glimmering sands here, creating a calming rhythmic

seamen tirelessly unloading supplies. Inland a short distance, you spot a 
makeshift camp positioned just before a towering forest. A dim rainbow arcs 
up in front of the camp like an entryway.

A sprawling beach
  The beach seems to stretch to the horizon to either side of you, yet has an 
unnerving feel of going nowhere. The sun's rays warm the opalescent sands 
beneath your feet. As the light plays with the tiny grains, they reflect 
marvelous colors back into the air. The campsite up ahead stands in stark 
contrast to the radiance of the sands. As rays of light dance off the sands, 
they cast an iridescent wreath around the camp.

Outside of Svrogan's camp
  Stepping out of the logging camp, a calming silence falls over you. There is 
a sense of serenity about the hills, and as far as the eye can see lies a 
dense forest. As the sunlight peeks through the heavy canopy above, you see 
an occasional glimmer of axe and sawblade.

Into the forest
  As you move further into the forest, an eerie silence fills the air. While 
the chirp of birds and chatter of critters permeated the edge of the forest, 
they remain only faint memories in your ears here. The rhythmic swings of a 
lumberjack's axe are met with the ringing of iron as though it was a 
blacksmith's hammer on an anvil.

Into the forest
  As you move further into the forest, an eerie silence fills the air. While 
the chirp of birds and chatter of critters permeated the edge of the forest, 
they remain only faint memories in your ears here. The rhythmic swings of a 
lumberjack's axe are met with the ringing of iron as though it was a 
blacksmith's hammer on an anvil.

       Logging : Set up camp in the Ironwoods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Breaking new ground

Svrogan has asked for your help in establishing his logging camp. Proceed 
with care though, as these are uncharted woods.

Task 4  : Build the logging camp cabins
          stacks of lumber milled:  0

Svrogan has asked you to harvest lumber to build the cabins. He gave you an
axe to help you cut useable lumber from the nearby trees. If you lose it,
you should ask Svrogan for a new axe.
He sent you out to gather 20 logs.

  Deeper into the ironwood forest, the pinging and chopping of axes are but a

Edge of an ancient forest
  Standing at the edge of the forest, trees tower over you. As bark twists and 
covers massive trunks, it creates fissures that reveal a heart of iron within
the wood. An occasional woodland critter scurries indifferently up the 
iron-wood behemoths, stopping to stare back at you only momentarily.

Deep in the ironwoods
  Deeper into the ironwood forest, the pinging and chopping of axes are but a 
memory ringing through your head. The moaning of the trees has intensified to
take the place of the silence. All around you the mighty trees seem to close 
in on your path, and despite the lack of wind you are certain you see the 
rustling of leaves. In the corner of your eye, a tree stretches luxuriously, 
as if waking from a long slumber.

  Barely audible, the ringing of axes upon the ironwood trees is but a 
distraction here. The air is still in this dense thicket, and yet there 
remains an eerie howl amidst the trees. Before you, the trees become too 
dense to pass. In either direction you see a narrow path onward, through the 
ironwood.

  The ironwood trees crowd the path here, and the ringing of distant axeblades 
seems to reverberate all around you. In all directions the mighty metallic 
trunks offer no clue as to which way to continue. Pressing forward may take 
you deeper into the forest, although you cannot be certain you haven't 
doubled back on your starting position.

with care though, as these are uncharted woods.

Task 4  : Build the logging camp cabins

Svrogan has asked you to harvest lumber to build the cabins. He gave you an
axe to help you cut useable lumber from the nearby trees. If you lose it,
you should ask Svrogan for a new axe.
He sent you out to gather 20 logs.

seems to reverberate all around you. In all directions the mighty metallic 
trunks offer no clue as to which way to continue. Pressing forward may take 
you deeper into the forest, although you cannot be certain you haven't 
doubled back on your starting position.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Waves gently lap at the glimmering sands here, creating a calming rhythmic

makeshift camp positioned just before a towering forest. A dim rainbow arcs 
up in front of the camp like an entryway.

  The beach seems to stretch to the horizon to either side of you, yet has an 
unnerving feel of going nowhere. The sun's rays warm the opalescent sands 
beneath your feet. As the light plays with the tiny grains, they reflect 
marvelous colors back into the air. The campsite up ahead stands in stark 
contrast to the radiance of the sands. As rays of light dance off the sands, 
they cast an iridescent wreath around the camp.

  Sawdust fills the air, creating a thick dust that blankets everything in

Deep in the ironwoods
  Deeper into the ironwood forest, the pinging and chopping of axes are but a 
memory ringing through your head. The moaning of the trees has intensified to
take the place of the silence. All around you the mighty trees seem to close 
in on your path, and despite the lack of wind you are certain you see the 
rustling of leaves. In the corner of your eye, a tree stretches luxuriously, 
as if waking from a long slumber.

with care though, as these are uncharted woods.

          stacks of lumber milled:  0

Svrogan has asked you to harvest lumber to build the cabins. He gave you an
axe to help you cut useable lumber from the nearby trees. If you lose it,
you should ask Svrogan for a new axe.
He sent you out to gather 20 logs.

       Logging : Set up camp in the Ironwoods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Breaking new ground

Svrogan has asked for your help in establishing his logging camp. Proceed 
with care though, as these are uncharted woods.

Task 4  : Build the logging camp cabins
          stacks of lumber milled:  0

Svrogan has asked you to harvest lumber to build the cabins. He gave you an
axe to help you cut useable lumber from the nearby trees. If you lose it,
you should ask Svrogan for a new axe.
He sent you out to gather 20 logs.

You should find a way to refine the raw lumber. Perhaps Svrogan's lumber
mill would do the trick?

Svrogren's saw mill
  A flat clearing lies before you. In the middle of it stands a massive saw 
mill, spewing sawdust as it tirelessly spins through massive trees. This must
be the heart of the logging operation, and as soon as lumberjacks return to 
camp with a harvest, they drop it with the burly operator here before heading
back out to the woods. He mills log after log, turning even the most massive 
of trees into manageable planks of useable lumber.

[ Exits: east ]
     (Magic) (Glow) (Hum) Sparks fly from the mill as whirling blades saw through ironwood lumber.
This stout lumberjack is here to help you operate the saw mill safely.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground before you without a hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind 
after all.

At an impasse
  The ironwood trees here have grown too thick to proceed. The trunks have 
grown so near each other as to create a formidable wall. The ring of an axe 
is but a distance sound in this corner of the forest. In its absence the 
eerie groan of the trees intensifies. It is almost as if they are speaking, 
or plotting amongst themselves.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

  The ironwood trees crowd the path here, and the ringing of distant axeblades 
seems to reverberate all around you. In all directions the mighty metallic 
trunks offer no clue as to which way to continue. Pressing forward may take 
you deeper into the forest, although you cannot be certain you haven't 
doubled back on your starting position.

take the place of the silence. All around you the mighty trees seem to close

they remain only faint memories in your ears here. The rhythmic swings of a

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind 
after all.

Intersection in the forest
  Barely audible, the ringing of axes upon the ironwood trees is but a 
distraction here. The air is still in this dense thicket, and yet there 
remains an eerie howl amidst the trees. Before you, the trees become too 
dense to pass. In either direction you see a narrow path onward, through the 
ironwood.

Lost in the ironwood forest
  The ironwood trees crowd the path here, and the ringing of distant axeblades 
seems to reverberate all around you. In all directions the mighty metallic 
trunks offer no clue as to which way to continue. Pressing forward may take 
you deeper into the forest, although you cannot be certain you haven't 
doubled back on your starting position.

Intersection in the forest
  Barely audible, the ringing of axes upon the ironwood trees is but a 
distraction here. The air is still in this dense thicket, and yet there 
remains an eerie howl amidst the trees. Before you, the trees become too 
dense to pass. In either direction you see a narrow path onward, through the 
ironwood.

Meandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind 
after all.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

[ Exits: north east ]
(Golden Aura) A stout ironwood bars your way with a shimmering wooden shield.
(Golden Aura) The branches of this Ironwood snap shut violently as you get near.
(Golden Aura) An Ironwood psithurist plays a faint but dulcet tune on its leaves.

Lost in the ironwoods

seems to reverberate all around you. In all directions the mighty metallic 
trunks offer no clue as to which way to continue. Pressing forward may take 
you deeper into the forest, although you cannot be certain you haven't 
doubled back on your starting position.

Meandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf
floats to the ground slowly before you without hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind 
after all.

Wandering through the ironwoods
  Walking through the ironwoods, the clanging sounds of axes upon the hardwood 
fade into the background. In their place, wind whispers through the trees and
deep, creaking groans rise up as if the woods are talking. Trees that appear 
much too massive to be doing so, sway in the wind all around you. A leaf 
floats to the ground before you without a hint of being carried by the 
lightest breeze, suggesting the noise all around might not be the wind after 
all.

  A flat clearing lies before you. In the middle of it stands a massive saw 
mill, spewing sawdust as it tirelessly spins through massive trees. This must
be the heart of the logging operation, and as soon as lumberjacks return to 
camp with a harvest, they drop it with the burly operator here before heading
back out to the woods. He mills log after log, turning even the most massive 
of trees into manageable planks of useable lumber.

 tales. We figured they were jist that, a wee story for the wee children.
 Somethin' to teach them to respect nature and learn to use what they
 harvested."

Svrogan exclaims, "They were... just stories!"

Svrogan asks, "Ever since we started harvesting lumber in these woods..
 well the woods have been growing restless. Surely you can hear it in the
 wind?"
Svrogan says, "I need to git me armory up and running as soon as possible,
 so as to replace the axes and other defenses that didn't make the

Svrogan stands up, looking at you with resolution and the bravery of a man about to send you out to
do his dirty work.
Svrogan says, "You be needin' to venture back into the wood. Don' worry,
 they don't seem to be hostile towards us, least not yet. I need you to

distraction here. The air is still in this dense thicket, and yet there 
remains an eerie howl amidst the trees. Before you, the trees become too 
dense to pass. In either direction you see a narrow path onward, through the 
ironwood.

the chirp of birds and chatter of critters permeated the edge of the forest, 
they remain only faint memories in your ears here. The rhythmic swings of a

Russell says, "Have you met my brother? Not these saplings along the paths
 you travel..."
Russell says, "We have stood here for centuries, shrouded from the outside
 world who sought to drive us from our land."

Russell says, "I am confused by you and your hairy-faced friends. On the
 one hand, you rustle with feeling. On the other, you make our sapplings
 into sticks, and make boxes from these. I watch as you go inside these
 boxes at night, as if afraid of the moon."
Russell says, "What is it you do in there? Wait, don't say. My eldest
 brother Arvid wishes to hear it from you as well."

Russell says, "I will take you to him. But first I need you to help me
 find the way. The way can only be found by a friend of the forest. But
 this friend must be free to find that which is lost. One who is certain of
 the way forward is certain to become lost, and one who is lost is ready to
 find that which does not want to be found."

 me a friend to lead us to the forgotten groves."

       Logging : Set up camp in the Ironwoods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Breaking new ground

Svrogan has asked for your help in establishing his logging camp. Proceed 
with care though, as these are uncharted woods.

Task 6  : Help Svrogan set up the armory

Svrogran warns you of a new danger from the ironwoods. It seems they
are not happy with being harvested for wood. 
He has asked you to discover the location of an ancient Ironwood tree and
retrieve the heart of iron that lies within it. While the path to the 
ancient tree lies hidden within the dense forest, Svrogan suggests you 
greet the friendly Ironwood at the edge of the forest with a rustle. 

Task 7  : Find the ancient hidden grove

Russell has offered to take you to meet his brother Arvid, who is the oldest 
of the Ironwood trees here. Russell cannot find his way back to the ancient 
and hidden grove of trees without some help. He has told you to find a friend
of the forest who is able to find the path.

Russell gave you a riddle: 
"The way can only be found by a friend of the forest. But this friend must be
 free to find that which is lost. One who is certain of the way forward is
 certain to become lost, and one who is lost is ready to find that which does
 not want to be found."

An intersection in the ironwoods
  Barely audible, the ringing of axes upon the ironwood trees is but a 
distraction here. The air is still in this dense thicket, and yet there 
remains an eerie howl amidst the trees. Before you, the trees become too 
dense to pass. In either direction you see a narrow path onward, through the 
ironwood.

       Logging : Set up camp in the Ironwoods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Breaking new ground

Svrogan has asked for your help in establishing his logging camp. Proceed 
with care though, as these are uncharted woods.

Task 6  : Help Svrogan set up the armory

Svrogran warns you of a new danger from the ironwoods. It seems they
are not happy with being harvested for wood. 
He has asked you to discover the location of an ancient Ironwood tree and
retrieve the heart of iron that lies within it. While the path to the 
ancient tree lies hidden within the dense forest, Svrogan suggests you 
greet the friendly Ironwood at the edge of the forest with a rustle. 

Task 7  : Find the ancient hidden grove

Russell has offered to take you to meet his brother Arvid, who is the oldest 
of the Ironwood trees here. Russell cannot find his way back to the ancient 
and hidden grove of trees without some help. He has told you to find a friend
of the forest who is able to find the path.

Russell gave you a riddle: 
"The way can only be found by a friend of the forest. But this friend must be
 free to find that which is lost. One who is certain of the way forward is
 certain to become lost, and one who is lost is ready to find that which does
 not want to be found."

You notice that when an Ironwood tree is killed, there are many forest 
friends to loot.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Breaking new ground

Svrogan has asked for your help in establishing his logging camp. Proceed 
with care though, as these are uncharted woods.

Task 6  : Help Svrogan set up the armory

Svrogran warns you of a new danger from the ironwoods. It seems they
are not happy with being harvested for wood. 
He has asked you to discover the location of an ancient Ironwood tree and
retrieve the heart of iron that lies within it. While the path to the 
ancient tree lies hidden within the dense forest, Svrogan suggests you 
greet the friendly Ironwood at the edge of the forest with a rustle. 

Task 8  : Bring back the Heart of Iron

After finding your way to the hidden grove, all that remains is to find a way
to bring the heart of iron back to Svrogan.

Svrogan says, "Legend has it that any metal hammered out on an anvil made
 of this heart be sharp e'nuff to cut through the roots of this earth.
 We'll have no problem fending off the ironwood if they come for us in our
 camp now."

Svrogan says, "Yev truly dun it! Not only 'ave yer helped build our
 foothold on the Ironwood Isles again, ye'v seen to it that we'll be able
 to stay. I cannot possibly repay you."

Your skin feels soft again.

Svrogan leans into his cabin and grabs a heavy metal box.

Svrogan exclaims, "I can try though. Take this. It'll light yer way
 through the darkest of times and keep you from being caught off guard in
 these here woods. Might be you find use of it along your travels
 elsewhere, too!"

                     Goal information for: Intrigues of Times Past 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Family Balmtor, once a strong and noble family, lost their status and power
due to an argument, many years ago. With the "sudden" death of the late
king Victor, fingers are being pointed everywhere and at everyone. And
while there are those who seem pleased with the new management, some stand
to lose their lives because of it. Can you solve the murder of the late
king and reinstate family Balmtor as nobility?

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

Ruo flies in from the east.

Ruo informs a Grumpy Old General that he has completed his quest.

Ruo scans all directions, looking for signs of life.

Ruo disappears!

Your force shield shimmers then fades away.

You can no longer avoid some attacks.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

In The Teeth Of The Gale (G)
  You stare down the teeth of a furious gale, awestruck by the fury
of nature's wrath.  The wind rips through the riggings over your
head, and the main mast creaks alarmingly as the wind steps up
its efforts with a mighty wail.
 
The ship suddenly tilts in an alarming fashion, sending anything
not tied down slamming across the deck and into the ocean.  A
furious clanging indicates the captain is summoning the crew.

[ Exits: east down ]
( 3) A map of the Cape beckons luringly.
Captain Vanderdecker stares into the storm thoughtfully.
The devil waves a contract around temptingly.

On the Flying Dutchman (G)
  You stand in the eye of the storm, the ship calmed as a furious gale
rages all about it.  Waves twice the size of the ship swirl all around you,
but within the circle of peace, the water is as still as a lady's bathtub. 
A cool breeze passing through makes the sails shudder slightly, and the crew
looks nervously around, tightening their grips on the railing.  

[ Exits: east west ]
The devil grins as he tempts another soul to hell.
Captain Vanderdecker signs his soul away with a sigh.

Westport Town
  You stand in the center of a bustling town, people all around you
conducting their business and talking with friends.  A crisp breeze brings
you the salty tang of the sea, and the crying of sea birds fills the air.

On the Deck of the Flying Dutchman
  You stand once more on the deck of the Flying Dutchman, as it departs
from town.  The day is cool and clear, and the sun slowly rises in the east,
beckoning you onwards.  On a day like this, it is impossible to believe in
evil...  A seagull settles on the railing next to you and peers at you
inquisitively, as if to ask if you are giving handouts, and then cries a
long wail and flaps off across the ocean again.  A light breeze springs up,
carrying to you the sounds of singing as the sailors go about their
business.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  As you approach the gates of the Castle, two guards greet you, saying;
"Welcome to Northstar Castle.  May your visit be good".  They move aside to
let you pass.  The sight of the castle fills your eyes with awe for the
people that live in there.  The smooth limestone blocks seem to glimmer as
the sunlight bounces off them.

and see many workers cleaning a large stain glass window above the queen. 
To the east and west you see hallways leading to other places in the castle.
Perhaps one of them will go to Elena's room.  Standing next to the queen is

"Welcome to Northstar Castle.  May your visit be good".  They move aside to
let you pass.  The sight of the castle fills your eyes with awe for the
people that live in there.  The smooth limestone blocks seem to glimmer as
the sunlight bounces off them.

and see many workers cleaning a large stain glass window above the queen. 
To the east and west you see hallways leading to other places in the castle.
Perhaps one of them will go to Elena's room.  Standing next to the queen is
Devlin, the queen's bodyguard.  He has sworn to protect her and her family
to the death.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva

The centre of the maze (G)
  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

A large pile of comfortable looking autumn leaves have been raked together to

Birds and butterflies
  The leafy hedges, tall and green, line the path through the garden. Pure 
white butterflies flitter around, dancing with each other as they fly through
the air, their wings glimmering in the light. Birds twitter merrily as they 
swoop and dart about, very comfortable with the level of safety from 
predators. The garden is a safe haven for the smaller creatures as there 
really is no way in nor out, that you can see.

A path through the hedges
  The hedges are a little unkempt and could used a slight pruning. The extended
growth is a lighter green to the main plant and they wave around in the 
breeze as it passes by. Bright yellow daisies, with black centres, are 
beginning to open up their petals as they wake up in their home among the 
grass. A couple of bees are busily collecting the virgin pollen from this new
growth of life.

  A small creek crosses the path through the hedges and a low wooden planked 
bridge crosses it. To either side of the bridge you can see the water flowing

short grass is soft and spongy, which springs back into place, leaving no

  Tall and dark leafy hedges guide your path through the garden maze, shutting 
out all visions of the world outside. The sounds from the world beyond the

leaves, attracted by something you cannot see nor smell, completely unmindful

  The path ends when the tall, leafy hedges block the way forward. A 
beautifully carved marble fountain, with sculptures of dolphins and mermaids,
frozen forever in various poses, bubbles merrily. The water in the fountain 
is a kaleidoscope of colours, slowly changing hues as the water flows forth 
from the spouts in the marble figures. Wrought iron seats ring the fountain, 
placed at widely spaced intervals, and garden beds of colourful petunias 
grace the empty spaces in between.

Tall, dark and leafy
  Tall and dark leafy hedges guide your path through the garden maze, shutting 
out all visions of the world outside. The sounds from the world beyond the 
hedges cannot penetrate the barrier either, like it is magically protecting 
all within from outside interference. Some small dragonflies hover around the
leaves, attracted by something you cannot see nor smell, completely unmindful
of your presence.

Intersecting birdseed
  An intersection of pathways in the garden is adorned by the presence of a 
birdbath. A beautifully hand carved masterpiece, with multiple tiers of 
shallow dishes, is filled with fresh water and the top tier is filled with 
bird seed. Small birds frequently visit, to splash around in the water in 
play and to eat their fill of the delectable seed.

  Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the path through the maze. The 
short grass is soft and spongy, which springs back into place, leaving no 
footprints nor any trace of passage. There is a stray apple lying on the 
ground, nestled comfortably underneath a section of the hedges. A soft 
snuffling can be heard, very faintly, but the creature who is making this

  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

  A small creek crosses the path through the hedges and a low wooden planked 
bridge crosses it. To either side of the bridge you can see the water flowing
slowly over the stones. The hedges have actually been cut straight over the

inside the glass encased lantern, pushing away the darkness before it creeps 
in.

A path through the hedges
  The hedges are a little unkempt and could used a slight pruning. The extended
growth is a lighter green to the main plant and they wave around in the 
breeze as it passes by. Bright yellow daisies, with black centres, are 
beginning to open up their petals as they wake up in their home among the 
grass. A couple of bees are busily collecting the virgin pollen from this new
growth of life.

  A small pond glistens in the light, its clear blue waters rippling in the 
wake of the little yellow ducklings that swim across the surface. Tulips of 
red and yellow grow in small groups around the perimeter of the pond. Lamp 
posts are placed at intervals near the hedges, and fireflies buzz around 
inside the glass encased lantern, pushing away the darkness before it creeps 
in.

The centre of the maze (G)
  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

Mushrooms and snails
  The tall, leafy hedges tower over the grassy path, casting deep shadows and 
cooling the air noticeably. The dark green leaves are almost black in the 
perpetual shade and mushrooms grow in abundance, lending their own unique, 
pungent odour to the area. A couple of snails creep along ground, leaving 
silver slimy trails in their wake.

  Leafy hedges rustle in the gentle breeze, stirring them to life. Birds 
twitter and chirp in glorious song as they sing to each other. The grass 
underfoot is a vibrant green, with little pink flowers springing forth 
randomly, scattered all about. A soft snuffling and snorting seems to be 
coming from the nearby hedges, but you cannot see the actual source.

Tall hedges and soft grasses
  So many corridors in the garden maze look the same, the hedges are tall and 
dark leafed and, for the most part, pretty well kept. The grasses are spongy 
and soft and, now and then, small grass growing flowers blossom, showing 
their beautiful petals to the sun. Occasionally a stray apple or autumn leaf 
can be seen on the ground, their colours and sizes different from that of the
last.

[ Exits: north south ]
     A shiny apple glints in the sun.
(Golden Aura) Pure white butterflies flitter around each other.

Intersecting birdseed
  An intersection of pathways in the garden is adorned by the presence of a 
birdbath. A beautifully hand carved masterpiece, with multiple tiers of 
shallow dishes, is filled with fresh water and the top tier is filled with 
bird seed. Small birds frequently visit, to splash around in the water in 
play and to eat their fill of the delectable seed.

Tall hedges and soft grasses
  So many corridors in the garden maze look the same, the hedges are tall and 
dark leafed and, for the most part, pretty well kept. The grasses are spongy 
and soft and, now and then, small grass growing flowers blossom, showing 
their beautiful petals to the sun. Occasionally a stray apple or autumn leaf 
can be seen on the ground, their colours and sizes different from that of the
last.

Nature's perfume
  The leaves on the hedges wave around a little in the light wind that also 
brings the perfume of numerous flowers with it, tickling the hairs of your 
nose slightly. A stray autumn leaf drifts past you, slowly floating backwards
and forwards as it gets closer and closer to the green grass, to lay there 
unmoving. A grasshopper, startled by the leaf's appearance, springs away in a
graceful bound.

A path through the hedges
  Tall hedges with dark green leaves line the path through the maze. The soft 
grass is a vibrant green and smells fresh and crisp, as though after a light 
sun shower. The grass is spongy and quick to bounce back, leaving no visible 
footprints. Quite out of place amongst the green of the path is a 
beautifully formed autumn leaf, which matches the liquid amber tree in the

  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

A path through the hedges
  Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the path through the maze. The 
short grass is soft and spongy, which springs back into place, leaving no 
footprints nor any trace of passage. There is a stray apple lying on the 
ground, nestled comfortably underneath a section of the hedges. A soft 
snuffling can be heard, very faintly, but the creature who is making this 
sound is hidden from view.

     A juicy red apple is ready to eat.

Dragonflies and caterpillars
  Tall hedges line the garden maze, directing your path through twists and 
turns, before returning you back to the centre tree. Butterflies flutter and 
flitter around the blossoms of the flowering plants and dragonflies hover in 
mid air, before darting away. A fuzzy brown caterpillar inches along a juicy 
green leaf, looking for an ideal one to munch upon. The heady perfume of 
nearby flowers fills your senses.

Intersecting birdseed
  An intersection of pathways in the garden is adorned by the presence of a 
birdbath. A beautifully hand carved masterpiece, with multiple tiers of 
shallow dishes, is filled with fresh water and the top tier is filled with 
bird seed. Small birds frequently visit, to splash around in the water in 
play and to eat their fill of the delectable seed.

Tall, dark and leafy
  Tall and dark leafy hedges guide your path through the garden maze, shutting 
out all visions of the world outside. The sounds from the world beyond the 
hedges cannot penetrate the barrier either, like it is magically protecting 
all within from outside interference. Some small dragonflies hover around the
leaves, attracted by something you cannot see nor smell, completely unmindful
of your presence.

Contemplating colours
  The path ends when the tall, leafy hedges block the way forward. A 
beautifully carved marble fountain, with sculptures of dolphins and mermaids,
frozen forever in various poses, bubbles merrily. The water in the fountain 
is a kaleidoscope of colours, slowly changing hues as the water flows forth 
from the spouts in the marble figures. Wrought iron seats ring the fountain, 
placed at widely spaced intervals, and garden beds of colourful petunias 
grace the empty spaces in between.

Tall hedges and soft grasses
  So many corridors in the garden maze look the same, the hedges are tall and 
dark leafed and, for the most part, pretty well kept. The grasses are spongy 
and soft and, now and then, small grass growing flowers blossom, showing 
their beautiful petals to the sun. Occasionally a stray apple or autumn leaf 
can be seen on the ground, their colours and sizes different from that of the
last.

twitter and chirp in glorious song as they sing to each other. The grass 
underfoot is a vibrant green, with little pink flowers springing forth 
randomly, scattered all about. A soft snuffling and snorting seems to be 
coming from the nearby hedges, but you cannot see the actual source.

  A rustling of the leaves coming from the hedge beside you indicates you are

  The tall, leafy hedges tower over the grassy path, casting deep shadows and 
cooling the air noticeably. The dark green leaves are almost black in the 
perpetual shade and mushrooms grow in abundance, lending their own unique,

A garden path
  Large stone blocks form a path that runs through a delightful garden. The 
path is well cared for, which shows in the absence of weeds and grasses 
growing up in spaces between the stones. The blocks are of various natural 
shapes and sizes, which fit together perfectly and they have a rough finish 
to them. On either side of the path is a row of yellow and red tulips, in no 
particular pattern, that leads right up to a gate in the hedge wall to the

around the flowers, collecting their pollen and blood red roses adorn the 
thorny bushes at either side of the entrance to the gazebo. Inside, seats 
line the walls, and the grassy floor is well cared for.

A grassy intersection
  The leafy hedges part to allow another path to intersect with the one you are
on. In the centre of the three way intersection is a pile of apples, 
deliberately placed there and stacked knee-high to an elf. A fuzzy brown 
caterpillar crawls over the top most apple and a worm pokes its head out from
a hole in another one.

[ Exits: north south west ]

>>    Pots 'n paradise
  A two-tiered wooden bench sits in front of the southern wall of hedges and 
contains a wondrous variety of flowers in terracotta pots. A couple of the 
pots have been knocked over and the delicate plants inside have toppled out 
and to the ground. Inside one of the now vacant pots is a hedgehog, all 
curled up and sleeping. The air smells earthy from the spilled soil and the 
little hedgehog is snorting and snuffling in its sleep.

[ Exits: east west ]

A grassy intersection
  The leafy hedges part to allow another path to intersect with the one you are
on. In the centre of the three way intersection is a pile of apples, 
deliberately placed there and stacked knee-high to an elf. A fuzzy brown 
caterpillar crawls over the top most apple and a worm pokes its head out from
a hole in another one.

Leafy disturbances
  There has been a disturbance in the hedges to the east, some of the branches 
have been snapped and leaves litter the ground. It looks like something was 
trying to cross through the hedges. You can't know if it succeeded without 
giving it a go yourself. The garden is supposed to be safe from predators, it
would be devastating if one had managed to find its way in.

Tomatoes and capsicums
  Right up near the hedges, the tomatoes have been staked and tied, yet still 
bend over under the heavy burden of their fruits. A few varieties of 
capsicums and peppers have also been staked up, their colourful bounty not as
heavy as that of the tomatoes. Juicy, red tomatoes are ready for the pickings
and some are already gently stacked in wooden pails that sit on the ground 
nearby.

Tall hedges and soft grasses
  So many corridors in the garden maze look the same, the hedges are tall and 
dark leafed and, for the most part, pretty well kept. The grasses are spongy 
and soft and, now and then, small grass growing flowers blossom, showing 
their beautiful petals to the sun. Occasionally a stray apple or autumn leaf 
can be seen on the ground, their colours and sizes different from that of the
last.

[ Exits: north south ]
     A shiny apple glints in the sun.
(Golden Aura) A snail creeps around on its large slimy foot, leaving a trail of silver behind.

Green grass and pink flowers (G)
  Leafy hedges rustle in the gentle breeze, stirring them to life. Birds 
twitter and chirp in glorious song as they sing to each other. The grass 
underfoot is a vibrant green, with little pink flowers springing forth 
randomly, scattered all about. A soft snuffling and snorting seems to be 
coming from the nearby hedges, but you cannot see the actual source.

[ Exits: north east south ]
     A yellow and brown autumn leaf lies on the ground.
(Golden Aura) A flycatcher chirps its glorious song.

  A rustling of the leaves coming from the hedge beside you indicates you are 
not alone. The source of the commotion cannot be seen, but sounds like 
something small pushing its way through the internals of the leafy hedge. A 
small red apple sits at the base of the hedge, almost lost to sight.

     A red apple lies up against the hedges.
(Golden Aura) A flycatcher chirps its glorious song.

Mushrooms and snails
  The tall, leafy hedges tower over the grassy path, casting deep shadows and 
cooling the air noticeably. The dark green leaves are almost black in the 
perpetual shade and mushrooms grow in abundance, lending their own unique, 
pungent odour to the area. A couple of snails creep along ground, leaving 
silver slimy trails in their wake.

The centre of the maze (G)
  A beautiful liquid amber tree, its red and yellow leaves already beginning to
fall, is the centre piece of this delightful garden. There is a very 
comfortable pile of amber leaves under the eaves of the tree and the grass 
looks springy and soft. Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the paths 
through the garden, creating a small and easy to navigate maze. The merry 
tinkle of water can be heard in the distance and the twittering of birds is 
like music to the ears.

Birds and butterflies
  The leafy hedges, tall and green, line the path through the garden. Pure 
white butterflies flitter around, dancing with each other as they fly through
the air, their wings glimmering in the light. Birds twitter merrily as they 
swoop and dart about, very comfortable with the level of safety from 
predators. The garden is a safe haven for the smaller creatures as there 
really is no way in nor out, that you can see.

>>    Leafy disturbances
  There has been a disturbance in the hedges to the east, some of the branches 
have been snapped and leaves litter the ground. It looks like something was 
trying to cross through the hedges. You can't know if it succeeded without 
giving it a go yourself. The garden is supposed to be safe from predators, it
would be devastating if one had managed to find its way in.

A solitude of flowers (G)
  A low, round gazebo, painted white and covered with climbing plants, is 
waiting in quiet solitude. Wisteria vines grow prolifically up the sides of 
the gazebo and the tiny purple flowers emit a heavy perfume. Small bees buzz 
around the flowers, collecting their pollen and blood red roses adorn the 
thorny bushes at either side of the entrance to the gazebo. Inside, seats 
line the walls, and the grassy floor is well cared for.

Pots 'n paradise
  A two-tiered wooden bench sits in front of the southern wall of hedges and 
contains a wondrous variety of flowers in terracotta pots. A couple of the 
pots have been knocked over and the delicate plants inside have toppled out 
and to the ground. Inside one of the now vacant pots is a hedgehog, all 
curled up and sleeping. The air smells earthy from the spilled soil and the 
little hedgehog is snorting and snuffling in its sleep.

A path through the hedges
  Tall hedges with dark green leaves line the path through the maze. The soft 
grass is a vibrant green and smells fresh and crisp, as though after a light 
sun shower. The grass is spongy and quick to bounce back, leaving no visible 
footprints. Quite out of place amongst the green of the path is a 
beautifully formed autumn leaf, which matches the liquid amber tree in the 
centre of the garden.

Nature's perfume
  The leaves on the hedges wave around a little in the light wind that also 
brings the perfume of numerous flowers with it, tickling the hairs of your 
nose slightly. A stray autumn leaf drifts past you, slowly floating backwards
and forwards as it gets closer and closer to the green grass, to lay there 
unmoving. A grasshopper, startled by the leaf's appearance, springs away in a
graceful bound.

grass nearby is squishy and little puddles of water form momentarily in the 
footprints left behind. A trio of black and orange butterflies dance along 
the dark hedges, sparkling in the sunlight.

Dirty disturbances
  In a quiet corner of the garden maze there looks to have been a recent 
commotion in the hedge, like something has been using it as a place to hide.
While, for the most part, the grass is soft and spongy, the ground underneath
the hedge is bare dirt. There is definitely signs of a disturbance on the 
ground and some of the lower branches seem to be broken off. Perhaps it is 
worth investigating ...

  Leafy hedges rustle in the gentle breeze, stirring them to life. Birds 
twitter and chirp in glorious song as they sing to each other. The grass 
underfoot is a vibrant green, with little pink flowers springing forth 
randomly, scattered all about. A soft snuffling and snorting seems to be 
coming from the nearby hedges, but you cannot see the actual source.

Tall hedges and soft grasses
  So many corridors in the garden maze look the same, the hedges are tall and 
dark leafed and, for the most part, pretty well kept. The grasses are spongy 
and soft and, now and then, small grass growing flowers blossom, showing 
their beautiful petals to the sun. Occasionally a stray apple or autumn leaf 
can be seen on the ground, their colours and sizes different from that of the
last.

Dragonflies and caterpillars (2051)

A path through the hedges
  Tall hedges, with dark green leaves, line the path through the maze. The 
short grass is soft and spongy, which springs back into place, leaving no 
footprints nor any trace of passage. There is a stray apple lying on the 
ground, nestled comfortably underneath a section of the hedges. A soft 
snuffling can be heard, very faintly, but the creature who is making this 
sound is hidden from view.

[ Exits: north south west ]
     A juicy red apple is ready to eat.
(Golden Aura) A fuzzy brown caterpillar is looking for a leaf to munch on.
(Golden Aura) A hedgehog is sleeping under a hedge.
(Golden Aura) A rainbow lorikeet flies through the air in a flash of bright colours.

air in the tunnels. The small, pure white, fuzzy roots from the grasses on

A warm, earthy tunnel
  The air in the tunnels is quite warm and a little humid. The walls, floor and
ceiling are all made from the same rich, brown soil and it would appear that 
a magical force is keeping the tunnel from collapsing in on itself. The 
ground underfoot is quite solid, but still soft enough to leave footprints 
behind. There are many kinds of tracks on the tunnel floor from the various 
life forms that live underground.

  The air in the tunnels is quite warm and a little humid. The walls, floor and
ceiling are all made from the same rich, brown soil and it would appear that 
a magical force is keeping the tunnel from collapsing in on itself. The

behind. There are many kinds of tracks on the tunnel floor from the various

  Roots from the hedges growing on the surface snake down the earthen walls, 
their white skins glowing against the deep brown of the soil. The ground 
underfoot is soft and earthy and is covered in multiple foot and paw prints.
The air is humid and warm, and very, very ripe, making breathing a little 
difficult at times. Sounds are muffled and are absorbed into the walls of the
tunnels making it difficult to determine where any particular noise is coming
from.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     (Magic) A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     (Magic) Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.
