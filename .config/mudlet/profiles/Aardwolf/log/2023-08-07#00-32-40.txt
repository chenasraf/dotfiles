An alcove
  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its
walls are lined by smaller pillars that you saw in the hall.  In the center
there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.  

[ Exits: south ]
(White Aura) A cracked statue is placed here giving off an eerie glow.
A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

A cracked statue says 'You shall battle the light on your way to the prize.'
The lightside of the coin
  Staring out across the edge of the citadel you can see the land of
Aardwolf whisking by.  You can hear the joy and feel the warmth from within
the small town that lies to the north.  Looking up into the clouds, past the
city, you see the goal of this journey.  Somewhere in that tower lies the
relic you seek.

A back alley
  The way you came is now gone and you find yourself in a back alley.  The
alley walls are high and too flat to get any traction to climb.  The ground
has garbage on it; luckily not much light gets back here so it is not
rotten.  Noises come to you from the opening leading from the alley into the
main part of town.

The main street
  You are greeted by the sound of a cart coming to a halt on a cobblestone
street.  This seems like a thing from one of those sickening faerie tales:
everyone getting along, smiling, and helping each other.  Hopefully you will
not have to put up with this sickening place much longer.

The southern square
  Centaur children who are frolicking and having a great deal of fun
inhabit the southern part of the square.  A few trees are here granting
shade to all those who wish to spend the day relaxing on the grass.  A
breeze comes from the north and carries with it the smells of wild flowers
and honeysuckle.

The northern square
  Wild flowers and honeysuckle are scattered throughout the grass.  Two
trees have a rope tied between them that children are using to play a rather
strange game.  The parents look on with warmth in their hearts at the fact
that their children are not troubled by the war.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers

  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we

do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

Boot Clan Public Hall (G)
  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)

At the Town Gates of Dharivian
  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

  The labyrinth continues.  It's amazing how one's sense of smell develops
when one's eyes are useless in the unending dark.  An acrid, sour odor rises
abruptly, strong enough to make one cough, eyes watering.  Those who have
owned a pet kitten that ignores its litter box will recognize the odor
immediately.  Something feline is around here marking its territory. 
Hopefully it's a very small feline.  Maybe you'll run into it by heading
north or west.

  Another dead end appears abruptly.  With the wild growth of greenery
unaffected by the Queen's magic, and taking the darkness into account, it's
not at all easy to discern the end of the corridor without bumping into it. 
Stumbling around a bit more might be rewarded with a clash of metal, as a

A Dead End in the Labyrinth
  Once again, you find a dead end in the labyrinth.  No matter how far you
go, everything looks the same.  The branches of the deathberry hedges are
harder than iron, and impossible to break or cut.  The weave of the tough
wood is tight enough that not even the smallest adventurer could squeeze
through and an occasional indentation shows that the shrubbery must be
several feet in thickness.  Even if the hedges did not form a confining
ceiling, long sharp thorns discourage climbing.  The only possible direction
to go from here is east.

A Dead End in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth corridor stops at another dead end, the hedges closing
together so abruptly it would be easy to bump one's nose on them.  Of
course, this wouldn't be a very healthy thing to do with all the deathberry
thorns around.  The situation is even worse here, where the green
surroundings have escaped the Queen's magic and grown in a wild burst.  The
thorns here are plentiful, ten times the amount found in most parts of the
maze.

A Dead End in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth comes to a sudden dead end.  This is, perhaps, the darkest
of the local corridors, although worse darkness can be found even deeper in
the maze.  The deathberry hedges here show signs of being hacked, perhaps by
a frantic prisoner.  The branches, though, being as hard as iron, or harder,
resisted all but a few shallow cuts.  The powerful blows that must have been
inflicted on the shrubbery limbs may be, in one way, reassuring, or at least
informative.  If something that had the ability to even scratch the
poisonous plant could not make a dent, perhaps it's not so bad that you
cannot do it even that much.  In any case, one might head south, if he or
she were trying to escape the labyrinth.

  Another dead end is reached and pretty much the only way to detect that
fact is to bump into the closed hedge.  Thankfully, many have done this
before, and most of the poisonous thorns in the shrubbery have been broken
and dropped to the ground.  That would also explain the corpses lying around
on the short grass here, fertilizing it.  The stench is incredible.  Better
head back east to recover from it.

A Dead End in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  The ground shakes now and then, as if a
massive being nearby is stomping along the maze corridors, and not even the
fine, soft grass underfoot can cushion the giant footsteps.  A quiet corner
has been cleared of the poisonous deathberries, and beneath a weeping willow
tree a little campsite has been erected.  Okay, so it's a large campsite, to
judge from the huge shelter that has been constructed of deadfall wood. 
Pieces of cotton batting the size of watermelons, the kind used in stuffed
animal toys, apparently serve as pillows.  They look more comfortable than
anything else in the maze; perhaps you have time for a quick nap before
heading back to the west.

  Here we have yet another dead end in the labyrinth.  The deathberry

the cause, there's no sense in remaining here.  You can head south back into

  The labyrinth hits a dead end again.  Very little light filters into
this part of the maze, the lack of brightness hovering between evening and
dead of night.  It's best to walk carefully, for even your own toes are
difficult to discern.  Now and then bright red spots appear in the haze, but
it's hard to tell if they are simply more deathberries, or crimson eyes
watching you, planning vile acts against your person.  Maybe you ought to
head back north while you still can.

  The labyrinth suddenly ends again, forming a quiet little cul-de-sac.  A
community of dog-like creatures have set up their home here.  Grass from
other parts of the maze has been gathered and painstakingly woven into
little round beds and a fallen log partially blocks off this section from
the rest of the maze.  You can still head back to the west if you wish,
though.

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave

A Quiet Meadow
  Soft breezes sway the long grasses invitingly.  A slight scent of seawater
drifts from the north where you can just see a rocky outcropping.  Looking
around, you are slightly puzzled.  To the best of your recollection there
was once a quaint little village here.  A well-trodden path leads north
towards the sound of waves crashing against rocks.

Overlooking a Newly Formed Sea (G)
  Gazing out, all you see is an endless expanse of water.  Far, far below
the waves crash against jagged slices of shoreline.  A thin stretch of beach
is barely visible at the base of the cliffs, and that might just be another
being standing at the water's edge.  The main path continues on right over
the cliff's edge, as if there used to be land there and a place for the path
to go.  Looking around for a possible way down, you spy a fresh trail
heading off to the east.

  At last, you place your feet on solid ground.  Looking up, you can hardly
believe that you actually were able to make it down the cliff unscathed. 
The beach stretches out before you, inviting you to stroll along and
discover the local flora and fauna.  Everywhere you see rampant signs of
flourishing life.  Tide pools teem with small, scurrying creatures and
shells glisten in the sunlight.  All in all, it is a rather picturesque
place.  Further ahead you can make out with certainty the form of a little
green man gazing out over the waters.  Maybe now you can finally find out

There seems to be an abundance of life everywhere...  The sands are patterned
with strange, wavering lines, as if something has crawled from the sea to

to get your bearings.  To your left you can see a small cave, virtually
undetectable without close examination.  To the north, the coral closes in
again, with barely enough room for you to pass.

Deep in the Coral
  The coral walls close in around you as you travel deeper into this
realm of sea snakes.  Luckily, you are able to use these same walls
to keep yourself from being swept away by the current.  To the west
you can see another cave.  A quick push in that direction should be
enough to get you out of the rush of water.  As you brace to shove
off, you feel a give in the opposite wall.
 
Is that a sign hidden in the coral?

Deep in the Coral
  The waters finally calm, and you are able to stand almost upright and

The Center of the Coral Reef
  A sheer vista opens before you.  Here the walls of coral rise into a
splendid pinnacle.  Grandiose designs have been etched into it by the ebb
and flow of water.  A giant archway spans the top of the northern wall,
dwarfing the exit below it.  The sheer beauty of this room almost makes
you forget that evil is afoot, and that you have pledged your aid.

painstakingly from the stone, its size seems even greater.  Crafted out of

for battle.  The journey to this place has been nothing compared to what you

Lair of the Blithersnag
  This is just a typical blithersnag lair.  It's fairly cozy, with a pile
of animal furs in one corner to sleep on.  Bones of unlucky travelers can
also be seen scattered about.  A couple of males work while the female roars
and snorts.  You hope she doesn't see you.

The Puppet and the Dwarf
  What an odd place to find a tavern.  But that is exactly what this seems
to be.  Or at least half a tavern.  A bar is cut into the rock and a rusty
sign above it states: 
 
     The Puppet and the Dwarf
 

[ Exits: north south ]
     (Invis) (Cursed) A pair of shades lies here.
(Golden Aura) A bluish dwarf scratches his ample rump.

  Leaving the tavern you wonder if you have not taken too much drink. 
Paths lead east and west in the most arbitrary of fashions.  No signpost
stands here to aid your decision.  The mineral abundance mesmerizes you. 
Rare jewels and unknown ores ogle you from the cracks and seams of these
caverns.  Odd little creatures tramp by as well, some carrying sparkling
trophies.

>>    Ravine of Skulls [**> PK <**]
  Descending even deeper into this dark realm, you find yourself in a
narrow ravine with high rock walls.  The ground is littered with ugly oblong
skulls.  No armor is to be seen, so perhaps they were a primitive race. 
Despite the bleakness of the ravine, the mineral richness you encounter
continues to dazzle you.  Large green emeralds sparkle in the obsidian-like
rock that surrounds you.  Threading your way through pits of quicksand, you
see a trail leading south.

  More skulls crunch beneath your boots.  More emeralds sparkle in the
gloom.  Occasionally a large bat lurches past, its shrill cry piercing the
silence.  It is so dry and barren here, you feel like you are in an
underground desert.  After a bit, the ravine veers east.

  At last, you place your feet on solid ground.  Looking up, you can hardly
believe that you actually were able to make it down the cliff unscathed. 
The beach stretches out before you, inviting you to stroll along and
discover the local flora and fauna.  Everywhere you see rampant signs of
flourishing life.  Tide pools teem with small, scurrying creatures and
shells glisten in the sunlight.  All in all, it is a rather picturesque
place.  Further ahead you can make out with certainty the form of a little
green man gazing out over the waters.  Maybe now you can finally find out

  Finally, you have reached the water's edge.  Here stands the man you saw
from atop the cliffs.  What is this that he has handed you?  His gaze turns
back out to the turbulent sea, his face sinking into an expression of deep
sadness.  Looking past him, you see a drop off in the shoreline.  There is a
faint luminescence in the water, almost as if a path has been outlined on
the sea's floor.  Perhaps a closer look is worthwhile.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.

An Amethyst Sea (G)
  You now float deep in a strange sea that sparkles as if it were made of
liquid amethyst.  Perhaps it is no more than a drop distilled from the magic
of Zangar.  In any case, you are in it, and rather lost.  All is flux and
convolution.  Strange sea creatures come and go, and what first appear to be
sedentary clams scramble about when you take your eyes off of them.

in rough caverns, but in a spacious room with blue marble walls.  Stairs

  You now stand facing the coldly gleaming obsidian throne of Zangar.  It
is empty.  Hideous gargoyle statues sit on each side.  Fire pits hold a dark
burning wood that remains unconsumed even as flames gives off an eerie
bluish light that dances with the shadows.  You look into a mirror on one
wall and see not your reflection, but images of regions of the grotto you
have so recently traveled.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  Going down this trail seems easy.  The sun's shining down, warming up
everything and birds are chirping in the trees.  You better hope that no
dangerous creatures are out there lurking around.  With all the rustling in
the bushes, there might be a bear coming, if they have those sort of
creatures.  If talking trees are all you have to deal with, this journey
might just be a pleasant one.

Edge of Teutonia
  You're finally getting close to Teutonia!  As you look into the valley,
you see the village, so small and peaceful looking.  If you keep going,
perhaps you'll make it into town before dark settles in.  No more camping
outside for you!  Hopefully the people will be friendly....

  This little town looks so picturesque!  As you walk down the red
cobblestone street, you notice that all the stone houses have thatched
roofs.  The villagers all look peaceful and happy.  Ahead appears a huge
stone castle topped with bright red parapets, and on top of all four towers
are white flags with red emblems.  Maybe now that you've finally arrived,
someone can tell you what you are doing here.

Entrance of Castle
  You're finally at the castle's entrance.  Hopefully someone will let you
in so you can see the emperor.  Finally you'll get the answers to your
questions.  That is if they know why you are here as well.  Maybe you won't
need an invitation to get in either...  North is the castle's gates if this
guard lets you by.

East Castle Trail
  Walking along this path around the castle sure is peaceful, but where
does it lead you?  Hopefully it will take you to the north where Nefarious
lives so you can finally get some straight answers on this war.  Why did
they have to pick you?  The sun is shining and birds are singing, things
seem too peaceful for there to be a war.  Maybe they lied to you.  Maybe
there really isn't a war and you're their pawn in their little game.  To the
east you see more forest and you hope that this trip won't take as long as
the first one did.  Or perhaps you should just stay at the castle?

Forest Path
  Following this path is a whole lot easier than before.  This place
actually seems a bit more hospitable than the path you took to Teutonia. 
For as long as you can see, all there are are birds and fruit trees, no
snakes or trolls.  A soft roaring is the only other sound you hear.  You
must be coming up to a river.  Wanting to get a cool drink, you pick up your
pace, but should you really hurry?  Lord knows what is out there waiting for
you!  Perhaps you should pace yourself, Nefarious doesn't know you're
coming, or so you think...

  This room is beautiful, just like the one you were just in, but something
makes it have a extra glow to it.  The table is a deep reddish brown and is
set with wonderful foods.  You had forgotten your hunger but now as you
stare at succulent meats and fresh bread, it growls with impatience.  But
you MUST find the Emperor first, perhaps this man standing before you knows
where he is.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

A Beauteous Courtyard
  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...

Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic
lord.

A Beauteous Courtyard
  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...  

[ Exits: east west ]
You flee from combat!
You lose 10 exp for your cowardice.

WeaponGuy Tech: I'm trying to use an online timer to show double experence. So, I'm using triggers
to turn it on and off when there's double xp and when it ends. So, if I see the timer running, I 
know there's double XP. But it isn't going away with that command.

set it to zero and turn it off. It'll show zero, instead of going away.

Epsilon Tech: I appreciate the concept of "I really want to mess with this 'til it works," but using
the tick eliminates the time pressure ("omg so much missed double! D:") and might let you look at

The Palace of Perfection
  Sweet perfume wafts with every movement here, enticing and tantalizing. 
Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic
lord.

  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.
 
There is a brightly-colored poster here.

The central stairwell (G)
  This central location in the tower is brightly lit, though you do not
see any light source. A spiral staircase makes its way up to the landing,
before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through
the halls, much of it going to the shops on the next floor. Shadows flicker
lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the
south.

Bard Clan Hall (G)
  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.
 
There is a brightly-colored poster here.

do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a

respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits

laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but

on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

>>    The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  To the north is the grandest castle of all- that owned by the King
himself, and from which he administers the land.

A Beauteous Courtyard
  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...

  Sweet perfume wafts with every movement here, enticing and tantalizing. 
Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic
lord.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

>>    The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

>>    Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

  Almost as formidable as the gates at the City's entrance, these protect
Pandemonium's nobility from invasion of their elite sanctum.  The road
slopes upward sharply, as if discouraging would-be treaders, and the City
Guard stationed at the gate itself looks none too friendly.

>>    The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

A Beauteous Courtyard
  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...

Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic
lord.

The Palace of Perfection
  Sweet perfume wafts with every movement here, enticing and tantalizing. 
Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic
lord.
