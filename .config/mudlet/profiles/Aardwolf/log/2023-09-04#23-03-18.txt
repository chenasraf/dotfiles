  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Lobby of the Bonded Guildbase (G)
  For what is essentially a waiting room, this one really isn't too bad. 
It's clean, with torches casting a soft light easy on the eyes.  The wooden
walls have been painted a blue any sky would be proud to wear, so nice and
soothing.  A few tiny trees in ebony tubs occupy the corners, while
individual cushioned chairs are provided for visitors to rest after their
long journey to the Bonded Guild.  Books stand neatly on glass-topped
endtables to entertain as well.  Over it all presides a pretty receptionist
who always manages to remain polite but firm.

A Short Hallway
  The hallway is rather quiet, without a soul to be seen here.  It's large
enough that three people can walk through it abreast, a torch sconce on the
walls every ten feet or so.  It's more plain than the lobby, the wooden
walls unpainted.  A thin dirt-brown carpet does line the floor in
consideration of weary, aching feet.

A Grassy Path
  Old trees tower high overhead on either side of this wide path, leaning
in to form a leafy canopy overhead.  Sunlight filtering through dapples the
grass, and warms the air just enough to be comfortable without causing
sweat.  It's a rather pleasant environment marred only by the panicked
screams of animals coming from beyond the wooden fence to the north.

A Rolling Meadow (1234)

A Rolling Meadow
  This little meadow nestles within the semicircle of mountain to the west
and the north, which makes it a lot easier to keep livestock contained and
makes for less worries about fence repair.  Horses and cattle are both kept
here, meals on the hoof for dragons and humans alike.  The surroundings are
rather pleasant, with lush grass, sheltering oaks, and a small stream that
sings like crystal, but there's a strong atmosphere of tension here.  These
animals know their purpose.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Approaching the Dread Tower
  As you exit the forest and begin approaching the tower, the shadows move
around you in what appear to be fingers clawing at your person.  You realize
something powerful and evil lives here.  The tower is by far the tallest
thing you have ever seen, and as you approach you notice that it isn't
resting on the bloodstained earth, but rather hovering above it.  What kind
of being could have such power to do this?

Crumbling Field
  This field is slowly crumbling into the rushing river to the east. As you 
watch, more and more of the unprotected shoreline ripples away into the 
thunderous water. To the northwest, a small forest broods over the fields all
around it. Somewhere eastwards, a small trail collapses into what has become 
known as Kettermoor Crick: the fishy river leading into what is known as 
Mesolar's melting pot of debauchery. One may merely cross the Kettermoor to 
enter Fellchantry.

On the Crickbridge Road
  It was a dark and stormy night...

  There's a saying out in the darker parts of the country that, for a man
in the right kinds of trouble, all roads lead to Fellchantry. They say that
when "No Fear" Narlfryd, the famed Wolfen daredevil, needed a place to lay
low, he came to Fellchantry and knifed a guy over a card game. The story
goes that he wanted to use a vacation in a cell as a chance to let a bad
storm blow over. The authorities didn't give him the chance. They took one
look at that body, shook their heads, and walked the other way. Fellchantry
is just that kind of place. Around here, they're ALL dark and stormy nights,
and the residents like it that way just fine.

  To the east lies the bridge over Kettermoor Crick, the deceptively named
fast-running river that supplies Fellchantry with its ne'erending supply of
fish, trade taxes, and surly attitudes.

Fellchantry Square (1237)

Fellchantry Square (1236)

Brimtoil Alley
  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Further south, the alleyway eventually twists east and out of sight.

on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky

  Here, filled with all manner of sights and smells, is Fellchantry Square.
In the constant hell of the Barony, this is where the honest (and you have
to be flexible on your definition here) citizens come to gossip, barter, and
conduct their necessary business. The square is a microcosm of the city; all
cramped buildings, bustling crowds, and narrow side streets. A guy could get
lost with the slightest wandering from the beaten path, and he probably
wouldn't like where he ended up. The only thing less welcoming than
Fellchantry's main streets are its back alleys.

  The presence of the barony's courthouse to the north does nothing to curb
the traffic of the usual ne'er-do-wells and cutthroats here. For the majority
of the Justiciars-- Fellchantry's city guards-- the pay just isn't good
enough to really make an effort. The occasional drunk gets roughed up, and
a murderer may even be arrested if he's a little too indiscrete, but in the
end it's just keeping up appearances. Who cares about a murder when no one
misses the deceased? Besides, everyone in Fellchantry is guilty of something.

  Justice waits to the north, longing for someone to avenge the slander done
to her name. The square looms predatorily to the east and south.

Justiciar Headquarters
  This aged building, remarkable only in that it's slightly less run down than
the structures around it, is home to His Majesty's Justiciars. From here
Fellchantry's city guards work hard at the appearance of upholding justice.
In reality the guards are only about two steps removed from being criminals
themselves, and the sour reek of tobacco, alcohol, and sweat on the air says
much about the Justiciars' efficacy. Still, the Baron's coat of arms hangs
large on the wall, and that's all the legitimacy these men need.

  His Majesty's Kangaroo Court is in the western wing of the courthouse. To
the south wait the pickpockets and cutpurses of Fellchantry Square.

Fellchantry Square [**> PK <**]
    The signature smell of Fellchantry (jokingly referred to as "Kettermoor
Cologne") wafts in with particular potency from the west, hinting at
the docks to be found in that direction. The aroma, not so much unpleasant
as it is unusual, has strong fishy accents punctuated with less-identifiable
effluvia. Fishmongers exhort the crowds with carny-like shouts, each
extolling the freshness and superiority of their particular wares. The
occasional prostitute wanders through, on their way to providing the
services of Andolor's oldest profession to the dock crowd.

A Cramped Alleyway
  This particular alleyway - unlike many of the others in which the denizens of
Fellchantry conduct their lucrative business - finds itself oddly quiet.
Mayhaps it be that Fellchantry Square itself is the central hustle of the 
settlement, paving the way towards bars, men or women for hire and narrow 
passages offering an escape from day-to-day struggles. Mayhaps, in fact, it 
be that there is actually clean and running water trickling away to the 
north; one could surmise that the town's aversion to anything not coming out

Fellchantry Square
  Here, traffic is heavy. Oft there would be two seperate rows leading to and 
fro the double doors which rest upon rusted hinges to the east, possibly 
never having been closed over decades of being pelted with rain and snow 
until lodged in place permanently. Commotion never ceases amidst merriment 
and the frequent clatter of a good old fashioned brawl among the 
establishment's patrons.
 
To the south and the west Fellchantry Square continues to sprawl out, cobbles
underfoot sodden and trampled deep beneath the earth after years of harried 
abuse.

The Aqueduct
  One may find themselves hard pressed to believe that Fellchantry would have 
any running water save for that of Kettermoor Crick. Nay, not for any reason 
of trade or surly attitudes but for a scent that clings to the air. The stink
of unwashed bodies and alcohol-laden belches may be quite the most telling 
when pondering the aqueduct's purpose - the conclusion anyone would come to 
is that it has none. It could be placed in the running for Andolor's cleanest
water supply if it were not for the disrepair in which the stonework finds

  On occasion the odd wilted sheaf of lettuce would drift its way from the

aqueduct like a small organic mercantile ship. On another occasion, a bubble

signature whiff of stale ale into the air. To the southwest the bustle and 
loud cries of mongers peddling their wares can be heard eminating from 
Fellchantry Square.

The Aqueduct
  If you were to close one eye, tilt your head a bit, and then close your other
eye, you might be able to suss out some details past the first inches of the 
hardly-opaque waters which stream underfoot from the east towards a grate in 
the western wall, eventually plummeting away into darkness. No doubt it leads
to Kettermoor Crick; a wasteful supply, at that. It doesn't smell nearly as 
bad here as it does when one enters Fellchantry's spiked maw to the 
southwest. Alas, silence itself is also quite the rare commodity among the 
ramshackle stone buildings which make up the settlement; one would not need 
to strain their ears to hear the rattling of bars and enraged yells beyond 
the cramped windows in the southern wall.

  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His

  This aged building, remarkable only in that it's slightly less run down than
the structures around it, is home to His Majesty's Justiciars. From here
Fellchantry's city guards work hard at the appearance of upholding justice.
In reality the guards are only about two steps removed from being criminals
themselves, and the sour reek of tobacco, alcohol, and sweat on the air says
much about the Justiciars' efficacy. Still, the Baron's coat of arms hangs
large on the wall, and that's all the legitimacy these men need.

  His Majesty's Kangaroo Court is in the western wing of the courthouse. To

Fellchantry Square (1238)

Fellchantry Square
  The southwestern portion of Fellchantry Square is most notable for being
the location of the city's shopping district, such as it is. Small
mercantile shops abound, each with signs boasting their wares. The largest
of the shops, the general store, boasts a sign reading: "Needful Things
For Sale or Trade." From the flow of traffic in and out of the shop, its
Things must be very Needful indeed.

  To the south marvelous things are for sale. To the north and east
the square offers other amusements.

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the

stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.

Bridge Three
  A tale as old as time, the denizens of Fellchantry have wondered for many 
decades - perhaps centuries - why the very structure which bridges 
Fellchantry Square and the dwelling of His Lordship, Lord Whatshisface, had 
never gotten an official name. Lo, the name of this bridge is carved into the
timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like
tree stumps and their stances that of great sentries who guard the good 
Lord's halls. Lo, they nor their impassive watch comes to a halt.
  
Lo, how snugly their britches fit.

city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.

  A welcome break from the square, buildings of stone and layered over with 
plaster cascade in varying shapes and forms towards the south. Beddings and 
pots provide a surprisingly lush fauna in reflection to the denizens which 
march these cobblestone ways - lords and ladies by any given right, all 
marred with some deformation or another which tells of their past during (or 
perhaps prior to) their stay within Fellchantry. Surely the Barony had seen 
no opulence like this since Valkur himself had fallen.
 
To one's north they would find their gaze fixated upon the many bodies which

The Guild
  The working class of Fellchantry: the Guild is a simple stone building which 
one may mistake for a tavern or bar at a glance. Tables and chairs are 
littered across the area in no particular pattern. At the far western edge of
the room is a long, wide bar, the wall behind it lined with wooden shelves 
housing a large selection of liquors with no label or indication of what it 
may be, though whatever barkeep may be servicing the organization's members 
seems to know exactly what lies where, what goes into what, and which 
concoction to conjure. Upon the northern and southern walls are a scattering 
of mis-matched decor. Right next to a large tapestry is a taxidermied boar's 
head, or an emblem with crossed swords embossed upon a wooden panel would 
hang askew, teetering on the edge of harpooning the skull of whoever may find 
themselves beneath it should it eventually decide to fall.

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

  A tale as old as time, the denizens of Fellchantry have wondered for many 
decades - perhaps centuries - why the very structure which bridges 
Fellchantry Square and the dwelling of His Lordship, Lord Whatshisface, had 
never gotten an official name. Lo, the name of this bridge is carved into the
timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like

cleaned. Smoke hangs in the air as thick as the noise generated by the 
milling of bodies and full-bellied laughter.

Baron's Beerhouse
  A quieter corner of the beerhouse, though merely in comparison as opposed to 
fact or widely accepted truth, laughter can be heard rolling through the area
from all directions. More broody folk appear to make themselves at home here,
corner tables and chairs allowing a decent view of the area, though spaced 
apart enough for some to enjoy their drinks in relative solitude. The wall 
sconces here are caked to the brim with old wax, the idea of replenishing the
candles in this spot a long forgotten memory.

To the south one may find the beerhouse's exit.

    The signature smell of Fellchantry (jokingly referred to as "Kettermoor
Cologne") wafts in with particular potency from the west, hinting at
the docks to be found in that direction. The aroma, not so much unpleasant
as it is unusual, has strong fishy accents punctuated with less-identifiable
effluvia. Fishmongers exhort the crowds with carny-like shouts, each
extolling the freshness and superiority of their particular wares. The
occasional prostitute wanders through, on their way to providing the
services of Andolor's oldest profession to the dock crowd.

feature of His Majesty's Court of Justice. On it is a simple judge's bench,
its face decorated with the Baron's coat of arms. Those wondering about the
Baron's views on justice can find their questions answered by the large
painting that totally dominates the wall behind the bench. Simply titled,
"Justice," it depicts a woman with a radiant halo and pure white vestments
holding a sword aloft with one elegantly-sandled foot atop a pile of corpses.
It's not exactly the sort of court at whose mercy one throws oneself.
Non-descript hardwood benches are arranged in two aisles so that the

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.

Fellchantry Square
  The southwestern portion of Fellchantry Square is most notable for being
the location of the city's shopping district, such as it is. Small
mercantile shops abound, each with signs boasting their wares. The largest
of the shops, the general store, boasts a sign reading: "Needful Things
For Sale or Trade." From the flow of traffic in and out of the shop, its
Things must be very Needful indeed.

  To the south marvelous things are for sale. To the north and east
the square offers other amusements.

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

Brimtoil Alley
  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Further south, the alleyway eventually twists east and out of sight.

  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the 
closer one moves towards the hulking drawbridge which lies eastwards and is 
stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.
 
To the north, south and west, the Square continues to sprawl out and avail 
itself of the free (yet more dangerous) space offered here.

Bridge Three
  A tale as old as time, the denizens of Fellchantry have wondered for many 
decades - perhaps centuries - why the very structure which bridges 
Fellchantry Square and the dwelling of His Lordship, Lord Whatshisface, had 
never gotten an official name. Lo, the name of this bridge is carved into the
timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like
tree stumps and their stances that of great sentries who guard the good 
Lord's halls. Lo, they nor their impassive watch comes to a halt.
  
Lo, how snugly their britches fit.

Bridge Three
  A tale as old as time, the denizens of Fellchantry have wondered for many 
decades - perhaps centuries - why the very structure which bridges 
Fellchantry Square and the dwelling of His Lordship, Lord Whatshisface, had 
never gotten an official name. Lo, the name of this bridge is carved into the
timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like
tree stumps and their stances that of great sentries who guard the good 
Lord's halls. Lo, they nor their impassive watch comes to a halt.
  
Lo, how snugly their britches fit.

Fellchantry Square
  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the 
closer one moves towards the hulking drawbridge which lies eastwards and is 
stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.
 
To the north, south and west, the Square continues to sprawl out and avail 
itself of the free (yet more dangerous) space offered here.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

Fellchantry Square
  Here, filled with all manner of sights and smells, is Fellchantry Square.
In the constant hell of the Barony, this is where the honest (and you have
to be flexible on your definition here) citizens come to gossip, barter, and
conduct their necessary business. The square is a microcosm of the city; all
cramped buildings, bustling crowds, and narrow side streets. A guy could get
lost with the slightest wandering from the beaten path, and he probably
wouldn't like where he ended up. The only thing less welcoming than
Fellchantry's main streets are its back alleys.
 
  The spikes of the raised Kettermoor gate loom to the west like a dragon

mercantile shops abound, each with signs boasting their wares. The largest

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.
  
  The front door leads north back to the square, but who could leave when
their heart's most cherished treasure is bound to be on the next shelf they
see? Stay a while... Stay a while...

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Bottlebreak Alley [**> PK <**]
  The alleyway terminates at this point very much in the same way that it does 
to the north. Most human sounds are either sniffling, coughing or someone 
losing their breakfast. The odour of rum and fish is thick in the air, most 
denizens of Bottlebreak alley mostly not bothering with commerce as opposed 
to the paths closer to Fellchantry Square. Much of the ground has eroded 
here, causing buildings to fall into disrepair and become damaged by small 
rivulets of water which seep through from the far west.

Northwards, a bend leads back to Murder Alley.

Bottlebreak Alley [**> PK <**]
  The smells wafting through this alley are less charming than those elsewhere 
within the Barony, but not bad enough for one to run for the hills. Folk who 
traffic here tend to always have a bottle tucked beneath an arm, however, as 
they move from one seedy tavern to another, eyeing anyone who they may not 
recognize suspiciously. Words can be had about the general odour of unwashed 
bodies, however. The state of the surrounding buildings does not suggest 
dilapidation to the point where its denizens should look and smell the way 
they do, though the feeling of complacency hangs thick in the air.

to the paths closer to Fellchantry Square. Much of the ground has eroded 
here, causing buildings to fall into disrepair and become damaged by small 
rivulets of water which seep through from the far west.

Northwards, a bend leads back to Murder Alley.

  The smells wafting through this alley are less charming than those elsewhere 
within the Barony, but not bad enough for one to run for the hills. Folk who 
traffic here tend to always have a bottle tucked beneath an arm, however, as 
they move from one seedy tavern to another, eyeing anyone who they may not 
recognize suspiciously. Words can be had about the general odour of unwashed 
bodies, however. The state of the surrounding buildings does not suggest 
dilapidation to the point where its denizens should look and smell the way 
they do, though the feeling of complacency hangs thick in the air.

Murder Alley
  A bit of a narrower path between buildings, this area does not seem to 
receive a lot of traffic. The buildings which flank the road to the north and
south are a bit more ramshackle, the air feels a bit colder, and the ground 
is a bit grimier. Upon closer inspection of the northern building, one may 
notice the trademark giving this passage its name. A splash of dark paint 
(someone dropped a bucket, no doubt) smears across the wall, the impact 
having left many spots, giving one the illusion that a throat was cut.

Treadway Alley
  The pleasantries seemingly associated with Treadway Alley continue here, some
tables and chairs scattered about the alley. Frequenters would find 
themselves here reading the new gossip prints of the week over a drink or 
warm beverage and a warm pastry produced from an adjecent bakery. It is clear
that if one were to look for folk with fewer scruples, a journey deeper into 
the network of alleyways may be in order.

A bend in the path leads eastwards, one's northern and western flanks blocked
off by buildings.

smoke among the regulars in this area. Some of the doors against the eastern 
buildings lead towards shops, some to homes, and others to homes with their 
back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of 
varying value. The cobblestones underfoot appear to be dark and glisten 
always, as if moistened under the toil of recent rains despite the 
ever-present overhead gloom.

The alleyway continues to the north and south, westwards lies Bogboil Bridge.

  A curio shop, Magnificent Marceline carries itself upon its reputation.
Chairs and tables dot the space, allowing patrons to have a seat while they 
peruse the weird and wonderful wares that the proprietor of the store has for
sale. Dreamcatchers hang from the ceiling, sporting feathers which may just 
barely brush the heads of taller races. At the far eastern edge of the room 
is a small counter where the owner of the shop tends to purchases, happy to 
make their customers' pockets a wee bit lighter.

though it appears I have failed by postulating that you were aware of the fact."

Mister Goodwin says, "I digress, I shall indulge your inquisitive nature."

Mister Goodwin says, "The boy was bit of a zounderkite, though had heart.  He was drawn to an

Mister Goodwin says, "A jeweled egg, intended as a gift to his inamorata.  I believe her name is...

Mister Goodwin says, "You may deduce that the egg itself's very existence is the source of much
contention, though none had thought to inquire whether I had possession of it.

La Rochelle Row
  A conglomerate of buildings continue to sprawl their way southwards and 
eventually come to an end at an awakward cul de sac, though the brilliant 
white of cobble beneath an eternal gloomy sky have yet to lose their luster 
within the Barony. Yonder west lies perhaps the most inconspicuous building 
of the lot - enough so that one may not place words to it lest they venture 
beyond their vocabulary. Eastwards, however, among the cries of "Ho, lad!" 
for carriageboys rests a grand manor upon evidently rich soil, its gardens 
immaculate and lacking no maintenance. 
 
Northwards La Rochelle Row continues before eventually terminating within
the infamous Fellchantry Square, where a particular entanglement of scents
may remind the denizens of this lovely place of "home".

The Guild
  The working class of Fellchantry: the Guild is a simple stone building which 
one may mistake for a tavern or bar at a glance. Tables and chairs are 
littered across the area in no particular pattern. At the far western edge of
the room is a long, wide bar, the wall behind it lined with wooden shelves 
housing a large selection of liquors with no label or indication of what it 
may be, though whatever barkeep may be servicing the organization's members 
seems to know exactly what lies where, what goes into what, and which 
concoction to conjure. Upon the northern and southern walls are a scattering 
of mis-matched decor. Right next to a large tapestry is a taxidermied boar's 
head, or an emblem with crossed swords embossed upon a wooden panel would 
hang askew, teetering on the edge of harpooning the skull of whoever may find 
themselves beneath it should it eventually decide to fall.

Baron's Beerhouse
  A lofty corner, the great bar of the Baron's Beerhouse runs in a large L 
across the northern and eastern wall, eventually terminating in a small door 
which swings this way and that as bartenders move their way in and out to 
serve the establishment's patrons. Many of the more relaxed, or perhaps 
careless, folk sit here with their backs to the door at the bar's edge, 
jokingly referred to as the "maintenance team" for keeping the taps flowing 
and the kegs empty as payment. Laughter rolls through the air of the 
beerhouse, almost as if trapped in permanent festivity.

Baron's Beerhouse
  Perhaps the busiest corner of the beerhouse, this area has a seating

of the area. A preferred space, no doubt, as these seats appear to be 
permanently occupied by those who would use line of sight to the western 
doors to their advantage. Some call it anxiety, yet others may suggest that 
it is mere precaution given the nature of work conducted in the Barony.

Treadway Alley
  A rather open space for an alley, a multitude of tables and chairs are 
scattered around the area, serving as a quaint space for an outdoor drink or 
smoke among the regulars in this area. Some of the doors against the eastern 
buildings lead towards shops, some to homes, and others to homes with their 
back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of 
varying value. The cobblestones underfoot appear to be dark and glisten 
always, as if moistened under the toil of recent rains despite the 
ever-present overhead gloom.

The alleyway continues to the north and south, westwards lies Bogboil Bridge.

  The quaint atmosphere of Treadway Alley is tantamount here, bars and

The scent of freshly baked confectionary hangs thickly in the air and one may
soon discover that beyond the face-value of Fellchantry rests an entire

Chantry Commons
  A small attempt at emulating Fellchantry Square, a less grandiose open space 
among the alleys has been appropriated by locals and turned into a market.
Stalls manned by peddlers are set about the area, shouts ringing through the 
air guaranteeing quality and quantity for their patrons' hard earned coin.
From buildings on all sides, cords hang from roof to roof for the sake of 
dangling flags and other colorful decoration for this lively environment. A 
set of alleyways split off to the south and to the east, leading deeper into

Monisier Alley
  A small alleyway terminates here right off the eastern edge of the Chantry 
Commons. The far eastern wall features a single door which no doubt leads to 
someone's abode, though it is flanked by a great collection of metal artworks
which glimmer in the dim Fellchantry gloom. Frequently someone with finer 
dress would peruse the wares or speak to the artist responsible, often 
walking away with their pockets a few coins lighter. Along the northern and 
southern edges, two-storey buildings rise up and obfuscate anything beyond 
them.

Westwards lies the Chantry Commons, and one can hear the signature cries
of peddlers.

Oberon Alley
  Oberon Alley carries much of the vibrancy which one could find at the Chantry
Commons - more a road than an alley, its occupants appear to take great care 
in maintaining a respectable environment. Rumour on the lips of all who have 
bothered to set foot here speaks of the road's name, lauded after an ancient 
and obscure individual who found the secret to eternal life. It is evident in
the decorations which all doors on the eastern and western flanks have on 
them - every one a slightly different variant of the same thing: A wooden 
carving of a wolf howling at the moon.

something which one could consider quite unique for this side of the barony, 
and that is the presence of potted plants and blooming flowers.

The alley curves sharply to the west, leading towards a park.

Oberon Nook
  The alleyways eventually open up into Oberon Nook, very much resembling a 
park tucked away in a forgotten corner of the barony. The grasses which roll 
across the area are maintained with care, the sparse scattering of trees also
adding to the charm of this 'clearing' between buildings. Several benches are
featured, at least one occupied at all times while children entertain 
themselves in the open space under the supervision of the eternal gloomy sky 
overhead.

Eastwards, one may travel back to the vibrant Oberon Alley.

  The pleasantries seemingly associated with Treadway Alley continue here, some
tables and chairs scattered about the alley. Frequenters would find 
themselves here reading the new gossip prints of the week over a drink or

that if one were to look for folk with fewer scruples, a journey deeper into

Murder Alley
  A bit of a narrower path between buildings, this area does not seem to 
receive a lot of traffic. The buildings which flank the road to the north and
south are a bit more ramshackle, the air feels a bit colder, and the ground 
is a bit grimier. Upon closer inspection of the northern building, one may 
notice the trademark giving this passage its name. A splash of dark paint 
(someone dropped a bucket, no doubt) smears across the wall, the impact 
having left many spots, giving one the illusion that a throat was cut.

  The smells wafting through this alley are less charming than those elsewhere 
within the Barony, but not bad enough for one to run for the hills. Folk who 
traffic here tend to always have a bottle tucked beneath an arm, however, as 
they move from one seedy tavern to another, eyeing anyone who they may not 
recognize suspiciously. Words can be had about the general odour of unwashed 
bodies, however. The state of the surrounding buildings does not suggest 
dilapidation to the point where its denizens should look and smell the way 
they do, though the feeling of complacency hangs thick in the air.

Dead End in Bottlebreak Alley [**> PK <**]
  This particular pathway comes to an end here. The alley leads up to an 
unoccupied square with most buildings facing away from the alley itself, 
though the odd back door may be spied where servants or tenants would empty 
their chamberpots out onto the cobble underfoot. Wheels with wire along their
edges are mounted from east to west, top-floor tenants pinning and rolling 
(rare) laundry out to dry. Some of those textiles still drip beneath the 
eternal gloom of Fellchantry.

Murder Alley
  A bit of a narrower path between buildings, this area does not seem to 
receive a lot of traffic. The buildings which flank the road to the north and
south are a bit more ramshackle, the air feels a bit colder, and the ground 
is a bit grimier. Upon closer inspection of the northern building, one may 
notice the trademark giving this passage its name. A splash of dark paint 
(someone dropped a bucket, no doubt) smears across the wall, the impact 
having left many spots, giving one the illusion that a throat was cut.

Treadway Alley
  A rather open space for an alley, a multitude of tables and chairs are 
scattered around the area, serving as a quaint space for an outdoor drink or 
smoke among the regulars in this area. Some of the doors against the eastern 
buildings lead towards shops, some to homes, and others to homes with their 
back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of 
varying value. The cobblestones underfoot appear to be dark and glisten 
always, as if moistened under the toil of recent rains despite the 
ever-present overhead gloom.

allows people to cross water is one set in stone. A multitude of planks run 
from one end of the stone pavement across a narrow river from the western to

though one may spy that a few brave souls have taken it upon themselves to 
construct ramshackle balconies in order to appreciate their 'ocean view'.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.

  A tale as old as time, the denizens of Fellchantry have wondered for many 
decades - perhaps centuries - why the very structure which bridges 
Fellchantry Square and the dwelling of His Lordship, Lord Whatshisface, had 
never gotten an official name. Lo, the name of this bridge is carved into the
timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like
tree stumps and their stances that of great sentries who guard the good 
Lord's halls. Lo, they nor their impassive watch comes to a halt.

Governer's Retreat
  An odd blend of purpose is palpable when one steps into this room. It could 
be considered an opulent sitting room when the elaborate couches and 
armchairs are taken into consideration, all stacked in a comfortable 
half-circle about the hearth and centered with a polished teak coffee table, 
housing a platter with a porcelain jug and several delicate cups or fluted 
glasses. To the far eastern side, however, resting before large windows which
overlook the sprawling valleys past the barony, is a desk with delicate 
silver inlay, its amenities at this point a pressing plate for paper and a 
stoppered inkwell with a goosefeather quill resting at its side.

A Destitute Nursery
  Either this room was never used or was an afterthought when the castle was 
decorated, though its purpose remains relatively clear. Simple curtains of 
bland cottons cascade down from their railings to the floor, dragging through
the dust whenever a breeze strikes. At the center of the room rests a cradle,
and a wooden rocking chair sits unused in the northeastern corner of the 
area. The floors and walls are of simple and unadorned stone, their only 
feature being built-in cabinets with basic (and probably expired) amenities.

An Opulent Landing
  A grand attempt at appearing gentrified, sleek marbling across the polished 
floors stretch out towards heavy sets of doors to the north, south, west and 
east. The stairs terminate at a landing carpeted in bright crimson, 
eventually stretching in each of the aforementioned directions. Another set 
of marble stairs with golden railings ascends further upwards, piercing 
towards the peak of the castle where it eventually reaches a balcony 
overlooking all those who traffic here.

A Destitute Nursery
  Either this room was never used or was an afterthought when the castle was 
decorated, though its purpose remains relatively clear. Simple curtains of 
bland cottons cascade down from their railings to the floor, dragging through
the dust whenever a breeze strikes. At the center of the room rests a cradle,
and a wooden rocking chair sits unused in the northeastern corner of the 
area. The floors and walls are of simple and unadorned stone, their only 
feature being built-in cabinets with basic (and probably expired) amenities.

Governer's Retreat
  An odd blend of purpose is palpable when one steps into this room. It could 
be considered an opulent sitting room when the elaborate couches and 
armchairs are taken into consideration, all stacked in a comfortable 
half-circle about the hearth and centered with a polished teak coffee table, 
housing a platter with a porcelain jug and several delicate cups or fluted 
glasses. To the far eastern side, however, resting before large windows which
overlook the sprawling valleys past the barony, is a desk with delicate 
silver inlay, its amenities at this point a pressing plate for paper and a 
stoppered inkwell with a goosefeather quill resting at its side.

The 'damage' command allows you to change the way damage messages are 
displayed to you. You can combine all hits per round of combat and see 
either a total or the average. You can also combine hits per damage type
and view much smaller simplified damage message. 

See 'help dtrack' for how to measure your damage over time.

The full list of damage settings available is:

     0 - Regular damage output. One line per hit.
     1 - Total damage per round of combat - regular damage output.
     2 - Total damage per round of combat - basic damage output.
     3 - Average damage per round of combat - regular damage output.

     5 - Total damage per round of combat - very short basic output.
     6 - Total per round for each damage type - regular output.

Known Issues:

There are some areas in the MUD where damage settings are not fully
respected yet. Listing those here so they don't get repeatedly posted as
bugs:


* Immunity messages and complete misses don't combine.

* Charge does not combine. This is a big one for some people - the
  skill needs to be rewritten to do damage in a different order. This will
  get fixed.

* Counter strike or similar 'reflected' damage does not combine.

* Auto-damage stuff like Gaias and Test of Faith, Counter-Strike etc
  is not combined. This one will be fixed.

* Reciting a scroll with multiple attack spells will show the combined
  damage as if it were just a single spell unless damage type is 6.

* Special stuff like rainbow and prismatic spray is not combined.

A Spiralling Stairwell
  A grand set of marble stairs with golden railings twist from below, 
eventually tightening as one continues to travel upwards before reaching a 
small landing with two utterly basic potted plants flanking a set of wooden 
doors which lead towards the Baron's offices. These doors appear to be locked
at all times, the man in charge only ever peeking past a slit within one of 
the barriers before permitting entry to whomsoever bequeaths an audience with
him.

An Opulent Landing
  A grand attempt at appearing gentrified, sleek marbling across the polished

Gentleman's Lounge
  It would so appear that the stories are true surrounding the opulent 
Gentleman's Lounge, housing and playing host to the more 'gentrified' movers 
and shakers of Fellchantry's recreational activities. A grand, stained 
wooden bar arches in a crescent along the eastern wall, accompanied by 
several padded stools for patrons to seat themselves on. Scattered throughout
the room are rounded coffee tables, each flanked by expertly carved armchairs
and ice buckets holding frosted heavy liquors. The air tinges blue as it 
hangs thickly with smoke - a consolidation of wet tobacco, molasses and 
cherry.

Westwards the lounge opens further towards the rest of the castle.

Bridge Three
  A tale as old as time, the denizens of Fellchantry have wondered for many 
decades - perhaps centuries - why the very structure which bridges 
Fellchantry Square and the dwelling of His Lordship, Lord Whatshisface, had 
never gotten an official name. Lo, the name of this bridge is carved into the
timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like
tree stumps and their stances that of great sentries who guard the good 
Lord's halls. Lo, they nor their impassive watch comes to a halt.
  
Lo, how snugly their britches fit.

  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the 
closer one moves towards the hulking drawbridge which lies eastwards and is 
stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.

    The signature smell of Fellchantry (jokingly referred to as "Kettermoor

the docks to be found in that direction. The aroma, not so much unpleasant
as it is unusual, has strong fishy accents punctuated with less-identifiable
effluvia. Fishmongers exhort the crowds with carny-like shouts, each
extolling the freshness and superiority of their particular wares. The
occasional prostitute wanders through, on their way to providing the
services of Andolor's oldest profession to the dock crowd.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

Fellchantry Square
  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the 
closer one moves towards the hulking drawbridge which lies eastwards and is 
stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.
 
To the north, south and west, the Square continues to sprawl out and avail 
itself of the free (yet more dangerous) space offered here.

Fellchantry Square
  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

Brimtoil Alley
  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Further south, the alleyway eventually twists east and out of sight.

Brimtoil Alley
  Past the northern bustle one comes to the calmer, plainer and saner
environment of Fellchantry's alleyways. There are still the odd buildings 
with awkward doors upon surprisingly sturdy hinges from which men and women 
conduct their many creative business ventures, though they are sparser, the 
people here skinnier and rattier, their eyes sharper, and their weapons 
always at hand. A sharp curve eventually leads across a small bridge to the 
east, eventually plunging even deeper into the (known) underbelly of the 
barony.

Bogboil Bridge
  Some may call it a bridge, others may call it a hack, but the fact that it 
allows people to cross water is one set in stone. A multitude of planks run 
from one end of the stone pavement across a narrow river from the western to 
the eastern side. The tightly-packed buildings receive a bit of a gap here, 
though one may spy that a few brave souls have taken it upon themselves to 
construct ramshackle balconies in order to appreciate their 'ocean view'.
Eastwards, the alleyways split at an intersection and vanish beyond sight.

  A rather open space for an alley, a multitude of tables and chairs are 
scattered around the area, serving as a quaint space for an outdoor drink or 
smoke among the regulars in this area. Some of the doors against the eastern 
buildings lead towards shops, some to homes, and others to homes with their 
back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of 
varying value. The cobblestones underfoot appear to be dark and glisten 
always, as if moistened under the toil of recent rains despite the 
ever-present overhead gloom.

several padded stools for patrons to seat themselves on. Scattered throughout
the room are rounded coffee tables, each flanked by expertly carved armchairs

on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder

Magnificent Marceline
  A curio shop, Magnificent Marceline carries itself upon its reputation.
Chairs and tables dot the space, allowing patrons to have a seat while they 
peruse the weird and wonderful wares that the proprietor of the store has for
sale. Dreamcatchers hang from the ceiling, sporting feathers which may just 
barely brush the heads of taller races. At the far eastern edge of the room 
is a small counter where the owner of the shop tends to purchases, happy to 
make their customers' pockets a wee bit lighter.

Treadway Alley
  A rather open space for an alley, a multitude of tables and chairs are 
scattered around the area, serving as a quaint space for an outdoor drink or 
smoke among the regulars in this area. Some of the doors against the eastern 
buildings lead towards shops, some to homes, and others to homes with their 
back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of 
varying value. The cobblestones underfoot appear to be dark and glisten 
always, as if moistened under the toil of recent rains despite the 
ever-present overhead gloom.

The alleyway continues to the north and south, westwards lies Bogboil Bridge.

Treadway Alley
  The quaint atmosphere of Treadway Alley is tantamount here, bars and 
restaurants and coffee shop owners peddling the "best seats in the house".
The scent of freshly baked confectionary hangs thickly in the air and one may
soon discover that beyond the face-value of Fellchantry rests an entire 
community and culture unseen. Somewhat more ragged than those who settle 
closer to the centre of Fellchantry, children can be seen running and 
playing, much to the chargin of their elders who traffic the alleyway.

people here skinnier and rattier, their eyes sharper, and their weapons 
always at hand. A sharp curve eventually leads across a small bridge to the 
east, eventually plunging even deeper into the (known) underbelly of the 
barony.

Bogboil Bridge
  Some may call it a bridge, others may call it a hack, but the fact that it 
allows people to cross water is one set in stone. A multitude of planks run 
from one end of the stone pavement across a narrow river from the western to 
the eastern side. The tightly-packed buildings receive a bit of a gap here, 
though one may spy that a few brave souls have taken it upon themselves to 
construct ramshackle balconies in order to appreciate their 'ocean view'.
Eastwards, the alleyways split at an intersection and vanish beyond sight.

Commons - more a road than an alley, its occupants appear to take great care 
in maintaining a respectable environment. Rumour on the lips of all who have 
bothered to set foot here speaks of the road's name, lauded after an ancient

Murder Alley
  A bit of a narrower path between buildings, this area does not seem to 
receive a lot of traffic. The buildings which flank the road to the north and
south are a bit more ramshackle, the air feels a bit colder, and the ground 
is a bit grimier. Upon closer inspection of the northern building, one may 
notice the trademark giving this passage its name. A splash of dark paint 
(someone dropped a bucket, no doubt) smears across the wall, the impact 
having left many spots, giving one the illusion that a throat was cut.

Dead End in Bottlebreak Alley [**> PK <**]
  This particular pathway comes to an end here. The alley leads up to an 
unoccupied square with most buildings facing away from the alley itself, 
though the odd back door may be spied where servants or tenants would empty 
their chamberpots out onto the cobble underfoot. Wheels with wire along their
edges are mounted from east to west, top-floor tenants pinning and rolling 
(rare) laundry out to dry. Some of those textiles still drip beneath the 
eternal gloom of Fellchantry.

Bottlebreak Alley [**> PK <**]
  The alleyway terminates at this point very much in the same way that it does 
to the north. Most human sounds are either sniffling, coughing or someone 
losing their breakfast. The odour of rum and fish is thick in the air, most 
denizens of Bottlebreak alley mostly not bothering with commerce as opposed 
to the paths closer to Fellchantry Square. Much of the ground has eroded 
here, causing buildings to fall into disrepair and become damaged by small 
rivulets of water which seep through from the far west.

Northwards, a bend leads back to Murder Alley.

  The pleasantries seemingly associated with Treadway Alley continue here, some
tables and chairs scattered about the alley. Frequenters would find 
themselves here reading the new gossip prints of the week over a drink or 
warm beverage and a warm pastry produced from an adjecent bakery. It is clear
that if one were to look for folk with fewer scruples, a journey deeper into 
the network of alleyways may be in order.

Treadway Alley
  A rather open space for an alley, a multitude of tables and chairs are 
scattered around the area, serving as a quaint space for an outdoor drink or 
smoke among the regulars in this area. Some of the doors against the eastern 
buildings lead towards shops, some to homes, and others to homes with their 
back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of 
varying value. The cobblestones underfoot appear to be dark and glisten 
always, as if moistened under the toil of recent rains despite the 
ever-present overhead gloom.

The alleyway continues to the north and south, westwards lies Bogboil Bridge.

Bogboil Bridge
  Some may call it a bridge, others may call it a hack, but the fact that it 
allows people to cross water is one set in stone. A multitude of planks run 
from one end of the stone pavement across a narrow river from the western to 
the eastern side. The tightly-packed buildings receive a bit of a gap here, 
though one may spy that a few brave souls have taken it upon themselves to 
construct ramshackle balconies in order to appreciate their 'ocean view'.
Eastwards, the alleyways split at an intersection and vanish beyond sight.

Brimtoil Alley
  Past the northern bustle one comes to the calmer, plainer and saner
environment of Fellchantry's alleyways. There are still the odd buildings 
with awkward doors upon surprisingly sturdy hinges from which men and women 
conduct their many creative business ventures, though they are sparser, the 
people here skinnier and rattier, their eyes sharper, and their weapons 
always at hand. A sharp curve eventually leads across a small bridge to the 
east, eventually plunging even deeper into the (known) underbelly of the 
barony.

Brimtoil Alley
  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Further south, the alleyway eventually twists east and out of sight.

Fellchantry Square
  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

    The signature smell of Fellchantry (jokingly referred to as "Kettermoor
Cologne") wafts in with particular potency from the west, hinting at
the docks to be found in that direction. The aroma, not so much unpleasant
as it is unusual, has strong fishy accents punctuated with less-identifiable
effluvia. Fishmongers exhort the crowds with carny-like shouts, each
extolling the freshness and superiority of their particular wares. The
occasional prostitute wanders through, on their way to providing the
services of Andolor's oldest profession to the dock crowd.

the traffic of the usual ne'er-do-wells and cutthroats here. For the majority
of the Justiciars-- Fellchantry's city guards-- the pay just isn't good
enough to really make an effort. The occasional drunk gets roughed up, and
a murderer may even be arrested if he's a little too indiscrete, but in the
end it's just keeping up appearances. Who cares about a murder when no one
misses the deceased? Besides, everyone in Fellchantry is guilty of something.

  Justice waits to the north, longing for someone to avenge the slander done
to her name. The square looms predatorily to the east and south.

  A large dais at the westernmost end of a long walkway is the most prominent
feature of His Majesty's Court of Justice. On it is a simple judge's bench,
its face decorated with the Baron's coat of arms. Those wondering about the
Baron's views on justice can find their questions answered by the large
painting that totally dominates the wall behind the bench. Simply titled,
"Justice," it depicts a woman with a radiant halo and pure white vestments
holding a sword aloft with one elegantly-sandled foot atop a pile of corpses.
It's not exactly the sort of court at whose mercy one throws oneself.
Non-descript hardwood benches are arranged in two aisles so that the
populace may observe the proceedings of the court, though few ever do.

  The way back east leads to the Justiciar Headquarters, and to the bustling

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

Baron's Beerhouse
  A lofty corner, the great bar of the Baron's Beerhouse runs in a large L 
across the northern and eastern wall, eventually terminating in a small door 
which swings this way and that as bartenders move their way in and out to 
serve the establishment's patrons. Many of the more relaxed, or perhaps 
careless, folk sit here with their backs to the door at the bar's edge, 
jokingly referred to as the "maintenance team" for keeping the taps flowing 
and the kegs empty as payment. Laughter rolls through the air of the 
beerhouse, almost as if trapped in permanent festivity.

  Perhaps the busiest corner of the beerhouse, this area has a seating 
arrangement in the form of booths which line the eastern and southern edges 
of the area. A preferred space, no doubt, as these seats appear to be 
permanently occupied by those who would use line of sight to the western 
doors to their advantage. Some call it anxiety, yet others may suggest that 
it is mere precaution given the nature of work conducted in the Barony.

Baron's Beerhouse
    Lauded as the place to be in Fellchantry, the ironically named "Baron's 
Beerhouse" (most likely never visited by the Baron himself, if rumor is to be
believed) houses a massive selection of tables, chairs, sounds, smells and 
people. The walls are adorned with basic decor and sconces which have long 
since been coated by wax from dripping candles, then coated again and never
cleaned. Smoke hangs in the air as thick as the noise generated by the 
milling of bodies and full-bellied laughter.

To the west, double-doors lead back out into the square.

several padded stools for patrons to seat themselves on. Scattered throughout
the room are rounded coffee tables, each flanked by expertly carved armchairs
and ice buckets holding frosted heavy liquors. The air tinges blue as it

Stretching a good twenty or thirty feet from the west to the east, the room

Fellchantry Square
  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and

Brimtoil Alley
  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Further south, the alleyway eventually twists east and out of sight.

that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,

Treadway Alley
  A rather open space for an alley, a multitude of tables and chairs are 
scattered around the area, serving as a quaint space for an outdoor drink or 
smoke among the regulars in this area. Some of the doors against the eastern 
buildings lead towards shops, some to homes, and others to homes with their 
back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of 
varying value. The cobblestones underfoot appear to be dark and glisten

Commons - more a road than an alley, its occupants appear to take great care 
in maintaining a respectable environment. Rumour on the lips of all who have

the traffic of the usual ne'er-do-wells and cutthroats here. For the majority
of the Justiciars-- Fellchantry's city guards-- the pay just isn't good
enough to really make an effort. The occasional drunk gets roughed up, and
a murderer may even be arrested if he's a little too indiscrete, but in the
end it's just keeping up appearances. Who cares about a murder when no one
misses the deceased? Besides, everyone in Fellchantry is guilty of something.

  Justice waits to the north, longing for someone to avenge the slander done
to her name. The square looms predatorily to the east and south.

The Bridge Over Kettermoor Crick
    The rushing waters of Kettermoor Crick flow far below this sturdy stone
bridge. In the miserable old days, the people that first settled this
godsforsaken scar of land built the bridge to access Fellchantry-- the squat,
sprawling island that sits astride the river like the biggest bully in the
schoolyard. Or so they say anyway... Really, it'd make just as much sense if
they built the bridge to give themselves something high enough to jump from.
Fellchantry isn't what you'd call a vacation spot. The water is colder
and darker than a witch's heart. The fog-- like a mourner's veil-- stretches
perpetually over the land, as if the sun just can't eat a big enough
breakfast to ever cook it off. This is where dreams go to die.

  To the west the Crickbridge Road leads away from town. To the east the city
of Fellchantry looms, looking like the saddest verse of the most dismal dirge
you've ever heard. If the word on the street is true, then the murdered smith
is somewhere inside, his body giving off the putrescent stench of a mystery.

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.
  
  The front door leads north back to the square, but who could leave when
their heart's most cherished treasure is bound to be on the next shelf they
see? Stay a while... Stay a while...

Fellchantry Square
  The southwestern portion of Fellchantry Square is most notable for being
the location of the city's shopping district, such as it is. Small
mercantile shops abound, each with signs boasting their wares. The largest
of the shops, the general store, boasts a sign reading: "Needful Things
For Sale or Trade." From the flow of traffic in and out of the shop, its
Things must be very Needful indeed.

  To the south marvelous things are for sale. To the north and east
the square offers other amusements.

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

La Rochelle Row
  A welcome break from the square, buildings of stone and layered over with 
plaster cascade in varying shapes and forms towards the south. Beddings and 
pots provide a surprisingly lush fauna in reflection to the denizens which 
march these cobblestone ways - lords and ladies by any given right, all 
marred with some deformation or another which tells of their past during (or 
perhaps prior to) their stay within Fellchantry. Surely the Barony had seen 
no opulence like this since Valkur himself had fallen.
 
To one's north they would find their gaze fixated upon the many bodies which 
traffic Fellchantry Square, while southwards the opulence continues. Many 
structures present the grace and presence of emulated royalty, though some 
find themselves distinguished from others via eye-catching entrances and bold
gatherings before their respective halls.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

Fellchantry Square
  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the 
closer one moves towards the hulking drawbridge which lies eastwards and is 
stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.

itself of the free (yet more dangerous) space offered here.

Bridge Three
  A tale as old as time, the denizens of Fellchantry have wondered for many 
decades - perhaps centuries - why the very structure which bridges 
Fellchantry Square and the dwelling of His Lordship, Lord Whatshisface, had 
never gotten an official name. Lo, the name of this bridge is carved into the
timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like
tree stumps and their stances that of great sentries who guard the good 
Lord's halls. Lo, they nor their impassive watch comes to a halt.
  
Lo, how snugly their britches fit.

Elroy Castle Entrance Hall
  How grand an entrance hall you find yourself within - serving wenches in nary
a linen and fine gentlemen wearing but scraps of silk - one would find 
themselves hard-pressed to be within such luxury if not for the subtle signs 
of cracks within the walls and ominous copper-like stains within the ceiling.
Alas, the marbled floors are home to great statues of even more marble and 
cheaper materials, no doubt having been harvested from proprietors who also 
produced the tasteless glass-shrouded chandeliers overhead.

  In this particular room, the cold stone walls are paneled with dark and 
polished wooden slats of some arcane kind. Silken sheets find themselves 
draped from the edges of the room to cover the ceiling, tying in a knot at 
the center of the area. One could consider this a bedroom of sorts, as a 
veiled bed rests with its headrest against one wall, though a fainting couch 
and other seating arrangements have been assembled around a hearth against 
the eastern side of the room. South leads towards a small balcony - easily 
considered to be a waste of resources considering its insignificant size -

Lady's Fainting Chamber (G)
  In this particular room, the cold stone walls are paneled with dark and 
polished wooden slats of some arcane kind. Silken sheets find themselves 
draped from the edges of the room to cover the ceiling, tying in a knot at 
the center of the area. One could consider this a bedroom of sorts, as a 
veiled bed rests with its headrest against one wall, though a fainting couch 
and other seating arrangements have been assembled around a hearth against 
the eastern side of the room. South leads towards a small balcony - easily 
considered to be a waste of resources considering its insignificant size - 
overlooking the more 'reputable' part of Fellchantry, if one would believe 
such a thing exists.

Governer's Retreat
  An odd blend of purpose is palpable when one steps into this room. It could 
be considered an opulent sitting room when the elaborate couches and 
armchairs are taken into consideration, all stacked in a comfortable 
half-circle about the hearth and centered with a polished teak coffee table, 
housing a platter with a porcelain jug and several delicate cups or fluted 
glasses. To the far eastern side, however, resting before large windows which
overlook the sprawling valleys past the barony, is a desk with delicate 
silver inlay, its amenities at this point a pressing plate for paper and a 
stoppered inkwell with a goosefeather quill resting at its side.

  Either this room was never used or was an afterthought when the castle was

bland cottons cascade down from their railings to the floor, dragging through

and a wooden rocking chair sits unused in the northeastern corner of the

Elroy Castle Entrance Hall
  How grand an entrance hall you find yourself within - serving wenches in nary
a linen and fine gentlemen wearing but scraps of silk - one would find 
themselves hard-pressed to be within such luxury if not for the subtle signs 
of cracks within the walls and ominous copper-like stains within the ceiling.
Alas, the marbled floors are home to great statues of even more marble and 
cheaper materials, no doubt having been harvested from proprietors who also 
produced the tasteless glass-shrouded chandeliers overhead.

for carriageboys rests a grand manor upon evidently rich soil, its gardens

The Guild
  The working class of Fellchantry: the Guild is a simple stone building which 
one may mistake for a tavern or bar at a glance. Tables and chairs are 
littered across the area in no particular pattern. At the far western edge of
the room is a long, wide bar, the wall behind it lined with wooden shelves 
housing a large selection of liquors with no label or indication of what it 
may be, though whatever barkeep may be servicing the organization's members 
seems to know exactly what lies where, what goes into what, and which 
concoction to conjure. Upon the northern and southern walls are a scattering 
of mis-matched decor. Right next to a large tapestry is a taxidermied boar's 
head, or an emblem with crossed swords embossed upon a wooden panel would 
hang askew, teetering on the edge of harpooning the skull of whoever may find 
themselves beneath it should it eventually decide to fall.

La Rochelle Row
  A conglomerate of buildings continue to sprawl their way southwards and 
eventually come to an end at an awakward cul de sac, though the brilliant 
white of cobble beneath an eternal gloomy sky have yet to lose their luster 
within the Barony. Yonder west lies perhaps the most inconspicuous building 
of the lot - enough so that one may not place words to it lest they venture 
beyond their vocabulary. Eastwards, however, among the cries of "Ho, lad!" 
for carriageboys rests a grand manor upon evidently rich soil, its gardens 
immaculate and lacking no maintenance. 
 
Northwards La Rochelle Row continues before eventually terminating within
the infamous Fellchantry Square, where a particular entanglement of scents
may remind the denizens of this lovely place of "home".

La Rochelle Row
  A welcome break from the square, buildings of stone and layered over with 
plaster cascade in varying shapes and forms towards the south. Beddings and 
pots provide a surprisingly lush fauna in reflection to the denizens which 
march these cobblestone ways - lords and ladies by any given right, all 
marred with some deformation or another which tells of their past during (or 
perhaps prior to) their stay within Fellchantry. Surely the Barony had seen 
no opulence like this since Valkur himself had fallen.
 
To one's north they would find their gaze fixated upon the many bodies which 
traffic Fellchantry Square, while southwards the opulence continues. Many 
structures present the grace and presence of emulated royalty, though some 
find themselves distinguished from others via eye-catching entrances and bold
gatherings before their respective halls.

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

  In this particular room, the cold stone walls are paneled with dark and 
polished wooden slats of some arcane kind. Silken sheets find themselves 
draped from the edges of the room to cover the ceiling, tying in a knot at 
the center of the area. One could consider this a bedroom of sorts, as a 
veiled bed rests with its headrest against one wall, though a fainting couch 
and other seating arrangements have been assembled around a hearth against 
the eastern side of the room. South leads towards a small balcony - easily 
considered to be a waste of resources considering its insignificant size - 
overlooking the more 'reputable' part of Fellchantry, if one would believe 
such a thing exists.

A Destitute Nursery
  Either this room was never used or was an afterthought when the castle was 
decorated, though its purpose remains relatively clear. Simple curtains of 
bland cottons cascade down from their railings to the floor, dragging through
the dust whenever a breeze strikes. At the center of the room rests a cradle,
and a wooden rocking chair sits unused in the northeastern corner of the 
area. The floors and walls are of simple and unadorned stone, their only 
feature being built-in cabinets with basic (and probably expired) amenities.

"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the

exam lady
This woman has... Big hair. In fact, it appears to be at least twice the size
of her head. Her face is stark white with the layers upon layers of makeup 
that have been applied, and about her form is a dress of exquisite finery,
finally held in place by an outer corset, narrowing her waist by no doubt at 
least half its size. She seems somewhat bewildered, though one may assume 
this is her permanent state.
Lady Kormack is in perfect health.

  Either this room was never used or was an afterthought when the castle was 
decorated, though its purpose remains relatively clear. Simple curtains of 
bland cottons cascade down from their railings to the floor, dragging through
the dust whenever a breeze strikes. At the center of the room rests a cradle,
and a wooden rocking chair sits unused in the northeastern corner of the 
area. The floors and walls are of simple and unadorned stone, their only 
feature being built-in cabinets with basic (and probably expired) amenities.

  Red carpet obfuscates the sound of footsteps, providing the area with
utter silence. Motes of dust sparkle in the light which streams in from the 
large, glass-inlaid balcony doors to the west, no doubt cast off from the 
small (though supposedly great, by the barony's standards) shelves which line
every other wall of the room, housing ledgers, tomes and volumes of many

Fellchantry Square
  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the 
closer one moves towards the hulking drawbridge which lies eastwards and is 
stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.
 
To the north, south and west, the Square continues to sprawl out and avail 
itself of the free (yet more dangerous) space offered here.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the

This is the body of what appears to be a fairly young man, some time past the
cusp of manhood and well approaching perhaps his thirties. Closer inspection 
of the corpse reveals bruises on his arms and legs, as well as a dark, dusty 
material beneath his fingernails, suggesting that he was part of a struggle.
The presence of a sheath at his side, though the lack of a knife, means he 
may well have been disarmed. Multiple lacerations are present across his 
palms, shoulders and upper arms, though it appears that the fatality was 
caused by a stab wound in the chest.

back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of

Chantry Commons
  A small attempt at emulating Fellchantry Square, a less grandiose open space 
among the alleys has been appropriated by locals and turned into a market.
Stalls manned by peddlers are set about the area, shouts ringing through the 
air guaranteeing quality and quantity for their patrons' hard earned coin.
From buildings on all sides, cords hang from roof to roof for the sake of 
dangling flags and other colorful decoration for this lively environment. A 
set of alleyways split off to the south and to the east, leading deeper into 
Fellchantry's underbelly network.

Oberon Alley
  Oberon Alley carries much of the vibrancy which one could find at the Chantry
Commons - more a road than an alley, its occupants appear to take great care 
in maintaining a respectable environment. Rumour on the lips of all who have 
bothered to set foot here speaks of the road's name, lauded after an ancient 
and obscure individual who found the secret to eternal life. It is evident in
the decorations which all doors on the eastern and western flanks have on 
them - every one a slightly different variant of the same thing: A wooden 
carving of a wolf howling at the moon.

Oberon Alley
  Flags of bright color are draped wherever the occupants of this area could 
find a spot, the vibrant atmosphere continuing even this far south of the 
Chantry Commons. Here one can still see a multitude of howling wolf carvings 
draped above neighbourhood doors. Some of the tightly packed houses feature 
something which one could consider quite unique for this side of the barony, 
and that is the presence of potted plants and blooming flowers.

The alley curves sharply to the west, leading towards a park.

Oberon Nook
  The alleyways eventually open up into Oberon Nook, very much resembling a 
park tucked away in a forgotten corner of the barony. The grasses which roll 
across the area are maintained with care, the sparse scattering of trees also
adding to the charm of this 'clearing' between buildings. Several benches are
featured, at least one occupied at all times while children entertain 
themselves in the open space under the supervision of the eternal gloomy sky 
overhead.

Eastwards, one may travel back to the vibrant Oberon Alley.

Commons. The far eastern wall features a single door which no doubt leads to 
someone's abode, though it is flanked by a great collection of metal artworks
which glimmer in the dim Fellchantry gloom. Frequently someone with finer 
dress would peruse the wares or speak to the artist responsible, often 
walking away with their pockets a few coins lighter. Along the northern and 
southern edges, two-storey buildings rise up and obfuscate anything beyond 
them.

Westwards lies the Chantry Commons, and one can hear the signature cries

The scent of freshly baked confectionary hangs thickly in the air and one may
soon discover that beyond the face-value of Fellchantry rests an entire 
community and culture unseen. Somewhat more ragged than those who settle 
closer to the centre of Fellchantry, children can be seen running and 
playing, much to the chargin of their elders who traffic the alleyway.

is a bit grimier. Upon closer inspection of the northern building, one may 
notice the trademark giving this passage its name. A splash of dark paint

with awkward doors upon surprisingly sturdy hinges from which men and women 
conduct their many creative business ventures, though they are sparser, the

populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

La Rochelle Row
  A welcome break from the square, buildings of stone and layered over with 
plaster cascade in varying shapes and forms towards the south. Beddings and 
pots provide a surprisingly lush fauna in reflection to the denizens which 
march these cobblestone ways - lords and ladies by any given right, all 
marred with some deformation or another which tells of their past during (or 
perhaps prior to) their stay within Fellchantry. Surely the Barony had seen 
no opulence like this since Valkur himself had fallen.
 
To one's north they would find their gaze fixated upon the many bodies which 
traffic Fellchantry Square, while southwards the opulence continues. Many 
structures present the grace and presence of emulated royalty, though some 
find themselves distinguished from others via eye-catching entrances and bold
gatherings before their respective halls.

along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and

  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

timbers as well as the burly men who stand watch upon it; their arms are like

Fellchantry Square
  The southwestern portion of Fellchantry Square is most notable for being
the location of the city's shopping district, such as it is. Small
mercantile shops abound, each with signs boasting their wares. The largest
of the shops, the general store, boasts a sign reading: "Needful Things
For Sale or Trade." From the flow of traffic in and out of the shop, its
Things must be very Needful indeed.

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.
  
  The front door leads north back to the square, but who could leave when
their heart's most cherished treasure is bound to be on the next shelf they
see? Stay a while... Stay a while...

Fellchantry Square
  The southwestern portion of Fellchantry Square is most notable for being
the location of the city's shopping district, such as it is. Small
mercantile shops abound, each with signs boasting their wares. The largest
of the shops, the general store, boasts a sign reading: "Needful Things
For Sale or Trade." From the flow of traffic in and out of the shop, its
Things must be very Needful indeed.

  To the south marvelous things are for sale. To the north and east
the square offers other amusements.

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

Fellchantry Square [**> PK <**]
    The signature smell of Fellchantry (jokingly referred to as "Kettermoor
Cologne") wafts in with particular potency from the west, hinting at
the docks to be found in that direction. The aroma, not so much unpleasant
as it is unusual, has strong fishy accents punctuated with less-identifiable
effluvia. Fishmongers exhort the crowds with carny-like shouts, each
extolling the freshness and superiority of their particular wares. The
occasional prostitute wanders through, on their way to providing the
services of Andolor's oldest profession to the dock crowd.
 
  Fellchantry's docks lie to the west, offering an escape from the square.
Farther east an unusually lively building boasts signs claiming the coldest

Fellchantry Square
  The presence of the barony's courthouse to the north does nothing to curb
the traffic of the usual ne'er-do-wells and cutthroats here. For the majority
of the Justiciars-- Fellchantry's city guards-- the pay just isn't good
enough to really make an effort. The occasional drunk gets roughed up, and
a murderer may even be arrested if he's a little too indiscrete, but in the
end it's just keeping up appearances. Who cares about a murder when no one
misses the deceased? Besides, everyone in Fellchantry is guilty of something.

  Justice waits to the north, longing for someone to avenge the slander done
to her name. The square looms predatorily to the east and south.

Justiciar Headquarters
  This aged building, remarkable only in that it's slightly less run down than
the structures around it, is home to His Majesty's Justiciars. From here
Fellchantry's city guards work hard at the appearance of upholding justice.
In reality the guards are only about two steps removed from being criminals
themselves, and the sour reek of tobacco, alcohol, and sweat on the air says
much about the Justiciars' efficacy. Still, the Baron's coat of arms hangs
large on the wall, and that's all the legitimacy these men need.

  His Majesty's Kangaroo Court is in the western wing of the courthouse. To
the south wait the pickpockets and cutpurses of Fellchantry Square.

very expensive cost and, for most players, not worth it. 

*** Please note that all upgrades need to be submitted to the Imms on
the upgrades board.

* No mobs may reset in combat maze rooms; the resets must be moved to a
different room (read mu-mobs for pricing). The room will also be flagged no-summon.
 
** Indoors sectors are inside by default, outdoors sectors are outside by
default. If you're unsure if a sector is indoors/outdoors, ask.  No air sector.
 
*** Maximum heal/mana rates in manor rooms is 200%.
 
**** The first room name and description are free to the purchasing player.
Foreign language is allowed in manor room descriptions.

** Room Desc Limit - It is possible to add more than 40 lines but very 
expensive - 150qp and 5m gold per line. This option only exists because it 
was *really* important to some people so it is here if you want it at a 
very expensive cost and, for most players, not worth it. 

*** Please note that all upgrades need to be submitted to the Imms on
the upgrades board.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:  color        - toggles current setting.
         color on/off - explicitly set color to on or off.

The 'color' command turns on/off MUD output coloring.  'ansi' is an alias
for 'color'.

The ANSI standard allows for 15 common colors that appear everywhere in
Aardwolf.  They are divided into normal and bright colors.

   @b / @B blue / bblue           @c / @C cyan / bcyan
   @r / @R red / bred             @m / @M magenta / bmagenta
   @g / @G green / bgreen         @w / @W white / bwhite
   @y / @Y yellow / byellow            @D gray (bright black)

Grey/bright black is not visible on all connections; use the 'seegray'
toggle to enable/disable seeing bright black.  There is no 'dark black'.

To use color codes in your title, communication, or whatever else you
write, prefix the color with '@' followed by the letter code.

For example, '@WColor @Gis @mCool.@w' will look like
              Color is Cool.               

It may help to END A SEGMENT OF COLORED TEXT WITH @w.  This changes 
the color of the text to low white.

To display an @ symbol, use @@.  @- may be used to display a tilde, though
the MUD no longer processes them and thus the standard tilde may be used.

Aardwolf allows you to customize your own independent color scheme for most
types of MUD output.  Type 'help colorset' to read about this feature.  The
syntax 'colorset colors' will display all 15 colors and their color codes
similar to the list above.

Aardwolf also supports xterm 256 color mode- see 'help xterm' for more
information.

Channels (discluding tells and echos) may have their color scheme returned 
to the channel's default color for all users after a color change has been 
displayed. To do this, simply use $C at the point where you would like to 
resume the channel's regular color. Note that it is difficult to actually 
display $C itself on a channel, e.g., for MUSHclient or CMUD a user can 
type $@ C. Also note that $C does not work in the note editor.

help xterm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Xterm.

Syntax     : xterm              - Turn 256 color mode on/off.
             color 256          - See a table of the colors.
             color raw256       - See table of colors with no mud parsing.

Aardwolf now supports Xterm 256 color mode. Whether or not you can see 
Xterm 256 color depends on your client. See the bottom of this helpfile 
for a brief list of clients known to work with 256 colors.

Every xterm color has a corresponding "closest match" in ANSI so that
players without xterm support are not affected.

To use xterm colors use @x[color] where [color] is any number 0 - 255. 
The first 16 colors corresponding to their ANSI equivalents and colors 232 
to 255 are varying levels of gray. An online chart of all 256 colors can
be found at:

 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Xterm_color_chart.png

It is possible to use either @x020 or @x20 but the 3 character version 
is recommended to avoid conflicts with color codes followed by numbers 
that are part of the actual message.

All codes from 0 to 255 can be used with @x but some colors considered 
too dark to display on the average screen will be automatically 
brightened. To see this, compare 'color 256' to 'color raw256' noting 
the difference (for example) in colors 0, 52, 53 and 232. 


Clients:
--------

Clients known to work with 256 color include Mushclient, Mudlet, CMud 3.x, 
Tintin++, Tinyfugue, Atlantis and the Blowtorch Android clients. Note that
Zmud does not work with Xterm 256 colors. To see if you have 256 color
support, type 'xterm', if you see Orange then you have it. 


Known Issues:
-------------

- Kind of obscure, but if you have GMCP rawcolor mode on but do NOT have
  xterm, the GMCP data is still going to show @x123. There is an overhead
  involved in fixing this that may make it not worth it. If you're using
  rawcolors via GMCP then you have a means to process color locally even
  if you can't actually display 256 colors.

- Whoname cannot currently use 256 color mode.

- You can use these colors in strings in the editor (object names etc)
  but not in editor fields specifically requiring a color name such as
  the default map color for an area or in sector editing.

Room name: Before a Castle of Spiders
-- Room Desc Begin --
As you step into this section of the forest, you notice a continuous line of 
spiders all moving on the same path. It seems very odd... 

Looking in the direction of the path, you notice a road that leads to a 
clearing in the forest. 

In the clearing is a large castle. Examining the shape of the castle, you 
notice the pinnacles of the towers almost seem like... sharp ends of spider 
legs. Now that you think of it, the entire castle seems as if it was made to be 
shaped like an enormous spider buried in the ground. It must be at least 100ft 
tall.
