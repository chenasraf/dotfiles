Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
CLAN: At-ten-tion! KumoGami is here to get some training done!
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: east (down) ]
     (Magic) A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     (Magic) Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.

The Gunfire and Training cease for a moment as the Boot Hall is Restored.

You wake up on Medical beds, then stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: east (down) ]
     (Magic) A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     (Magic) Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.
     (Magic) An old electric heater.
(Player) (Golden Aura) (White Aura) (OPK) Inix the Hunter is sleeping in a trivia sleeping bag.
[AFK] (Player) (Golden Aura) Roume wasn't built in a day. is sleeping on Medical beds.
[AFK] (Player) (Golden Aura) Davem returning mudder from years ago is sleeping on Medical beds.
(Player) (Invis) (Hidden) (Translucent) (Golden Aura) (White Aura) Drimshade the Navigator.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A Short Hallway
  The hallway is rather quiet, without a soul to be seen here.  It's large
enough that three people can walk through it abreast, a torch sconce on the
walls every ten feet or so.  It's more plain than the lobby, the wooden
walls unpainted.  A thin dirt-brown carpet does line the floor in
consideration of weary, aching feet.

The Training Field
  The training field is huge, covering several acres.  This was, perhaps,
optimism on the part of the first Guildmembers who built the base.  The air
is filled with pegasi, dragons, and their human counterparts, perfecting the

The Training Field
  The training field is huge, covering several acres.  This was, perhaps,
optimism on the part of the first Guildmembers who built the base.  The air
is filled with pegasi, dragons, and their human counterparts, perfecting the
skills they're going to need in the upcoming war.  The ground has long since
been packed hard from centuries of traffic by hooves and feet, and the only

built into tunnels in the semi-surrounding mountain.

Aidan and Xamiku's Lair
  Aidan has always preferred comfortable surroundings, and he sees no
reason to lead an austere life here in the Crag.  While he's still left
plenty of room for Xamiku to move around, the lair is filled with
comfortable furniture, and even a fireplace has been installed.  Aidan does
all of his own cooking as well, and is rather proud of his gourmet
abilities.  (Taryl cooked for him once.  They have agreed that this is not
in the best interests of anybody's health.)

Aliana and Islien's Lair
  Aliana and Islien have just recently taken up residence in a lair of
their own, and they've been students for so long that they have only a few
belongings of their own.  The lair is achingly empty of decoration except
for the curtain stretched across the mouth of the cavern.  It's doubtful
that Aliana has really taken much notice of that fact, though- the only
thing important in her eyes is her beloved partner.  Everything else could
disappear and she'd never notice.  

<MAPEND>
[ Exits: west ]
(Golden Aura) Islien stretches out to make sure Aliana can reach every scale on her body.
(Golden Aura) Aliana lovingly brushes her partner's hide until it gleams in the torchlight.

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step

with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to

the warm sunlight into splendorous rainbow patterns.

You feel an urge of carefree joy, and long to dance and frolick
in this wonderland. A large oak tree provides plenty of shade, ripe
apples blanketing the ground under it.

To the north, you see a big mountain made of rock candy.

Maple Lane
  The lane is interrupted here by a huge maple tree. Passing to the south of it, 
you see the lane splits into Forest View Drive, and to the north of it, 
Forest Hill Circle. These roads are well marked by neatly painted road signs,
hammered to the maple tree. The whole appearance is that of a busy traffic 
circle around a great monument, but there is no real traffic here - with the 
exception of the occasional fox and rabbit.

  On either side of Maple Lane, the forest looms. It is almost like a jungle,

A trail though the ferns...
  
A path leads off through the ferns to the north of Maple Lane, the soft 
green fronds gently brushing against your legs as you traverse the rough
trail. The fresh aroma of the forest invites you to breath deeply, the 
scents of the vegetation a delight to your senses. The high pitched 
chirping of cicadas sound in the distance and the occasional bright blue
ulysses butterfly flits and flutters over the giant fern fronds. A deep 
black shadow mirrors you as you head north, deliberately rustling the 
foliage to attract your attention. You know you have gone too far north 
when the shadow, in the form of a large black cat, leaps out from the 
ferns and blocks your way forward.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Colors Colours Ansi.
Help Category : Features.
Related Helps : Colorset, Rawcolors, Xterm.
Last Updated  : 2021-12-19 11:02:34.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:  color        - toggles current setting.
         color on/off - explicitly set color to on or off.

The 'color' command turns on/off MUD output coloring.  'ansi' is an alias
for 'color'.

The ANSI standard allows for 15 common colors that appear everywhere in
Aardwolf.  They are divided into normal and bright colors.

   @b / @B blue / bblue           @c / @C cyan / bcyan
   @r / @R red / bred             @m / @M magenta / bmagenta
   @g / @G green / bgreen         @w / @W white / bwhite
   @y / @Y yellow / byellow            @D gray (bright black)

Grey/bright black is not visible on all connections; use the 'seegray'
toggle to enable/disable seeing bright black.  There is no 'dark black'.

To use color codes in your title, communication, or whatever else you
write, prefix the color with '@' followed by the letter code.

For example, '@WColor @Gis @mCool.@w' will look like
              Color is Cool.               

It may help to END A SEGMENT OF COLORED TEXT WITH @w.  This changes 
the color of the text to low white.

To display an @ symbol, use @@.  @- may be used to display a tilde, though
the MUD no longer processes them and thus the standard tilde may be used.

Aardwolf allows you to customize your own independent color scheme for most
types of MUD output.  Type 'help colorset' to read about this feature.  The
syntax 'colorset colors' will display all 15 colors and their color codes
similar to the list above.

Aardwolf also supports xterm 256 color mode- see 'help xterm' for more
information.

Channels (discluding tells and echos) may have their color scheme returned 
to the channel's default color for all users after a color change has been 
displayed. To do this, simply use $C at the point where you would like to 
resume the channel's regular color. Note that it is difficult to actually 
display $C itself on a channel, e.g., for MUSHclient or CMUD a user can 
type $@ C. Also note that $C does not work in the note editor.

This note has been made by the Manor Generator.
**Upgrade Number 1 (Change Name/Desc (MU-Room #12)):**
 
Change room name/desc of manorwoods-701.
 
Room name: Before a Castle of Spiders
-- Room Desc Begin --
As you step into this section of the forest, you notice a continuous line of 
spiders all moving on the same path. It seems very odd... 
@w
Looking in the direction of the path, you notice a road that leads to a 
clearing in the forest. 
@w
In the clearing is a large castle. Examining the shape of the castle, you 
notice the pinnacles of the towers almost seem like... sharp ends of spider 
legs. Now that you think of it, the entire castle seems as if it was made to be
shaped like an enormous spider buried in the ground. It must be at least 100ft 
tall. In the front of the castle, you see a cat guarding the entrance.

As you step into this section of the forest, you notice a continuous line of 
spiders all moving on the same path. It seems very odd... 
@w
Looking in the direction of the path, you notice a road that leads to a 
clearing in the forest. 
@w
In the clearing is a large castle. Examining the shape of the castle, you 
notice the pinnacles of the towers almost seem like... sharp ends of spider 
legs. Now that you think of it, the entire castle seems as if it was made to be
shaped like an enormous spider buried in the ground. It must be at least 100ft 
tall. In the front of the castle, you see a cat guarding the entrance.

As you step into this section of the forest, you notice a continuous line of 
spiders all moving on the same path. It seems very odd... 
@w
Looking in the direction of the path, you notice a road that leads to a 
clearing in the forest. 
@w
In the clearing is a large castle. Examining the shape of the castle, you 
notice the pinnacles of the towers almost seem like... sharp ends of spider 
legs. Now that you think of it, the entire castle seems as if it was made to be
shaped like an enormous spider buried in the ground. It must be at least 100ft 
tall. In the front of the castle, you see a cat guarding the entrance.

Change room name/desc of manorwoods-701.
 
Room name: Before a Castle of Spiders
-- Room Desc Begin --
As you step into this section of the forest, you notice a continuous line of
spiders all moving on the same path. It seems very odd... 

Looking in the direction of the path, you notice a road that leads to a
clearing in the forest. 

In the clearing is a large castle. Examining the shape of the castle, you
notice the pinnacles of the towers almost seem like... sharp ends of spider
legs. Now that you think of it, the entire castle seems as if it was made to be
shaped like an enormous spider buried in the ground. It must be at least 100ft
tall. In the front of the castle, you see a cat guarding the entrance.

| Hello, Imms of Aardwolf :)
| 
| I would like to purchase a manor in manorwoods.
| I understand this will cost me 60 TP, and I have them on my character,
| ready to be exchanged.
| 
| The speedrun to the outside room, from the area entrance is:
| 
| run 2se3se3se4s2e4n
| 
| I would like the manor porch to be located to the east of that room.
|

Mesolar's melting pot of debauchery. One may merely cross the Kettermoor to

On the Crickbridge Road
  It was a dark and stormy night...

  There's a saying out in the darker parts of the country that, for a man
in the right kinds of trouble, all roads lead to Fellchantry. They say that
when "No Fear" Narlfryd, the famed Wolfen daredevil, needed a place to lay
low, he came to Fellchantry and knifed a guy over a card game. The story
goes that he wanted to use a vacation in a cell as a chance to let a bad
storm blow over. The authorities didn't give him the chance. They took one
look at that body, shook their heads, and walked the other way. Fellchantry
is just that kind of place. Around here, they're ALL dark and stormy nights,
and the residents like it that way just fine.

  To the east lies the bridge over Kettermoor Crick, the deceptively named
fast-running river that supplies Fellchantry with its ne'erending supply of
fish, trade taxes, and surly attitudes.

The Bridge Over Kettermoor Crick
    The rushing waters of Kettermoor Crick flow far below this sturdy stone
bridge. In the miserable old days, the people that first settled this
godsforsaken scar of land built the bridge to access Fellchantry-- the squat,
sprawling island that sits astride the river like the biggest bully in the
schoolyard. Or so they say anyway... Really, it'd make just as much sense if
they built the bridge to give themselves something high enough to jump from.
Fellchantry isn't what you'd call a vacation spot. The water is colder
and darker than a witch's heart. The fog-- like a mourner's veil-- stretches
perpetually over the land, as if the sun just can't eat a big enough
breakfast to ever cook it off. This is where dreams go to die.

  To the west the Crickbridge Road leads away from town. To the east the city
of Fellchantry looms, looking like the saddest verse of the most dismal dirge
you've ever heard. If the word on the street is true, then the murdered smith
is somewhere inside, his body giving off the putrescent stench of a mystery.

Fellchantry Square
  Here, filled with all manner of sights and smells, is Fellchantry Square.
In the constant hell of the Barony, this is where the honest (and you have
to be flexible on your definition here) citizens come to gossip, barter, and
conduct their necessary business. The square is a microcosm of the city; all
cramped buildings, bustling crowds, and narrow side streets. A guy could get
lost with the slightest wandering from the beaten path, and he probably
wouldn't like where he ended up. The only thing less welcoming than
Fellchantry's main streets are its back alleys.
 
  The spikes of the raised Kettermoor gate loom to the west like a dragon
waiting for a snack. From all other directions the cramped chaos of the

The General Store
  What purports to be a simple general store on the outside is somehow so
much more on the inside... The shop's proprietor prides himself on having
something for everyone, and to that end the shop is a mess of shelves and
racks, each holding its own little universe of odds and ends. The General
Store is the sort of place where one enters and seems to find the very
thing they were just wishing they had. The deep shadows lining the far
corners of the shop, and the way the hushed whispers of customers suddenly
cease when anyone gets too close, are enough to show most just how sinister
the desires of the clientele can be. In Fellchantry everything is for sale,
and affording the price isn't always a matter of money.
  
  The front door leads north back to the square, but who could leave when
their heart's most cherished treasure is bound to be on the next shelf they

  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?

of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of

that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

Fellchantry Square
  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

Brimtoil Alley
  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Further south, the alleyway eventually twists east and out of sight.

Brimtoil Alley
  Past the northern bustle one comes to the calmer, plainer and saner
environment of Fellchantry's alleyways. There are still the odd buildings 
with awkward doors upon surprisingly sturdy hinges from which men and women 
conduct their many creative business ventures, though they are sparser, the 
people here skinnier and rattier, their eyes sharper, and their weapons 
always at hand. A sharp curve eventually leads across a small bridge to the 
east, eventually plunging even deeper into the (known) underbelly of the 
barony.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

    The signature smell of Fellchantry (jokingly referred to as "Kettermoor
Cologne") wafts in with particular potency from the west, hinting at
the docks to be found in that direction. The aroma, not so much unpleasant
as it is unusual, has strong fishy accents punctuated with less-identifiable
effluvia. Fishmongers exhort the crowds with carny-like shouts, each
extolling the freshness and superiority of their particular wares. The
occasional prostitute wanders through, on their way to providing the
services of Andolor's oldest profession to the dock crowd.

moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the

stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties

stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.

Fellchantry's city guards work hard at the appearance of upholding justice.
In reality the guards are only about two steps removed from being criminals

His Majesty's Court of Justice
    A large dais at the westernmost end of a long walkway is the most prominent
feature of His Majesty's Court of Justice. On it is a simple judge's bench,
its face decorated with the Baron's coat of arms. Those wondering about the
Baron's views on justice can find their questions answered by the large
painting that totally dominates the wall behind the bench. Simply titled,
"Justice," it depicts a woman with a radiant halo and pure white vestments
holding a sword aloft with one elegantly-sandled foot atop a pile of corpses.
It's not exactly the sort of court at whose mercy one throws oneself.
Non-descript hardwood benches are arranged in two aisles so that the
populace may observe the proceedings of the court, though few ever do.
 
  The way back east leads to the Justiciar Headquarters, and to the bustling

Some minutes pass while those few interested in the case settle down in their seats for the hearing.

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha asks, "Jonah Nessim, you stand trial here,
 today, on charges of murder and theft- the appropriation of the Founder's
 jeweled egg.  How do you plead?"

Jonah Nessim says, "Lady Justiciar, I plead innocence, for I had not--"
The woman at the bench interrupts him.

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha says, "Unnamed testimonies proclaim you had been
 in pursuit of Juilus Sannar at the time, and once you tumbled to the
 cobbles, the victim was found bleeding."

Jonah Nessim says, "Lady Justiciar, I was unarmed."

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha asks, "Indeed, you were at the time, though you
 needn't have been.  Juilus was dispossessed of his dirk.  Where had you
 hidden the weapon?"

Detective Bane Jones says, "Lady Justiciar, if I may interject."

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha permits the interruption with a nod, though her mouth tightens.

Detective Bane Jones says, "I had scoured Fellchantry, meticulously - and
 quite brilliantly, if I may add - received several testimonies from
 notable townsfolk on the actual occurences on that day."
Detective Bane Jones says, "If you would permit this submission of
 evidence?  All have been signed as true."

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha says, "Very well, but first.  Jonah Nessim,
 recount the events of the day, lest we eliminate the possibility of
 contradiction."

A bead of sweat forms upon Jonah's brow.

Jonah Nessim says, "We had been pursued by a vile savage, Lady Justiciar,
 no doubt their attempt at procuring the egg for themselves.  We could not
 determine whether it was a man or a woman."
Jonah Nessim says, "What I do recall of their visage, they were cloaked in
 brown with a red heart embroidered at the forehead of the hood."

Jonah Nessim says, "After a brief struggle, we set off and were pursued. 
 We had reached Fellchantry square, though I was sent crown over petticoats
 and crashed into the cobbles below."

Jonah Nessim says, "Alas, once I found my feet, we were left sans pursuer,
 and sans the jeweled egg."

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha says, "The Fellchantry Heart are a children's
 tale, Jonah.  You'd have earned yourself more credibility if not for such
 a ridiculous detail."

Jonah Nessim says, "But, Lady Justiciar--"

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha says, "Silence!  I have been inundated with
 enough such poppycock."

Detective Bane Jones says, "Lady Justiciar, among these testimonies is one
 signed by Baron Kormack himself.  It may behoove you to give it a
 gander."
Detective Bane Jones walks over to the Justiciar and hands over the sheaf of notes.
The Lady Justiciar glances over the sheaf and lets out a resigned shrug.

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha says, "I grant you this, then, Detective.  You
 have three days to find this phantom killer of yours.  If none turn up,
 then Jonah Nessim will be sentenced to drawing and quartering.  I am sure
 you understand why."

The detective nods and turns to you.
Detective Bane Jones says, "You know what to do, KumoGami."

Justiciar Amara ju Nulaha says, "Dismissed.  Lead him back to his
 cells."
The small crowd begins to dissipate and you are herded out of the court.

The locals appear to recognize your pin and allow you to pass into the alleys.
Brimtoil Alley
  Past the northern bustle one comes to the calmer, plainer and saner
environment of Fellchantry's alleyways. There are still the odd buildings 
with awkward doors upon surprisingly sturdy hinges from which men and women 
conduct their many creative business ventures, though they are sparser, the 
people here skinnier and rattier, their eyes sharper, and their weapons 
always at hand. A sharp curve eventually leads across a small bridge to the 
east, eventually plunging even deeper into the (known) underbelly of the 
barony.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

Mesolar's melting pot of debauchery. One may merely cross the Kettermoor to

On the Crickbridge Road
  It was a dark and stormy night...

  There's a saying out in the darker parts of the country that, for a man
in the right kinds of trouble, all roads lead to Fellchantry. They say that
when "No Fear" Narlfryd, the famed Wolfen daredevil, needed a place to lay
low, he came to Fellchantry and knifed a guy over a card game. The story
goes that he wanted to use a vacation in a cell as a chance to let a bad
storm blow over. The authorities didn't give him the chance. They took one
look at that body, shook their heads, and walked the other way. Fellchantry
is just that kind of place. Around here, they're ALL dark and stormy nights,
and the residents like it that way just fine.

  To the east lies the bridge over Kettermoor Crick, the deceptively named
fast-running river that supplies Fellchantry with its ne'erending supply of
fish, trade taxes, and surly attitudes.

park tucked away in a forgotten corner of the barony. The grasses which roll 
across the area are maintained with care, the sparse scattering of trees also
adding to the charm of this 'clearing' between buildings. Several benches are
featured, at least one occupied at all times while children entertain 
themselves in the open space under the supervision of the eternal gloomy sky 
overhead.

Eastwards, one may travel back to the vibrant Oberon Alley.

Dead End in Bottlebreak Alley [**> PK <**]
  This particular pathway comes to an end here. The alley leads up to an 
unoccupied square with most buildings facing away from the alley itself, 
though the odd back door may be spied where servants or tenants would empty 
their chamberpots out onto the cobble underfoot. Wheels with wire along their
edges are mounted from east to west, top-floor tenants pinning and rolling 
(rare) laundry out to dry. Some of those textiles still drip beneath the 
eternal gloom of Fellchantry.

Bottlebreak Alley [**> PK <**]
  The smells wafting through this alley are less charming than those elsewhere 
within the Barony, but not bad enough for one to run for the hills. Folk who 
traffic here tend to always have a bottle tucked beneath an arm, however, as 
they move from one seedy tavern to another, eyeing anyone who they may not 
recognize suspiciously. Words can be had about the general odour of unwashed 
bodies, however. The state of the surrounding buildings does not suggest 
dilapidation to the point where its denizens should look and smell the way 
they do, though the feeling of complacency hangs thick in the air.

Murder Alley
  A bit of a narrower path between buildings, this area does not seem to 
receive a lot of traffic. The buildings which flank the road to the north and
south are a bit more ramshackle, the air feels a bit colder, and the ground 
is a bit grimier. Upon closer inspection of the northern building, one may 
notice the trademark giving this passage its name. A splash of dark paint 
(someone dropped a bucket, no doubt) smears across the wall, the impact 
having left many spots, giving one the illusion that a throat was cut.

  A rather open space for an alley, a multitude of tables and chairs are 
scattered around the area, serving as a quaint space for an outdoor drink or 
smoke among the regulars in this area. Some of the doors against the eastern 
buildings lead towards shops, some to homes, and others to homes with their 
back rooms converted into shops, all selling a series of curious wares of 
varying value. The cobblestones underfoot appear to be dark and glisten 
always, as if moistened under the toil of recent rains despite the 
ever-present overhead gloom.

Bogboil Bridge
  Some may call it a bridge, others may call it a hack, but the fact that it 
allows people to cross water is one set in stone. A multitude of planks run 
from one end of the stone pavement across a narrow river from the western to 
the eastern side. The tightly-packed buildings receive a bit of a gap here, 
though one may spy that a few brave souls have taken it upon themselves to 
construct ramshackle balconies in order to appreciate their 'ocean view'.
Eastwards, the alleyways split at an intersection and vanish beyond sight.

Brimtoil Alley
  Past the northern bustle one comes to the calmer, plainer and saner
environment of Fellchantry's alleyways. There are still the odd buildings 
with awkward doors upon surprisingly sturdy hinges from which men and women 
conduct their many creative business ventures, though they are sparser, the

on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky

    The signature smell of Fellchantry (jokingly referred to as "Kettermoor
Cologne") wafts in with particular potency from the west, hinting at
the docks to be found in that direction. The aroma, not so much unpleasant
as it is unusual, has strong fishy accents punctuated with less-identifiable
effluvia. Fishmongers exhort the crowds with carny-like shouts, each
extolling the freshness and superiority of their particular wares. The
occasional prostitute wanders through, on their way to providing the
services of Andolor's oldest profession to the dock crowd.

Fellchantry's city guards work hard at the appearance of upholding justice.
In reality the guards are only about two steps removed from being criminals
themselves, and the sour reek of tobacco, alcohol, and sweat on the air says
much about the Justiciars' efficacy. Still, the Baron's coat of arms hangs
large on the wall, and that's all the legitimacy these men need.

Fellchantry Square
  For all Fellchantry's Square's boasting of a dense population, here the 
moving and close press of bodies is less apparent. Sparser, in fact, the 
closer one moves towards the hulking drawbridge which lies eastwards and is 
stationed with men in glimmering armor and pointy weapons of all varieties 
and levels of use. Beyond the bridge and an impressive distance into the sky 
stretches a fort, littered with arrow slits and even more pointy materials 
leveled towards the grounds below.
 
To the north, south and west, the Square continues to sprawl out and avail 
itself of the free (yet more dangerous) space offered here.

Fellchantry Square
  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

Brimtoil Alley
  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Further south, the alleyway eventually twists east and out of sight.

Fellchantry Square
  Most of the traffic at this intersection of the square is either coming
from or going toward the south. The third most corrupt organization in the
city (after its government, and its law enforcement) has its guild hall in
that direction, and with the recent trade talks announced by the Baron there
are plenty of foreigners and citizens alike who feel the need to visit the
Merchant's Guild. Hatred and bigotry wash from Fellchantry's citizens in a
palpable wave toward the outlanders with their strange features, strange
clothing, and strange ways. Likewise in a southerly direction are the homes
of some of Fellchantry's more affluent, non-royal citizens, as well as
several other guild halls. There is even said to be an assassin's guild,
but who can afford to believe everything they hear?
   
  Affluence is to the south, along with all the dark deeds it can buy. The
press of stinking bodies in the square is all around.

The Heart of the Mystery
  Alas, some foul tragedy seems to have occurred here, for nothing else
could so reliably draw such a diverse crowd of onlookers. Loud cries of
"Murder most foul!" and "What villainy!" abound. At the center of the
whole mess, mayhap literally as well as figuratively, stand a group of His
Majesty's Justiciars observing one very dead body. The darkness of the
deed and the storm of intrigue sure to follow are a fitting complement to
the dark and stormy nights so common in the Barony.

  Fellchantry Square stretches out in all directions, oblivious to the
fact that Death has paid a visit nearby.

In the constant hell of the Barony, this is where the honest (and you have

The Bridge Over Kettermoor Crick
    The rushing waters of Kettermoor Crick flow far below this sturdy stone
bridge. In the miserable old days, the people that first settled this
godsforsaken scar of land built the bridge to access Fellchantry-- the squat,
sprawling island that sits astride the river like the biggest bully in the
schoolyard. Or so they say anyway... Really, it'd make just as much sense if
they built the bridge to give themselves something high enough to jump from.
Fellchantry isn't what you'd call a vacation spot. The water is colder
and darker than a witch's heart. The fog-- like a mourner's veil-- stretches
perpetually over the land, as if the sun just can't eat a big enough
breakfast to ever cook it off. This is where dreams go to die.

  To the west the Crickbridge Road leads away from town. To the east the city
of Fellchantry looms, looking like the saddest verse of the most dismal dirge
you've ever heard. If the word on the street is true, then the murdered smith
is somewhere inside, his body giving off the putrescent stench of a mystery.

On the Crickbridge Road
  It was a dark and stormy night...

  There's a saying out in the darker parts of the country that, for a man
in the right kinds of trouble, all roads lead to Fellchantry. They say that
when "No Fear" Narlfryd, the famed Wolfen daredevil, needed a place to lay
low, he came to Fellchantry and knifed a guy over a card game. The story
goes that he wanted to use a vacation in a cell as a chance to let a bad
storm blow over. The authorities didn't give him the chance. They took one
look at that body, shook their heads, and walked the other way. Fellchantry
is just that kind of place. Around here, they're ALL dark and stormy nights,
and the residents like it that way just fine.

  To the east lies the bridge over Kettermoor Crick, the deceptively named
fast-running river that supplies Fellchantry with its ne'erending supply of
fish, trade taxes, and surly attitudes.

With only the force of his will, the caster can rise into the air and
soar with the eagles.  A character that is flying does not need a boat
to cross deep water, and will not be hindered by quicksand.

Races that have the ability to fly naturally can type 'fly' and 'land'
at any time outside combat. The ability to use 'land' to cancel a fly effect
is not available to others.

Potions of flight are also available at various stores throughout Andolor,
including Aeleron's Alchemy supplies in Aylor.

You wake and stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

this was once a battlefield of the worthy and ruthless

this field is still be used as a training center, and
an older man in a brown uniform who is as tough as

Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Story-Teller says, "This is a story of Bramadin.  It is a story of
 Elbryan.  It is a story of Arisia.  But most of all, it is a story of
 Allora."

The Story-Teller says, "What can I tell you of Allora?  Her beauty shone
 brighter than the moon.  Her hair rivaled the sun and put it to shame with
 the glory of its golden flow.  Her eyes were deeper than the ocean and
 cast back a reflection of the sky at sunset.  Everyone loved her, from the
 rudest peasant picking through the garbage on the street, to the King
 himself.  But most of all, she was loved by Bramadin and Elbryan."

The Story-Teller says, "Elbryan was a young man then, proud of himself and
 his position.  He had no true evil in his heart, then or now, but his
 pride was o'erweening, and would prove to be the death of the ones he
 loved most dearly.  He was tall and golden, a shining prince and beloved
 of the city, and of Allora."


Furlos (Recruit) tells the CLAN: 'yes, thank you. perhaps i should make a note of that. :)'
You no longer absorb magical attacks.

The Story-Teller says, "Bramadin was young and headstrong then, but even
 in his youth his great future shone out of his eyes.  He fought great
 battles and made great jests in his youth, far removed from the years of
 his maturity.  His deeds in the later years were, perhaps, greater than in
 his youth, but nothing could compare with the glory and joy when he
 pursued Allora.  Even after he was called the Mad Mage, his love proved
 his sanity and his dedication cleansed his soul."


Saraid (General) tells the CLAN: 'so guessing you classchanged'

The Story-Teller says, "The rivalry between Elbryan and Bramadin did not
 diminish their friendship in any way.  Although they competed in all
 things for the love and attention of Allora, in truth they were closer
 than brothers and loved each other with greater fervor than any family. 
 And Allora, beautiful and wise, loved them both equally and could not
 choose between their suits."


Saraid (General) tells the CLAN: 'imo you should subclass change to shaman if you want to be ranger'

The Story-Teller says, "That was a time of greatness for Arisia.  The
 goblin hordes in the mountains were decimated, and Bramadin brought back
 the young goblins to learn civilization and serve within the city for
 their lifespans.  Elbryan earned the sobriquette 'Golden Tongue' for his
 diplomacy and proved his worth with treaties and trade agreements from
 here to the fabled City of Aylor itself."


Saraid (General) tells the CLAN: 'it's stronger'

You feel your light blue aura fade.

You feel your elemental ward fade.

The Story-Teller says, "It was in the year of the Dolphin that the Great
 Goddess set a drought upon the land and the sea.  The city burned, and the
 people starved.  The priests and monks beseeched the Goddess for relief,
 but they only ever received one word in reply: Eddore."


The Story-Teller says, "Elbryan himself set forth, never minding he was
 our Prince and Heir, to the island nation of Eddore.  With him rode
 Bramadin and Silver Gloves, a proud youth who often stood as companion to
 the two near brothers, and was in fact brother to the glorious Allora. 
 While Elbryan charmed the King and Queen of Eddore with his golden voice
 and silvered tongue, Bramadin and Silver Gloves set forth into the city to
 find the source of such purulent evil that the Goddess herself cast forth
 a punishment on all her children."


Praying to the Goddess of Nature, fishermen head toward their ships.

The Story-Teller says, "And found it they did.  A cult of the Spider God,
 Siltharyn, had set up a foul temple within the city walls itself.  Far
 from burning it out, root and branch, the King and Queen of Eddore were
 funding this vile cult and attending services within the blackened and
 malodorous chambers.  Aghast, Bramadin, Elbryan and Silver Gloves fled
 back to Arisia to report their findings and serve on the war councils
 responsible for burning out the foulness."


Furlos (Recruit) tells the CLAN: 'ok, i'll try that. thanks'

The Story-Teller says, "It was then Arisia rose up, weakened and starving
 though it was, and swept across the ocean to Eddore.  Great were the
 battles and glorious the heroes who emerged from that war.  Thousands
 died, both Arisian and Edorrian, but in the end Arisia stood as the
 victor.  The Great Goddess then raised her hand in wrath one last time and
 swept the remains of broken Eddore into the ocean."


Saraid (General) tells the CLAN: 'crafter is kind of high end'

The Story-Teller says, "Alas, during the final day of the battle, Bramadin
 received a fatal wound, a dagger slipped through to his heart from an
 erstwhile friend turned traitor and spider worshipper.  His body was
 carried in state to Arisia, there to be buried at the right hand of the
 old King, whose heart had failed during that final battle as well."


Saraid (General) tells the CLAN: 'though you can totally try it'

>>> Furlos has joined the Shaman guild. <<<

Saraid (General) tells the CLAN: 'nice!'
The Story-Teller says, "Great was the weeping and wailing as the bier of
 Bramadin was carried into the city.  Allora, filled with premonitions of
 doom, emerged from the White Tower where she reigned as Arch-Magister of
 the city, and saw the funereal procession.  Her face white and her heart
 colder than the icy marble of the northern mountains, she pulled back the
 pall to see who lay in stately death."


The Story-Teller says, "With a cry, she fell to the ground, weeping and
 calling out Bramadin's name.  None could console her, not even Elbryan. 
 After the funeral, in despair and anguish, she sealed herself in the White
 Tower, setting a spell upon the doors that they could only be unlocked
 through the Goddess' Sphere, held within the Palace itself.  None can
 speak of her fate, for none have seen her glorious face since that day."


The Story-Teller says, "Elbryan eventually married, a beautiful and kind
 woman, but in his heart Allora is still his only and truest bride. 
 Bramadin's tomb, now covered in marble sheathes and flowers, is considered
 the holiest place within the city of Arisia.  And still Allora weeps in
 her White Tower, weeps for her lost love and innocence.  On clear nights,
 when the moon again shows her face, unrivalled by the glory of Allora's
 beauty, the weeping can be heard from the farthest beaches to the distant
 farms.  And none can console her, for she lies locked within the Dolphin's
 Sphere in the Palace."


Anssett (Special Ops) tells the CLAN: 'crafter is less about fast leveling and more about making
skinnable corpses fast. they'r enot quite the same thing'

The Story-Teller says, "All is not lost, however.  Silver Gloves carries
 on him the key to opening that charmed Tower.  If you speak my name to
 him, he may give you this key, for the fate of Allora weighs heavily upon
 his heart and mind."


** Goal Added : Free Allora from her White Tower.
   Type 'goals arisian' for full details on this goal.

** Task Added : Speak the name of Bramadin's brother to Silver Gloves.

Your moral standing is no longer cloaked.

The Story-Teller says, "Oh, my name?  It is Bramador.  I am the brother of
 the fallen Bramadin.  His soul rests within my memories and his spirit
 guides me always."

  The gates of Arisia's Palace are standing south from here.  This place is
not as big as you were told, but the castle is really beautiful.  The gates
are sculpted in precious wood, and it seems that many precious stones
(perhaps diamonds and sapphires) are encrusted in the gates.  The place is
heavily guarded, and you wonder which treasures this magnificent palace
could hold.

 these many years.  Are you here to release her?"
The Crystal Dolphin peers at you intently.
The crystal dolphin says, "Simply touch the key to the sphere, and you
 will be taken to Allora.  From there, you must convince her to come home
 again.  I do not know what you can say that might convince her, but speak
 to her of her brother or of Bramadin's brother, and perhaps she will
 listen."
The crystal dolphin sighs.
The crystal dolphin moves slowly towards you and hands you a small figure.
The crystal dolphin says, "I've been alone such a long time. Here is my

The crystal dolphin says, "Come and visit me after you have asked the

Allora the White says, "Elbryan.  He wears the mantle of purity, but
 jealousy so ate at his heart in those long-ago days.  He couldn't bear the
 shame that I might choose a commoner over him.  He paid an assassin, in
 the heat of the battle, to kill my love.  I woke from a dream of it, and
 then his shattered corpse was borne into the city, confirming all my
 fears."

Praying to the Goddess of Nature, fishermen head toward their ships.

You return to the living world.

Allora the White asks, "It has taken me many years to devise a plan of
 vengeance for my love.  Many years of research and cunning.  There are
 three things I need for the potion I am seeking.  If you will bring them
 back to me, and then help me to the fruition of my plans, I will reward
 you well.  Will you help?"

Furlos (Recruit) tells the CLAN: 'yes'

Allora the White says, "The requirements of the potion are simple - an
 item touched by the Goddess, or one of her avatars.  I know there has
 always been such an avatar within this city, it guards the Goddess Sphere
 itself.  I do not know what form the blessed item will take, but the
 purity of Her touch will shine out of it, letting me know it when I hold
 it within my hands."

Allora the White says, "The second item I need is a bird's feather.  It
 must be a sea bird, preferably one which has resided its life within the
 holy web the Goddess casts around her blessed cities.  There were only two
 cities within this plane of existence blessed by the Goddess, and one of
 them was swept into the ocean by Her hand."


Allora the White says, "The final item I need is a garment worn by the
 woman the traitor calls Queen.  Within any royal garment, protections long
 used by the Royal Family have been woven, and from these protections I
 must pull the true essence of the traitor, that my potion might work upon
 him.  A garment worn by him will not work, as the protections there also
 guard against discovery of his essence."

Allora the White says, "Now go!  And do not return until you have
 retrieved all three items for me."

are sculpted in precious wood, and it seems that many precious stones
(perhaps diamonds and sapphires) are encrusted in the gates.  The place is
heavily guarded, and you wonder which treasures this magnificent palace
could hold.

give potion king
You give a small crystal bottle to the King Elbryan.
The King Elbryan asks, "Ah!  This is from Allora, you say?  Could it be,
 after all these years, she finally forgives me?"
The King Elbryan sighs.
The King Elbryan says, "I have spent so many years thinking of what I
 could do differently.  Alas, Allora was lost to us all by then.  My
 beloved Beth has been a treasure, and I love her as dearly as I loved
 Allora."
Elbryan smiles mistily.
The King Elbryan says, "I will drink this in her memory, and pray she one
 day returns to us."
Elbryan raises the crystal bottle and drinks the potion.  A thunderclap
sounds in the room as he falls to the floor, clutching his stomach.
A bright flash of light blinds everyone for a moment, and when your
vision clears, Allora is standing over the writhing form of the King
Elbryan, laughing madly.  Her black, glittering eyes remind you of a
spider's dispassionate gaze, and she is dressed in black cobwebs and
spidersilk.
Allora screams in fury when she sees you standing over Elbryan's
fallen body.
Allora the Black exclaims, "Traitor!  You have killed my love!  Elbryan! 
 Elbryan, my beloved!"
Wow, she's a fruitloop.
You dodge Allora the Black's attack.
Elbryan reaches towards you, weakly gesturing.
The King Elbryan exclaims, "Quickly, you must reach the Healer!  He is a
 priest of the Goddess and will know how to defeat this evil!"
Elbryan coughs weakly.
The King Elbryan says, "Flee....flee for your life....flee...."
Allora the Black is in perfect health.

 not interpret them.  Such is my failure."
The Healer sighs.
The Healer says, "But you are here now, and ready to defeat the mad
 creature Allora has become.  It is, perhaps, our greatest tragedy.  She
 was such a kind and loving child, and a sweet-tempered woman.  Truly
 beloved of the Goddess, if Bramadin had lived who knows what wonders she
 might have wrought.  But now...now there is nothing to do but slay the
 shadow she has become.  Alas and woe to our fair city."
The Healer looks sadly at you and reaches under his counter.
The Healer says, "Here we are.  You must stand before the Sphere of the
 Goddess and say these words:  Allora Tempora Majora Denali."
The Healer repeats these words several times, to impress them upon your memory.
The Healer says, "And when Allora appears to slay you, you must recite
 these words: Allora synari mystara mortalis.  This will release her soul
 into the care of the Goddess, and free our city from her mad grasp."
