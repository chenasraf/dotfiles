Whitewind Avenue (G)
  You stand on Whitewind Avenue before a large intersection with a massive
statue and numerous people.  The city around you is incredible, with amazing
architecture, breathtaking horizons, and finely crafted roadwork.  Beneath
your feet, the road is made of a white translucent stone, likely quartz,
that sparkles in the sunlight.  To the north, the grand Aylorian Temple
stands high above the city.

  At this, the main intersection of the Grand City of Aylor, the road is
shiny and black as if paved with ebony.  The road extends east and west,
reaching across the entire city.  In the center of this large square stands
a black and pink alabaster statue.  Beneath the statue, many solicitors try
to grab the attention of passersby.  To the north is the white marble temple. 
To the south, you gaze upon a large plaza with eight silver spires piercing
the sky.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

>>  The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

s
>>  Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

>>  The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

see a large residential part that hosts a large attraction that the local
residents are very proud.  Beyond the houses to the east, you can hear the
laughter of children and the splashing of water in the distance.  Residents

their future legacies.

  Long ago, at the height of its power, the Dragon Cult built this road as
a service to its enormous following.  The road, like so many other things in
the land was named for the mighty creatures which were held in awe by the
early inhabitants of the land.  The cult itself made a worship out of the
large beasts, thinking them gods.  While the Dragon Cult still exists today,
its following is greatly diminished, but the road remains.  It is a paved
road, but not so wide as the Aylorian or Andolor highways.  It is used as a
trail for the few worshippers who still travel to the cult's headquarters,
but nowadays, it is the main trading route across the southern portion of
the continent.  At this point, it connects with the wide Great Andolor
Highway, which will lead travellers into the city of Aylor, if followed
northwards.  The Dragon Road continues east and west from here.

seeing a single tree or hill.  This wide expanse of flat land has an
abundance of life, however; rabbits, badgers, foxes, and mice are just a few
of the types of animals one can expect to see out here.  Also, there are
many wild grains and edible plants which the animals and nomadic peoples of
Mesolar can easily find and make use of for food.  Many adventurers should
find the foraging easy enough, as well.  To the north, the Dragon Road runs
east and west, eventually connecting with a dull forest trail to the east.

smoking crater, branches and bark stripped and gone. Most of the trunks have 
been thoroughly burnt, leaving long trails of ash pointing away from the 
crater. Those trees that are more than ash seem to be made of charcoal. You 
reach out to feel a piece, but pull your hand back before you burn yourself.

a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a

Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Long ago, at the height of its power, the Dragon Cult built this road as
a service to its enormous following.  The road, like so many other things in
the land was named for the mighty creatures which were held in awe by the
early inhabitants of the land.  The cult itself made a worship out of the
large beasts, thinking them gods.  While the Dragon Cult still exists today,
its following is greatly diminished, but the road remains.  It is a paved
road, but not so wide as the Aylorian or Andolor highways.  It is used as a
trail for the few worshippers who still travel to the cult's headquarters,
but nowadays, it is the main trading route across the southern portion of
the continent.  At this point, it connects with the wide Great Andolor
Highway, which will lead travellers into the city of Aylor, if followed
northwards.  The Dragon Road continues east and west from here.

seeing a single tree or hill.  This wide expanse of flat land has an
abundance of life, however; rabbits, badgers, foxes, and mice are just a few
of the types of animals one can expect to see out here.  Also, there are
many wild grains and edible plants which the animals and nomadic peoples of
Mesolar can easily find and make use of for food.  Many adventurers should
find the foraging easy enough, as well.  To the north, the Dragon Road runs
east and west, eventually connecting with a dull forest trail to the east.

  The rocks beneath the surface have created large rapids. The rapid currents 
attempt to smash you against the rocks while the undercurrents seek to draw 
you beneath the surface. The water foams as it smashes against the rocks. It 
isn't safe to stay here, perhaps you should swim to the calmer waters to the 
north or south.

>>  Following the Stream
  The stream runs rapidly, pulling you along with minimal effort. Beside you, 
fish jump in the water making big splashes with each jump. The sun reflects 
off the water, creating a blinding effect so you need to shade your eyes.
Some large rocks are visible in the water to the north, while the stream bank
is to the south.

>>  Standing on Shore
  You are standing on the shore of a stream. The brush on both sides is too 
dense to pass through, so the only way to go is through the stream. Trees 
line the edges of the stream, providing shelter from the sun. The shore is 
covered with grass and mud, while large rocks are visible within the water.
Perhaps it would be safest if you obtained a boat.

  The dirt path has cracked from the sun overhead which has sucked all the 
moisture out of the dirt. The air pulsates in waves from the oppressive heat.
The fields beside the path are brown and brittle from lack of water. To the 
east some trees are visible, and offer shade to a weary traveller. The path 
continues to the east and west.

A Forest Path
  The forest path is black as night. The trees above block out the natural 
light. The trees above you wave, even though there is no wind. The path is 
surrounded by bushes which block your view of anything alongside the path.
Bandits seem to love this path.

  Deep in the woods, the dense canopy of trees blocks out the sun and creates a
night-like atmosphere. The sounds of the forest quiet as you approach, and an
ominous silence pervades the area. Yellow eyes stare at you from the 
darkness, so it would be best to stay on the path.
