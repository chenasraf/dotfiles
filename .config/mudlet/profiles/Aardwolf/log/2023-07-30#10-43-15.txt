There are few things in this world as breathtaking as the Aylorian skyline at dawn.

Someone scans all directions, looking for signs of life.

You feel yourself moving more quickly.

Someone touches you and your eyes glow red.

You fade out of existence.

You are surrounded by Someone's force shield.

Someone makes your appearance look blurred.

You feel a strong magical force surround your body.

You feel gills growing on your neck!

You feel your body harden.

Help Keywords : Help.
Help Category : Information.
Related Helps : Contents, Index.
Last Updated  : 2013-01-31 22:18:28.

Syntax: help <keyword>           : Display help on given keyword.
        help search <keyword(s)> : List all help files containing keyword.

Aardwolf has an extensive list of help files available (over 1100 total).
These cover all topics- command syntax, policies/rules, history, husband, 
wife, work, and many more.

To access a help file, simply type 'help <keyword>' (for example, 'help
kick' or 'help magic missile'). The MUD will attempt to guess what help you
are looking for and display it if there is only one, or display a list of
options if several possibilities exist.

You may use the 'contents' command to see a list of all helpfiles based on
a particular topic.  Type 'contents' with no argument to see a list of
available categories.  Type 'contents <categoryname>' to see all help
files in that category.

You may also use the 'index' command to see all help files that begin with
a certain letter or letters, as well as a short description for each.  See
'help index' for more information.  Similarly, you may use 'help search
<keyword(s)>' to list help files which contain the given string ('help
search cure', etc.).

If you are a new player trying to figure out where to start, please read
'help newhelp'.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask on the
newbie channel (see 'help newbietalk') or other channels ('help channels').

(Note- some help files have additional, unlisted keywords.  This makes help
files more accessible while reducing clutter, and is intentional.)
