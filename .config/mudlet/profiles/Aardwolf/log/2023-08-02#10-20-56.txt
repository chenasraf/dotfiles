Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

>>   Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  At this, the main intersection of the Grand City of Aylor, the road is
shiny and black as if paved with ebony.  The road extends east and west,
reaching across the entire city.  In the center of this large square stands
a black and pink alabaster statue.  Beneath the statue, many solicitors try
to grab the attention of passersby.  To the north is the white marble temple. 
To the south, you gaze upon a large plaza with eight silver spires piercing
the sky.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

Quanah Parker says, "There's been a pissing match going on between

 bigger than the bee's knees.  Back then, Mrs. James, their mama, doted on
 the Marshall.  His younger brother, Jake, was pretty much left to his own
 devices, and spent his time killing off pet cats and pulling the wings
 offa flies."

notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  You stand before a huge door.  The corridor can easily fit fifteen humans
standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

Stone Archway
  A chilled breeze rushes through the dark, rough-hewn cavern. The walls are 
covered in scripts and glyphs, visible through an eerie glow that barely 
penetrates the darkness. Broken planks and discarded potion bottles litter 
the floor and a sign of some sort is engraved with a message.

[ Exits: west up ]
A piece of the cavern ceiling crumbles to the ground startling you.

A Dusty Stairwell
  A short flight of flagstone stairs end here in a dusty stairwell. Garbled 
voices, music and the pounding of feet come from above. The steps are covered
in a thin layer of stone dust, and upon closer inspection, reveals cloven 
hoofprints of some kind. The stairs lead upwards, and there is a short 
passageway and a door to the south.

  Another room which has the air of enforcement about it, this dimly lit
place leaves the scent of sweat heavy in the nostrils.  Dark red stains on
the walls and floors leave no doubt that this is a place where one's guard
should never be let down.  The sounds here are more subdued, having left the
hectic market and other distractions above.  Serious business is
accomplished in these halls, and there is no doubt as to the penalty for
causing mischief.

  A small fire ahead lights the room warmly.  There appears to be a stone
counter and a scratched and stained stool behind it, but no one to help run
the place.  A glass block in the counter allows the viewing of various
scrolls.  Unlike the usual scrolls one sees, these are stained black with
red writing and are burned at the edges.  A small sign says "Buyer Beware -
Scrolls not guaranteed."

  The cavern walls are narrow here, with barely room to move forward or

silence.  A decision must be made: to continue west, into the deepest depths
of these caverns, or to head east, perhaps to escape these caves forever.

  There is a great deal of evidence in this room indicating it is used for
testing.  The things which are tested here range from unpleasant to outright
mind-numbingly unbearable.  Portions of bodies, many of which are
unrecognizable beyond being bloody chunks, are scattered about.  The walls
seem to still reverberate with the sound of pained screams.  The longer a
body lingers in this room, the more discomforting it becomes.  This can be a

Associates' Hallway
  This corridor is appointed with fine carpeting, and a certain sense of
aesthetic appeal.  The walls are adorned with hangings which absorb sound. 
This corridor is stagnant otherwise -- nothing to smell, nothing to hear, no
eddies of air moving across the flesh.

  In the corner of this room is an odd-looking device.  It appears to be
molded from silver, and has a very menacing look about it.  Strange noises
emanate from it, reverberating about the room in an eerie manner.  Beneath
the machine lies what looks to be a puddle of blood, with silver fleck in
it.  The purpose for this 'thing' is unclear.  For now.

  There is a great deal of evidence in this room indicating it is used for
testing.  The things which are tested here range from unpleasant to outright
mind-numbingly unbearable.  Portions of bodies, many of which are
unrecognizable beyond being bloody chunks, are scattered about.  The walls
seem to still reverberate with the sound of pained screams.  The longer a
body lingers in this room, the more discomforting it becomes.  This can be a
true test of endurance.

enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Plaza Gates
  Almost as formidable as the gates at the City's entrance, these protect
Pandemonium's nobility from invasion of their elite sanctum.  The road
slopes upward sharply, as if discouraging would-be treaders, and the City

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  To the north is the grandest castle of all- that owned by the King
himself, and from which he administers the land.

The Training Field
  The field stretches for acres, surrounded by a high iron wall.  Near the
entrance are endless racks of practice weapons, their bloodstained wood
polished to a high gleam.  Here, mock battles take place, keeping the Black
Guard's skills honed to absolute perfection.  And perfection it must be, for
Prince Beelzebub himself, commander of the Black Guard, oversees all, and he
does not tolerate anything less.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Plaza Gates
  Almost as formidable as the gates at the City's entrance, these protect
Pandemonium's nobility from invasion of their elite sanctum.  The road
slopes upward sharply, as if discouraging would-be treaders, and the City

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

  The epitome of the perfect military installation, the courtyard almost
hums with the activity of soldiers and their support staff.  Demons march in
drills, perfectly in step.  A chow line is set up at the far end, and the
serving Damned ladling out greasy stew each bear the mark of Nephelus on his
or her forehead.  There is no idle chatter here, though the shouts of
officers and sergeants ring through the yard, trying to be heard over each

The Stone Palace
  Prince Moloch reigns here, almost invariably seated at the large table
that serves as the nerve center of his domain.  Maps of the realm crowd each
other, as the Prince of War consults with his minions, considering his next
move in his neverending struggle to unite the princedoms under his own
aegis.

Courtyard of the Stone Palace
  The epitome of the perfect military installation, the courtyard almost
hums with the activity of soldiers and their support staff.  Demons march in
drills, perfectly in step.  A chow line is set up at the far end, and the
serving Damned ladling out greasy stew each bear the mark of Nephelus on his
or her forehead.  There is no idle chatter here, though the shouts of
officers and sergeants ring through the yard, trying to be heard over each
other.

  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

It's a narrow alley, and nobody seems to care that trash chokes it now and

alive.  For this is one of the favorite haunts for muggers and those looking
to spill a little blood just for fun, and every being that walks through is
careful to keep a weapon close at hand.

  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur
is never eliminated completely.

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Iron Maiden (G)
  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

The Arena [**> PK <**]
  The arena is quite long, giving anybody who wants to practice their
combat skills plenty of room.  Demons who bear allegiance to no Prince, the
gladiators owned by the city, and even Damned are welcome here.  There's
even practice weapons of all types provided.  Of course, there's a downside
to all this generosity- fight /too/ well, and one might find themselves
forced into death combat for the entertainment of the masses.  Still, that
doesn't keep would-be warriors from flocking to the Arena, and the sounds of
combat never die away.  This end tends to be less utilized, though, due to
the broken rock underfoot.

The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,

twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

  You /know/ you've always wanted your very own Damned to take home and
cuddle and feed and wuv and name George.  Or how about a partially tamed
maw, to watch your home while you're away?  (Ceeg's Pet Bazaar cannot be
held responsible for bloodstains resulting from break-ins, however.)  And
for those with a little more gold to spend, perhaps a Damned reshaped into
whatever your imagination can come up with.  Ceeg is most accommodating.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the

the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

The Iron Maiden (G)
  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur
is never eliminated completely.

  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

Pandemonium Marketplace
  Easily the busiest place in the city, the Pandemonium Marketplace is a
broad square of flagstone easily covering half an acre.  Not only shops are
available here, but kiosks can be, and are, set up as well.  Every item
imaginable is available here, and at all hours of the day and night.  The
buzz of deals being struck can be constantly heard, interspersed with a
shout now and then as those dickering get a bit excited.

  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris.  Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur is
never eliminated completely.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone

induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Warren
  Red dust blown by winds of almost unbearable heat turns everything, even
the very air, the color of dried blood.  Where it comes from, nobody knows,
for the ground has been packed into stony hardness broken by dark cracks. 
This is the Warren- a sprawling collection of ramshackle hovels stretching
as far as the eye can see.  The stench of sulfur hangs heavy in the air. 
Not a pleasant place to live.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to

  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe

to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

Blood Alley
  It's along this alley that the majority of the city's citizens live. 
It's a narrow alley, and nobody seems to care that trash chokes it now and
then.  The stench is largely ignored in favor of making sure one stays
alive.  For this is one of the favorite haunts for muggers and those looking
to spill a little blood just for fun, and every being that walks through is
careful to keep a weapon close at hand.

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough

thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure.

induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Deception Boulevard
  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur
is never eliminated completely.

M'mog's Tavern [**> PK <**]
  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

  Easily the busiest place in the city, the Pandemonium Marketplace is a
broad square of flagstone easily covering half an acre.  Not only shops are
available here, but kiosks can be, and are, set up as well.  Every item
imaginable is available here, and at all hours of the day and night.  The
buzz of deals being struck can be constantly heard, interspersed with a
shout now and then as those dickering get a bit excited.

  The Rialto is a general store, selling a little bit of everything.  Need
some travel rations for that long journey?  This is the place to acquire
them.  Or how about a wilted flower for that special someone?  A cloak to
hide your lovely features while you assassinate that demon lord?  Got one,
right here.  Feel free to browse, but if you break it, you buy it.  And that
includes the staff.

Pandemonium Marketplace
  Easily the busiest place in the city, the Pandemonium Marketplace is a
broad square of flagstone easily covering half an acre.  Not only shops are
available here, but kiosks can be, and are, set up as well.  Every item
imaginable is available here, and at all hours of the day and night.  The
buzz of deals being struck can be constantly heard, interspersed with a
shout now and then as those dickering get a bit excited.

Ceeg's Pet Bazaar
  You /know/ you've always wanted your very own Damned to take home and
cuddle and feed and wuv and name George.  Or how about a partially tamed
maw, to watch your home while you're away?  (Ceeg's Pet Bazaar cannot be
held responsible for bloodstains resulting from break-ins, however.)  And
for those with a little more gold to spend, perhaps a Damned reshaped into
whatever your imagination can come up with.  Ceeg is most accommodating.

The Rialto
  The Rialto is a general store, selling a little bit of everything.  Need
some travel rations for that long journey?  This is the place to acquire
them.  Or how about a wilted flower for that special someone?  A cloak to
hide your lovely features while you assassinate that demon lord?  Got one,
right here.  Feel free to browse, but if you break it, you buy it.  And that
includes the staff.

Deception Boulevard
  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris.  Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur is
never eliminated completely.

The Iron Maiden (G)
  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

Pandemonium's nobility from invasion of their elite sanctum.  The road

  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  It's along this alley that the majority of the city's citizens live. 
It's a narrow alley, and nobody seems to care that trash chokes it now and
then.  The stench is largely ignored in favor of making sure one stays
alive.  For this is one of the favorite haunts for muggers and those looking
to spill a little blood just for fun, and every being that walks through is
careful to keep a weapon close at hand.

  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur
is never eliminated completely.

M'mog's Tavern [**> PK <**]
  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

  Easily the busiest place in the city, the Pandemonium Marketplace is a
broad square of flagstone easily covering half an acre.  Not only shops are
available here, but kiosks can be, and are, set up as well.  Every item
imaginable is available here, and at all hours of the day and night.  The
buzz of deals being struck can be constantly heard, interspersed with a
shout now and then as those dickering get a bit excited.

  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

The Iron Maiden (G)
  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

Syntax:  campaign         : Lists all campaign commands.
         campaign request : Command to request a new campaign.
         campaign info    : List current CP mobs or check if CP is available.

Campaigns are a mix of the regular questing system and Global Quests with
a bit of extra challenge.  You are assigned a handful of monsters to kill,
which are slightly higher level and spread across many areas.  For the
extra effort, rewards are higher than those from regular quests.

To request a campaign, find Commander Barcett above Hester's Whoswhatsit
off Starlight Way in Aylor (the 'find' command will help) and 'campaign
request'. You can also request a campaign at any Questmaster.

You may undertake only one campaign per level.  If you request a campaign
and level while completing it, you may take another campaign at the new
level.  Campaigns do not stack, however; if you level more than once while
on a campaign, you do not get to take two additional campaigns at the new
level.  See 'help noexp' to prevent extra leveling while on campaigns.

Superheroes may take new campaigns every 2 hours (provided the previous
campaign is completed).  Superhero campaigns will generally have more 
targets than other campaigns.

Like quests, campaigns do have a time limit (though it is much longer than
quests); unlike quests, this timer counts down whether online or offline,
and you may quit the game without losing your campaign.

'campaign info' will tell you if you may campaign at the current level, or
your current campaign's level, rewards, and list of targets.  'campaign
check' strips most of this information and lists only the targets you have
yet to kill.  There is no [QUEST] flag on campaign targets.

Most campaigns will list your target's name and the area in which they are
located.  Some campaigns will only list the room name rather than the area.
If a monster on your list is killed in a room name campaign, it will list
the area instead until it returns.

If, for any reason, you do not wish to continue your campaign, you may use
'campaign quit' to abandon it.  You do not get any rewards and must level
before taking another campaign.  Once you kill your last target, rewards
are given automatically; there is no command to complete a campaign.

Your first campaign each day (real life calendar day based on the MUD's
time zone) will result in bonus quest points once it is completed. While
redoing a 9th tier, campaign rewards will start to reduce after the first
30 campaigns per day.

Once in a while, you may kill a mob listed as a campaign target and not
receive credit for it.  99% of the time, this is not a bug.  See 'help
mobkeys' for more information.

for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone

Climbing a cold mountain trail
  You are standing on a cold mountain trail. The trail leads upwards in the 
mountain and the cliffs on either side allow you shelter from the winds, 
while you walk along the path. The rocks are covered with ice, creating a 
hazardous surface to walk up. Best to walk carefully.

The hazardous path
  This mountain trail continues to the north. It is covered in snow and ice, 
making it unsafe to walk along for the unwary. The cliff walls rise to either
side, and are so steep that you cannot climb them. Large rocks litter the 
ground from where they fell overhead.

Climbing the snowy mountain
  This section of the trail is covered with a deep snow, making it difficult to
walk. The snow is a pure white, except for a yellow patch to the north. It 
might be best to avoid that snow. The trail seems to end here, but if you 
climb up the trail continues there.

cabin. Some smoke drifts from the cabin, ensuring that a warm fire is lit.

The twin pines
  You are standing before a tall pine tree. Legend has it that this tree was 
planted with its twin to celebrate the life and love of Rythemus and Lantana.
They died tragically in this spot. Upon their death the land grew cold and 
barren. Their friend, Thylinimus, planted these two trees as a memorial, and 
the trees immediately began to grow. These two trees still survive as a 
symbol of their love and devotion to each other - one of the signs of hope on
this desolate tundra.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

It's a narrow alley, and nobody seems to care that trash chokes it now and

alive.  For this is one of the favorite haunts for muggers and those looking
to spill a little blood just for fun, and every being that walks through is
careful to keep a weapon close at hand.

Deception Boulevard
  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of

A Barren Wasteland

The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

The Iron Maiden (G)
  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium

the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur

alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris.  Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur is
never eliminated completely.

  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Iron Maiden (G)
  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

M'mog's Tavern [**> PK <**]
  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

Help Keywords : Graffiti.
Help Category : Miscellaneous.

Last Updated  : 2023-01-28 13:14:46.

Syntax: graffiti add <message>   Adds graffiti to a room (199 char max)
        graffiti perm <message>  Writes permanent message (can't be cleared)
        graffiti clear           Removes non-permanent graffiti
        graffiti clear clanpays  Removes clan hall graffiti (leader only)

Graffiti allows you to leave a hidden message in a room that other players
may find later.  Rooms with graffiti will have a (G) appended to the end of
the room name (e.g., 'Center Square (G)'.  Simply 'look graffiti' to see the
message and its author.

Adding graffiti to a room that does not already have graffiti costs two
trivia points and is done via 'graffiti add <message>'.  Only one message 
may exist in a room at one time.

To remove existing graffiti in a room, type 'graffiti clear'.  This costs
4 trivia points.  Alternatively, a clan leader may use the clan account to
remove graffiti in their own clan hall.  This costs 300 quest points from
the clan account. Permanent graffiti cannot be removed via 'graffiti clear'
but costs 6 trivia points to add.

Graffiti that is over a year old becomes permanent and cannot be removed.
This does not apply to clan halls using the 'clanpays' option.  If you
feel that there is a special exception, contact an imm to have the graffiti
removed manually.


Please do not leave graffiti with swearing and/or direct personal attacks 
on other characters in the game. At the very least, it will simply be 
cleared and you will have wasted your trivia points.

Note: Please report to immortal staff if you find offensive graffiti
in any language (with translation if not English).

alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium

the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of

alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the

the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur
is never eliminated completely.

  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

The Iron Maiden (G)
  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

A Damned soul slinks along warily.
Lord Mulciber relaxes, drinking a cup of the finest blackwine.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Cathedral
  Planed wooden floors.  Pews.  An altar.  Stained glass windows. 
Everything a cathedral should be, even if this is an odd place to find one. 
But the Church of Free Will is strong in the city, despite the strange fact
that a Damned leads it.  There are those who whisper and mutter about it,
but never where they can be overheard.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Bottomless Chasm (G)
  There's literally no end to this chasm.  A falling being will never hit
bottom- kind of a mixed blessing- and the canyon continues in a perfect
circle around Pandemonium City.  Even those who can fly have trouble here,
battered and tossed about by stinking, gale force winds.  Were it not for
the bridge above, the City would be almost impossible to reach.

  A place of relative safety?  Perhaps.  Certainly there's less tension in
the air here, and laughter can actually be detected.  It's a fairly
decent-sized cave, and some effort has been made to provide a measure of
comfort.  Rickety chairs, a few tables, and even piles of blankets are
available for those able to escape the Warren for at least a few minutes.

  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Deception Boulevard
  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur
is never eliminated completely.

M'mog's Tavern [**> PK <**]
  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

M'mog's Tavern [**> PK <**]
  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

Syntax: prompt                : Toggles prompt display.
        prompt all            : Resets prompt to hp/mana/moves/tnl format.
        prompt <variables>    : Creates custom prompt from given variables.
        bprompt <variables>   : Sets battle prompt visible while fighting.
        p data                : Show prompt data.

'prompt' with no arguments will turn your prompt on and off.  'prompt all'
will reset your prompt to the default "hp mana moves tnl" prompt.

Use 'prompt' with a combination of the following to set up a custom prompt.
For example, "prompt %hhp %mmn %vmv qt%q>" will show "10hp 10mn 10mv qt0>"
as your prompt.  Color codes ('help color') may be used in prompts; adding
@w to the beginning of your prompt can help prevent color bleeding.

You may also use 'bprompt' to set a separate battle prompt with different
data, which will show while engaged in combat.

'config' will display your current prompt and bprompt strings.  If you are
idle, your regular prompt will change to "Idle" until you return; see
'help newprompt').

Some prompt variables include additional formatting, shown in quotes.

  A high class establishment, the Iron Maiden is -the- place to be seen for
aspiring demons.  Nobles frequent the place, and often reserve it for their
private parties.  Damned servants scurry to serve the patrons, and woe
betide one that drops a drink.  They usually end up on the menu.  It tends
to lend an even darker atmosphere to the dimly lit club, as they move among
clusters of tables and dodge those dancing to the wailing, discordant music.

  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

The Twisting Gates
  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the
tallest demon.  One might guess they're made of some metal, to judge from
the rust, except that metal doesn't normally twist and bend as if in pain. 
They must be the source of the low moans filtering through the hot air.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

The Plaza Gates
  Almost as formidable as the gates at the City's entrance, these protect
Pandemonium's nobility from invasion of their elite sanctum.  The road
slopes upward sharply, as if discouraging would-be treaders, and the City
Guard stationed at the gate itself looks none too friendly.

Everything a cathedral should be, even if this is an odd place to find one. 
But the Church of Free Will is strong in the city, despite the strange fact
that a Damned leads it.  There are those who whisper and mutter about it,

Deception Boulevard
  Traffic picks up quite a bit on this broad avenue.  Demons and Damned
alike move purposefully on their way to and from the market and Pandemonium
City's most popular tavern.  The biggest danger here is usually the
pickpockets that work the crowds.  Those who dare to leave trash here run
the risk of annoying the City Guards, so the road tends to be clear of
debris. Somehow even the air seems cleaner, though the odor of sulphur
is never eliminated completely.

M'mog's Tavern [**> PK <**]
  Raucous laughter spills from this dimly lit tavern into the street
outside.  There's no proper door leading into the place, just a hole in the
wall, and those entering are neatly framed against the crimson light
outside.  A number of tables are available, all frozen and molded in various
entertaining shapes from hapless Damned.  Demons are allowed on the
furniture.  Damned have to be content with occupying a mucky pit in the
corner.  Business is good, and M'mog has hired a number of imps to serve his
customers.  The patrons tend to treat the staff well, lest their drinks
be...  altered.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

Malice Bridge
  Crossing a vast chasm several miles across, this bridge is wide enough
for an army to march across without crowding.  Carved from the very stone
thrusting out from the ground, it needs no extraneous support structure. 
Still, a look over the side into the bottomless canyon below is enough to
induce vertigo and fervent hopes for the span's continued stability.

Garien's Hideaway
  Definitely not much to look at, this one-room shack is nonetheless
typical of the dwellings squabbled over in the Warren.  With a roof so low
one has to duck to enter, and only some ragged blankets to provide comfort,
it does have one precious advantage- it's a place to hide from those that
would do its occupant harm.  And there are many, many of those.

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  The bricks lining the ground are perfect, with no chinks or cracks. 
The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,
the stains wash away easily.

The Royal Plaza
  The peak of the city, in more ways than one.  Grand palaces sprawl in all
directions, each the home of a demon Prince.  Entering those residences
without invitation is probably a bad idea, and this is emphasized by the
soldiers that almost outnumber the crowds of demons moving through the long
plaza.  To the north is the grandest castle of all- that owned by the King
himself, and from which he administers the land.

The Court of the King
  Oddly, perhaps, this is the most peaceful place in all of Pandemonium. 
Unlike some courts, in which nobles and citizens alike do not hesitate to
scream out their opinions and protests, King Lucifer's is maintained with
quiet decorum.  This probably has something to do with the fact that
violators of this rule are likely to find their heads on a spike.  Even
honor combat is forbidden in this grand hall built of simple stone and wood.
The King and his Princes each have a permanent throne here, around which are
usually clustered petitioners.  Lucifer's, of course, towers over the rest,
though the statues carved of stone, each depicting one of those nobles, are
more colossal than anything most demons and Damned ever hope to see.

  Brave you are indeed, to venture so far into the home of the King.
Perhaps it's quite understandable fear that keeps most out, though not even
a single guard is posted at the stone stairs that curl their spiral way
upwards. The walls are damp and cool, and the observant might notice
rivulets of... you hope that's water, though it's rather dark... converging
and draining into the grate at the middle of the floor. It's also through
that grate that muffled screams become quite clear, sending a shiver along
listeners' spines.

Syntax: graffiti add <message>   Adds graffiti to a room (199 char max)
        graffiti perm <message>  Writes permanent message (can't be cleared)
        graffiti clear           Removes non-permanent graffiti
        graffiti clear clanpays  Removes clan hall graffiti (leader only)

Graffiti allows you to leave a hidden message in a room that other players
may find later.  Rooms with graffiti will have a (G) appended to the end of
the room name (e.g., 'Center Square (G)'.  Simply 'look graffiti' to see the
message and its author.

Adding graffiti to a room that does not already have graffiti costs two
trivia points and is done via 'graffiti add <message>'.  Only one message 
may exist in a room at one time.

To remove existing graffiti in a room, type 'graffiti clear'.  This costs
4 trivia points.  Alternatively, a clan leader may use the clan account to
remove graffiti in their own clan hall.  This costs 300 quest points from
the clan account. Permanent graffiti cannot be removed via 'graffiti clear'
but costs 6 trivia points to add.

Graffiti that is over a year old becomes permanent and cannot be removed.
This does not apply to clan halls using the 'clanpays' option.  If you
feel that there is a special exception, contact an imm to have the graffiti
removed manually.


Please do not leave graffiti with swearing and/or direct personal attacks 
on other characters in the game. At the very least, it will simply be 
cleared and you will have wasted your trivia points.

Note: Please report to immortal staff if you find offensive graffiti
in any language (with translation if not English).

A Cell
  Barely seven feet by seven feet in dimension, this is definitely a
punishment in and of itself.  Most demons would have to curl up to reside
within a cell like this.  Then there's the shackles that are here to twist
bodies into uncomfortable positions, preventing rest.  The room is bare,
without even a blanket to provide a measure of comfort.  Gleaming eyes and
chittering noises from behind cracked bricks speak of creatures that will
happily visit to feed once the occupant is asleep.

The Dungeons of the Iron Order (G)
  It's pretty much everything one would expect from a dungeon.  A single
exit.  Instruments of torture.  The floor permanently stained dark red with
spilled blood.  The sound of screams, and begging for mercy, and the odor of
despair.

The Depths of Behemoth Castle
  Brave you are indeed, to venture so far into the home of the King.
Perhaps it's quite understandable fear that keeps most out, though not even
a single guard is posted at the stone stairs that curl their spiral way
upwards. The walls are damp and cool, and the observant might notice
rivulets of... you hope that's water, though it's rather dark... converging
and draining into the grate at the middle of the floor. It's also through
that grate that muffled screams become quite clear, sending a shiver along
listeners' spines.

The Court of the King
  Oddly, perhaps, this is the most peaceful place in all of Pandemonium. 
Unlike some courts, in which nobles and citizens alike do not hesitate to
scream out their opinions and protests, King Lucifer's is maintained with
quiet decorum.  This probably has something to do with the fact that
violators of this rule are likely to find their heads on a spike.  Even
honor combat is forbidden in this grand hall built of simple stone and wood.
The King and his Princes each have a permanent throne here, around which are
usually clustered petitioners.  Lucifer's, of course, towers over the rest,
though the statues carved of stone, each depicting one of those nobles, are
more colossal than anything most demons and Damned ever hope to see.

hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the

  Aaaaah.  The field waving in the wind relaxes you.  You could stay here
all day.  To the northwest you see a small tool shed, and that odd twister
is still in the northeast.

You look to the east and see the source of the wind: a giant tornado which

  You are between two layers of whirling air.  All around you, dust and
debris fly around.  The winds prevent you from falling down, but refuse to
carry you up farther.  Maybe if you move around this layer a bit you can
find somewhere to go up.

Outside a Small Farmhouse
  You are outside the open door of a country farmhouse.  It is in okay
shape; the paint is peeling but not cracked, and the roof looks old but
sturdy.  Maybe you should go in and see what's cooking.

You look to the east and see the source of the wind: a giant tornado which

A Quiet Meadow
  Soft breezes sway the long grasses invitingly.  A slight scent of seawater
drifts from the north where you can just see a rocky outcropping.  Looking
around, you are slightly puzzled.  To the best of your recollection there
was once a quaint little village here.  A well-trodden path leads north
towards the sound of waves crashing against rocks.  
 
A wooden sign sticks up from the grass.

Overlooking a Newly Formed Sea (G)
  Gazing out, all you see is an endless expanse of water.  Far, far below
the waves crash against jagged slices of shoreline.  A thin stretch of beach
is barely visible at the base of the cliffs, and that might just be another
being standing at the water's edge.  The main path continues on right over
the cliff's edge, as if there used to be land there and a place for the path
to go.  Looking around for a possible way down, you spy a fresh trail
heading off to the east.

  Here the winds are no longer gentle, and you struggle to maintain your
tenuous perch on the edge of the path.  Downward there seems to be a
possible descent, but can those rocks possibly hold your weight?  The form
that you previously glimpsed is much clearer, and you can see that it is,
indeed, a person standing on the beach.  Taking a deep breath, you lower
yourself over the edge, determined to ask of this other what has happened
to the peaceful village that once stood here.

  A shallow ledge allows you to pause to take a deep breath.  Screeching
gulls swoop overhead, cursing your intrusion of their domain.  Your
trembling fingers are torn and bleeding from scrambling for purchase on the
jagged rock.  The winds whip you mercilessly, almost sending you reeling off
of the sheer face.  Looking up, you see that to attempt to return to safer
ground is near to impossible.  Down seems to be the only option.

At the Base of the Cliff
  At last, you place your feet on solid ground.  Looking up, you can hardly
believe that you actually were able to make it down the cliff unscathed. 
The beach stretches out before you, inviting you to stroll along and
discover the local flora and fauna.  Everywhere you see rampant signs of
flourishing life.  Tide pools teem with small, scurrying creatures and
shells glisten in the sunlight.  All in all, it is a rather picturesque
place.  Further ahead you can make out with certainty the form of a little
green man gazing out over the waters.  Maybe now you can finally find out
what has happened here.

Wandering Along the Beach
  The warm sands cushion your steps as you wander closer to the shoreline. 
There seems to be an abundance of life everywhere...  The sands are patterned
with strange, wavering lines, as if something has crawled from the sea to
further up the beach.  All around you are misshapen lumps of sand, and to
the north a large lump seems to be attracting the attention of quite a few
of the gulls.

  Finally, you have reached the water's edge.  Here stands the man you saw
from atop the cliffs.  What is this that he has handed you?  His gaze turns
back out to the turbulent sea, his face sinking into an expression of deep
sadness.  Looking past him, you see a drop off in the shoreline.  There is a
faint luminescence in the water, almost as if a path has been outlined on
the sea's floor.  Perhaps a closer look is worthwhile.

glimmers.  Down below, the glow that you saw from the shore seems to lead
you even deeper into this unknown realm.  The choice is yours: retreat, or
continue your adventure?

  Dimly lit, this space is close and cramped.  The ceiling seems to press
down upon you.  Reaching up, you feel something odd.  It is a smooth surface,
with what might be a clasp or lock of some kind.  Peering through the murky
darkness, you realize that this is another house, again strangely intact. 
However, whatever force brought this house here hasn't left it unscathed. 
It is actually upside down, lodged between two rocks!  Perhaps you can

  Here, the dim light that has guided your path coalesces into one
brilliant pinpoint.  The entire area seems to almost throb with otherworldly
phosphorescence.  Looking closely, you can see that in the midst of all this

that blocks the path.  Strange ciphers are etched into the rock's surface. 
Could they be the key to continuing on your adventure?

However, whatever force brought this house here hasn't left it unscathed. 
It is actually upside down, lodged between two rocks!  Perhaps you can

  What a mess!  Sloughed off skins line the floor of this cave, and there
is a definite odor of sock permeating the air.  The inhabitants are jovially
passing about a flask filled with some kind of rancid brew.  Guess you only
have two choices here...  Join in and forget about the sad-eyed Wooble
counting on you, or journey on and save your gut from some virulent malaise.

Deep in the Coral
  The coral walls close in around you as you travel deeper into this
realm of sea snakes.  Luckily, you are able to use these same walls
to keep yourself from being swept away by the current.  To the west
you can see another cave.  A quick push in that direction should be
enough to get you out of the rush of water.  As you brace to shove
off, you feel a give in the opposite wall.

  All around you a reef comprised of coral spreads along the sea's bottom. 
Here you can see that a path has been cleared.  It is strangely meandering,
however, as if the creator were incapable of forging a straight line. 
Looking around you, it seems fairly obvious that the creatures here with
you are more than likely the culprits.

Deep in the Coral
  The waters finally calm, and you are able to stand almost upright and
survey your surroundings.  The reef begins to slant upwards to your left,
clearly opening to a larger chamber.  There are small caves ahead and to
the right of you.

Deep in the Coral
  The coral walls close in around you as you travel deeper into this
realm of sea snakes.  Luckily, you are able to use these same walls
to keep yourself from being swept away by the current.  To the west
you can see another cave.  A quick push in that direction should be
enough to get you out of the rush of water.  As you brace to shove
off, you feel a give in the opposite wall.
 
Is that a sign hidden in the coral?

  Here, the walls rise high overhead.  The water rushes in from behind you,
trying to push you farther along.  Grabbing onto a jutting wall, you pause
to get your bearings.  To your left you can see a small cave, virtually
undetectable without close examination.  To the north, the coral closes in
again, with barely enough room for you to pass.

  Everywhere you look, the denizens of this land slither along.  The coral
looms over you, trapping you in the murky depths.  Perhaps this quest is
destined to be ill-fated.  Feeling as if failure is predestined, you
suddenly notice something that quickens your pulse.  There, against the
far wall!  It's an arrow, directing you to continue on to the north;
finally, a sign that you are heading along the correct path.

The Beginning of a Coral Reef
  All around you a reef comprised of coral spreads along the sea's bottom. 
Here you can see that a path has been cleared.  It is strangely meandering,
however, as if the creator were incapable of forging a straight line. 
Looking around you, it seems fairly obvious that the creatures here with
you are more than likely the culprits.

The Grand Plaza (G) (1321)

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Outside the East Gate
  You are on a small dirt path outside the east gate of a village.  The
path seems infrequently used and disappears into the undergrowth ahead.  You
can hear the sounds of a stream to the west.  The trees in this part of the
forest seem to be evergreens: pine and spruces and firs.

Inside the East Gate
  You are inside the east gate of Cradlebrook.  People hurry along the
road, eager to get to their destinations.  The road within the village is
well-used, despite the poor trails outside - it seems the villagers like
to keep to themselves.  The walls of the village surround you to the
south, and the east gate is open.  To the west the cobbled street
continues.

The Creek in the Village
  You stand in the cold waters of Last Mountain Creek.  It runs north, where
further down a bridge has been built.  You can see several villagers drawing
water in small wooden buckets, and more than one person sits on the banks with
line and lure, looking to catch a fish.  There is a wide roadway to the east,
and a slightly smaller one to the west.

A Small Road in Cradlebrook
  You are standing on a small cobblestone road.  This section of the village

  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

>>    Inside Sargasso's gate
  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

Approaching a small mine shaft
  After having spent some time in the dirty, run down settlement of
Sargasso, you realize that the only thing the prospectors have is mining. 
They left their families and decided to dedicate themselves to one single
task.  The wind starts to pick up a little and the weird dirt-stuff flies
around for a little bit, but the gusts are not nearly as horrible as when
you were walking upon the mountain.  Still, the smell of charred flesh,
which was absent to the north, lingers on here.  What could these miners be
doing to paint such a horrid picture of the town?  You shrug off the
question, thinking it could not possibly be on purpose.  To the west you see
a beautifully colored hut and wonder why something so vibrant would be in a
place of such death and misery.

>>    Inside a small mine shaft
  Rotting oak posts support the ceiling of this very old looking mine
shaft.  You find this to be very strange, because all the other clues point
to the fact that Sargasso is a relatively new settlement.  How odd.  Maybe
there's something more to the mineshaft ...  something beautiful, yet
forgotten for countless ages.  The upper level of the mine shaft continues
south of here, or you can explore the depths of the mine below.

Exploring underground
  This mine shaft is certainly much bigger than you thought it would be! 
It appears that the Sargasso miners certainly found a bit more than ore when
they dug deep inside the ground.  The underground caverns seem almost
endless, and you can't help but notice that they seem to be very ancient,
unlike the relatively new mine shaft.  You can climb back up the rope to the
mining settlement, but you get the feeling that it would be much nicer to
explore underground instead.  Paths spiral off in each direction, and you
really don't know which would be the best way to go.  Tiny little runes are
carved inside one of the cavern's walls in runny black ink.  Maybe coming to
Sargasso wasn't such a huge waste after all.

Exploring underground
  Even though you are still relatively close to the Sargasso mineshaft, you
cannot believe how different this place is from the accursed town.  Whereas
Sargasso had almost nothing but horror and evil, the underground has a
mysterious quality.  You don't know exactly how to catergorize it: sometimes
the cavern gives off a feeling of warmth and light, other times you cringe
in fear, wondering if your own shadow has turned against you.  Bowing your
head slightly, you utter a quick prayer to your god, asking him to protect
you.  The tunnel opens up into a huge chamber here, and by the way the dust
flies around the opening you can tell that some entity passed through here
quite recently.

  The intersection of King's Street and Griffon Street is a huge square 
surrounded by shops and homes. Canopies cover the doors and windows of the 
shops, protecting their customers from any poor weather. Scents of cooking 
fill the air, and the noise of the crowds shopping and talking fill the air.
A large fountain in the middle of the square squirts water high into the air.
The fountain depicts a boy shooting an arrow into the sky, but instead of an 
arrow water squirts out. A large grate on the street is used for the city's 
sewage, and an odor rises from it. King's Street continues to the north and 
south, while Griffon Street runs to the east and west.

  The drawbridge is a huge wooden gate, and currently it is down allowing free 
passage into the castle. Huge chains are attached to both sides of it, and 
extend to the walls to the south. Large shadows swim in the moat below. As 
you are looking down, a leaf falls into the moat. As soon as the leaf hits 
the water, a flurry of teeth and claws crashes together in that location.
Make sure you don't fall in.

Syntax: skills ((<from level> <to level>) (<filter>) | all)
        spells ((<from level> <to level>) (<filter>) | all)

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list of
available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in order
of level.  The practiced percentage is listed, as well as the spell number
(see 'help cast') and casting cost for spells.

Without a level range, these commands will show all abilities from level 1
to your current level.  Specifying a range will show all skills/spells for
the given range.  Forgotten Skills or spells (see 'help forgetskill') are
not displayed unless the 'all' option is used.

You may also use any of the following filters for these commands:

    Affected   - abilities currently affecting you
    Area       - abilities that target an entire room
    Attack     - abilities that add an additional attack to combat
    Bad        - abilities that cause a bad affect on the target
    Combat     - combat-based abilities
    Curative   - abilities that remove bad affects
    Dodge      - the basic dodge abilities
    Healing    - abilities that heal, or affect healing
    Learned    - abilities that have been practiced above 1%
    Movement   - abilities that transport you or others
    Nofail     - all nofail abilities (see 'help nofail')
    Object     - abilities that are used on objects
    Other      - abilities that can be used on others
    Passive    - abilities that are used automatically
    Pets       - abilities that create or control pets
    Resist     - abilities that add resistances
    Spellup    - beneficial abilities
    <Stat>     - abilities that give a bonus to the given stat
    <Damtype>  - any damage type such as 'fire' - see 'help damtypes'
    Stats      - abilities that add any stats
    Unaffected - abilities that are currently NOT affecting you
    Weapon     - weapon skills

Before the entrance to the Underdark
  You stand before a huge door.  The corridor can easily fit fifteen humans
standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

Stone Archway
  A chilled breeze rushes through the dark, rough-hewn cavern. The walls are 
covered in scripts and glyphs, visible through an eerie glow that barely 
penetrates the darkness. Broken planks and discarded potion bottles litter 
the floor and a sign of some sort is engraved with a message.

  There is no visible light source in the cavern.  Even light brought in

  All that can be seen through the haze of smoke are bodies upon bodies of
people attempting to get to a seat, a drink, a dancer, or all the above. 
People jostle against one another, sometimes by accident, other times on
purpose.  One seat appears to open and several patrons try to be the first
to get to it.  Beneath the feet of the crowd is a floor so incredibly
sticky, as though large spiders had spun a web upon the rocks.  The constant
shoving and pushing through this portion of the club is intense, causing
some patrons to try slinking along the walls.  To one side, someone
discovers their coin purse is missing, and a forlorn cry of sorrow can be heard
over the din.

lines the back of the bar, but it is almost too smoky to see clearly.  Empty
ale casks serve as seats around the edge of the bar.

The Bartender seems busy tonight.
A guard with entirely too much muscle watches every move made by those around him.

  Stained rugs lie on the floor in front of this stage, providing a bit of
home-style comfort against the cold stones.  The pulsating music seems a bit
faded in this room, and the crowd seems a lot more settled.  The smokiness
provides a heavy cover, shielding the patrons from each other.

  Bean bags in red, yellow, green, and orange are piled along the floor.  A
few patrons, some singles, some couples, take a bit of time to snuggle
and talk about some of the sights they are taking in.  One patron appears to
be almost asleep.  Soft, excited sounds emanate from behind one of the bags.
A loud gasp, followed by a giggle, then silence resumes.  It doesn't take
much to realize just how depraved this area truly is.

Guards
  Suddenly, penetrating the smell of sweat, something even more dank fills
the air.  Small three-toed footprints can be found in the dust over the
flagstones alongside large five-toed ones.  A variety of species have
passed through to go down the steps.  Perhaps they knew the secret of the
guards.

A Dusty Stairwell
  A short flight of flagstone stairs end here in a dusty stairwell. Garbled 
voices, music and the pounding of feet come from above. The steps are covered
in a thin layer of stone dust, and upon closer inspection, reveals cloven 
hoofprints of some kind. The stairs lead upwards, and there is a short 
passageway and a door to the south.

  Another room which has the air of enforcement about it, this dimly lit
place leaves the scent of sweat heavy in the nostrils.  Dark red stains on
the walls and floors leave no doubt that this is a place where one's guard
should never be let down.  The sounds here are more subdued, having left the
hectic market and other distractions above.  Serious business is
accomplished in these halls, and there is no doubt as to the penalty for
causing mischief.

  A small fire ahead lights the room warmly.  There appears to be a stone
counter and a scratched and stained stool behind it, but no one to help run
the place.  A glass block in the counter allows the viewing of various
scrolls.  Unlike the usual scrolls one sees, these are stained black with
red writing and are burned at the edges.  A small sign says "Buyer Beware -

  The cavern walls are narrow here, with barely room to move forward or

silence.  A decision must be made: to continue west, into the deepest depths

nothing.  A thin tongue flicks rapidly from his mouth, evoking fear and

Shifting air currents
  Suddenly the air takes on a different feel.  It seems to shimmer, and
reflect light differently, blurring the edges of vision slightly.  Colors
seem to blend together a little more, making shapes appear indistinct. 
Faintly, the sound of fizzling or buzzing can be heard in the air, almost as
though an insect swarm is flying nearby.  It's obvious that there are
powerful magics cast about here, and wisdom dictates even more caution than
it's taken to make it this far!

  There is a great deal of evidence in this room indicating it is used for

mind-numbingly unbearable.  Portions of bodies, many of which are

Gilded hallway
  This hallway is decorated more nicely than what has been seen so far.  It
appears that beyond here, for those who make it, is where the priciest of
transactions take place.  Slaves whose sole purpose in this world is to keep
this hallway clean spend hours on their knees, scrubbing every inch of
floor.  There are slits within the wall, designed to be money-drops for
large sums of cash.  It's obvious a large amount of money makes its way
through here daily.

delicate nature.  If you want someone to do your work for you, your bidding,

heard, but to the south, wild pleading and crying in various tones can be

bright and light still.  A choice needs to be made, and only one person can
make it.

often showing moral fortitude and kind philanthropy, those in the know
recognize in the Boss a scoundrel who lies and cheats with the best of them.

Split in the cave
  This portion of the cave is kept very neat.  The pathway through the
treasures is wide and level, while the stacks are extremely neat, much more
so than any other portion of this cave.  The dust becomes a problem for
sinuses here, as there is not a chance for it to settle on the objects, so
it has no place else to go.  A dull glow is coming from the west,
accompanied by the faint sound of ticking.

On the murky river
  You are carried along slowly by the flow of this muddy river.  Huge trees
grow along the banks, vines and ferns dripping from their branches. 
Colorful birds dart overhead, chasing the clouds of droning insects.

In a Field
  It is humid here, close to the river.  This field is crowded with very
tall grasses, each having a bamboo-like stem.  The breeze rustles through the
narrow, sword-shaped leaves.  Insects buzz around the sweet sap oozing from
a cut plant.  Tasting the sap yourself, you realize you are in a field of
sugarcane.

     This sugar cane is leaking sweet sap.

On the Ocean Floor
  Resting your feet against the ocean floor, you stop and realize that you
do not feel the intense pressure you thought you might at this depth.  You
can move about with relative ease, almost as if on surface.  While relaxing
to strained muscles after the long swim, it is also a curious sensation. 
Looking around in an attempt to survey the vista before you, a dark shadow
of movement above causes you to grasp your weapon just a little more
tightly.  What strange new world have you entered, and are you welcome?

Before the Great Coral Tower
  The Great Coral Tower rises from the sands in a gigantic pinnacle. 
Sharkonian guards protect the entranceway.  Other Sharkonians go in and out
of the building.  Even though there are no markings or ornaments to denote
rank, the reactions of the guards show that the beings entering and leaving
this Tower are the most powerful in this realm.

The Throne Room of the Sharkatan Royals
  The room seems to go on forever in its expansiveness.  Guards line the
Throne Room, their presence felt, but barely noticable.  You are instead
drawn to the large and impressive throne at the room's end.  You feel tiny
and insignificant in the room, and feel yourself almost cowering at the
power emanating from the Lord of Sharkatan who oversees his Kingdom from
this room.

A great hall
  As you pass through a painted ceiling you emerge into a great hall.  
The tiles on the floor seem to make a pattern of some sort but the 
dust makes it hard to see.  Large Ionic pillars line the east and 
west walls of this room.  The southern wall is buried under dirt and 
rocks.  You see a faint light coming from an alcove to the north.  It 
adds an eerie glow to the room.

the opening illuminating what appears to be mason work.  Looking in,

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to

enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since the beginning of time have the light and dark forces been battling. Many
years have passed and nobody is quite sure why anymore. The light side blames
the dark for their evil ways and uncaring attitudes. The dark side blames the
light for their easy going, happy go-lucky ways. Only one person that can truly
sort all this out. Malcrom has been trying to determine who is truly to blame 
for centuries. All he lacks is the stories from each side, for, he is stuck in
the clouds and cannot retrieve the stories from each side. Once he gets both 
sides of the story, surely, he will be able to figure out who started this all.

  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its
walls are lined by smaller pillars that you saw in the hall.  In the center

faint light.

 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."

a great citadel.  The beginning of a wicked looking labyrinth looms

reach your ears.  Beyond the labyrinth you can see the tower that 
must hold something of value to have such evil sounding creatures 
guarding it.

A crack in the valley floor
  The valley you travel through is marred by an opening caused by a
recent earthquake.  The sun casts trails of light that reach deep in
the opening illuminating what appears to be mason work.  Looking in,
you can see that the sides of the crevasse form a rough staircase 
leading into the gloom.

The crevasse
  Climbing down the crevasse you are plagued by aftershocks that cause you
to lose your grip.  With each move you set loose rocks tumbling down letting
you know how far you would fall.  Your light begins to illuminate what seems

A great hall
  As you pass through a painted ceiling you emerge into a great hall.  
The tiles on the floor seem to make a pattern of some sort but the 
dust makes it hard to see.  Large Ionic pillars line the east and 
west walls of this room.  The southern wall is buried under dirt and 
rocks.  You see a faint light coming from an alcove to the north.  It 
adds an eerie glow to the room.

  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its
walls are lined by smaller pillars that you saw in the hall.  In the center
there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.  

[ Exits: south ]
(White Aura) A cracked statue is placed here giving off an eerie glow.
A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

The lightside of the coin
  Staring out across the edge of the citadel you can see the land of
Aardwolf whisking by.  You can hear the joy and feel the warmth from within
the small town that lies to the north.  Looking up into the clouds, past the
city, you see the goal of this journey.  Somewhere in that tower lies the
relic you seek.

The main street
  You are greeted by the sound of a cart coming to a halt on a cobblestone
street.  This seems like a thing from one of those sickening faerie tales:
everyone getting along, smiling, and helping each other.  Hopefully you will
not have to put up with this sickening place much longer.

  Centaur children who are frolicking and having a great deal of fun
inhabit the southern part of the square.  A few trees are here granting
shade to all those who wish to spend the day relaxing on the grass.  A

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

A crack in the valley floor
  The valley you travel through is marred by an opening caused by a
recent earthquake.  The sun casts trails of light that reach deep in
the opening illuminating what appears to be mason work.  Looking in,
you can see that the sides of the crevasse form a rough staircase 
leading into the gloom.

  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its

there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.

A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

  You open your eyes and see you are above the clouds at the base of 
a great citadel.  The beginning of a wicked looking labyrinth looms

must hold something of value to have such evil sounding creatures 
guarding it.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of

faint light.

A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

  After finally escaping the labyrinth you stop to catch your breath.  So
far, you are still alive and have high hopes of surviving.  The crawl space
you find yourself in has many odd shaped holes in the floor.  With the right
timing you might be able to drop an object and have it land near a friend as
the citadel passes by.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

At the Town Gates of Dharivian
  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

  The labyrinth continues.  Adventurers seeking to escape from the Queen's
maze may have considered that freezing the imprisoning hedges might make
them breakable.  Guess again.  Icicles hang from the shrubbery branches, and
the deathberries are coated with a fine misting of frost.  The temperature
here definitely dips into an uncomfortable zone, but the hedge branches
remain as hard as iron.  Things may be more comfortable to the south or
west, if one ignores the snarls and growls that can be heard.

punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered

A Crack in the Rock
  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.

turn and flee from that which lies below.  It seems you may continue a ways
further to the south, but the path does not look promising.

  The lava continues thick and red.  Occasionally you run across a minor
monstrosity absorbed in a search for jewels.  Most would seem to be some
variation of kobold.  They seem harmless enough, and too small to dislodge
the most extravagant prospects that glitter insolently in the lava.

except for the way you came in.  Still, it is drafty.  Do you catch a scent

Ravine of Skulls [**> PK <**]
  Descending even deeper into this dark realm, you find yourself in a
narrow ravine with high rock walls.  The ground is littered with ugly oblong
skulls.  No armor is to be seen, so perhaps they were a primitive race. 
Despite the bleakness of the ravine, the mineral richness you encounter
continues to dazzle you.  Large green emeralds sparkle in the obsidian-like
rock that surrounds you.  Threading your way through pits of quicksand, you
see a trail leading south.

An Amethyst Sea (G)
  You now float deep in a strange sea that sparkles as if it were made of
liquid amethyst.  Perhaps it is no more than a drop distilled from the magic
of Zangar.  In any case, you are in it, and rather lost.  All is flux and
convolution.  Strange sea creatures come and go, and what first appear to be
sedentary clams scramble about when you take your eyes off of them.

  You now float deep in a strange sea that sparkles as if it were made of
liquid amethyst.  Perhaps it is no more than a drop distilled from the magic
of Zangar.  In any case, you are in it, and rather lost.  All is flux and

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Outside the Aylorian Academy (G)
  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but

through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.

Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

  The walls and ceiling of this saloon are made of a sturdy canvas-like 
material held aloft by a wooden framework that gives the large tent its

are made of a crudely cut dark wood that gives the saloon a utilitarian 
feeling. Along the west wall is a bar made of the same wood as the chairs and
tables, but the surface has been smoothed and polished. Behind the bar are 
shelves with bottles of various alcoholic liquids, and a keg of beer sits on 
the floor underneath the shelves. Small stacks of semi-clean shot glasses are
at both ends of the bar, and cheap pewter mugs for the beer sit on a shelf 
above the keg. The only illumination is provided by dirty hanging oil 
lanterns that swing lazily from the breeze that blows in from the opening.

Wandering along a dirt path
  You continue along the dirt path in western Sargasso, and the random
arrangement of tents continues all around you.  The settlement wall (if you
can call it that) lies a little ways to the north, but there are so many
rocks in the way that proceeding farther in that direction would be
impossible.  The wind picks up again and you choke and gag as you inhale
some of the horrid dust-stuff.  Muttering something about stupid mining
settlements, you decide to put up with the wind and simply press onwards. 
The large tent to the west looks rather safe compared with the hot wind and
dust you have to deal with outside.

bearskin rug is on the floor, as is a tiny metal box.  No one seems to be
inside this humble abode - it's probably a miner's tent, and odds are he's
off working in the mine.  Other than those two objects, there seems to be
little of value in the house.  You make a mental note never to decorate YOUR
house this poorly.

Wandering along a dirt path
  You continue along the dirt path in western Sargasso, and the random
arrangement of tents continues all around you.  The settlement wall (if you
can call it that) lies a little ways to the north, but there are so many
rocks in the way that proceeding farther in that direction would be
impossible.  The wind picks up again and you choke and gag as you inhale
some of the horrid dust-stuff.  Muttering something about stupid mining
settlements, you decide to put up with the wind and simply press onwards. 
The large tent to the west looks rather safe compared with the hot wind and
dust you have to deal with outside.

  The dirt path ends rather abruptly, giving way to a wooden structure to
the south.  A large sign rests in front of the iron door, and a tiny
tumbleweed floats across your vision.  You grin nervously as you remember
that if the DIRT of this settlement is weird, then maybe this tumbleweed is
too.  The city wall lies beyond the building to your south, while part of
Sargasso's principal mine shaft is to your east - too bad you can only enter
by going south from the center of town.  A large tent is to your west, while
another, uninhabited one lies south; you get the feeling that the latter
plays a huge role in the safety of the camp.

Inside a large tent
  Compared with the rest of Sargasso, this fairly large tent is organized
and clean, although by no means would it ever win any awards for odor.  It
smells like rotten meat inside, and a careful inspection reveals a dead rat
carcass in one of the corners of the tent.  How utterly sick!  Perhaps this
tent isn't so clean after all.  Shaking your head, you decide to leave the
citizens of Sargasso to their own devices.  Let them wallow in their own
filth.

  The iron door behind you slowly creaks shut, making a horrible grating
sound as the metal scrapes the oak floor.  A pile of very important looking
documents rests below a stone gargoyle-like paperweight.  A birchwood file
cabinet lies in the northeast corner of the room, accumulating dust. 
Evidently, it has not been used in a very long while.  You grimace as you
realize how chaotic the scene is - like everyone else in the town, the
sheriff doesn't seem to care about anyone except himself.  You advance
carefully towards the sheriff's desk, making sure that there are no loose
planks in the floor - if you were to fall through it would be a MASSIVE case
of "I've fallen and I can't get up."  I don't think anyone wants to relive
THAT nightmare again.

  As a grizzled prospector shuffles past you, you notice that he is not in
good health.  In fact, everyone seems to be physically exhausted and
mentally anguished.  All the non-stop mining is what hurts them so much. 
Ripped tents dot the settlement in a very erratic pattern: three are clustered
to the north, then there is a large gap between those and the next tent 300
meters away.  You get the impression that people just don't care anymore!

has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

They left their families and decided to dedicate themselves to one single
task.  The wind starts to pick up a little and the weird dirt-stuff flies

Climbing through the Ice Mist Peaks
  The Ice Mist Peaks are situated on the north east coast of Mesolar.  The
ground is rugged, boulders and craggy peaks make for tough climbing.  Spruce
and pine trees cover the slopes of the mountains and their interlacing
branches block out most of the light.  There is a definite chill in the air,
and icy mist swirls around the peaks.  While there are sounds of life all
around, very few can catch even the faintest glimpse of anything living. 
Moisture drips from the branches of the trees, and the rough ground is
covered in a mixture of damp pine needles and slush.  A winding path lies to
the south, and there seems to be a sense of peace coming from that
direction.  Perhaps it has something to do with the city, just noticeable
in the distance.

Welcome to Aardwolf. May your adventures be mystical, challenging and rewarding.
King's Square
  The intersection of King's Street and Griffon Street is a huge square 
surrounded by shops and homes. Canopies cover the doors and windows of the 
shops, protecting their customers from any poor weather. Scents of cooking 
fill the air, and the noise of the crowds shopping and talking fill the air.
A large fountain in the middle of the square squirts water high into the air.
The fountain depicts a boy shooting an arrow into the sky, but instead of an 
arrow water squirts out. A large grate on the street is used for the city's 
sewage, and an odor rises from it. King's Street continues to the north and 
south, while Griffon Street runs to the east and west.

Griffon Street
  This section of Griffon Street is oddly quiet given the noise from the 
square. The narrow street is illuminated by several balls of light which 
hover in the air. They spin and circle each other as though putting on a show
for anyone watching. Occassionally they disappear into the obscure shop to 
the north.

  The street force you to the left due to the odd placement of the homes, which
leaves several smaller bends and turns in the street. However the street 
generally progresses from the east to west. The buildings also appear to be

direction.

maker. Should all the seals fall, Kingsholm will be at the mercy of its 
enemies. Therefore, each seal is guarded by immortal warriors who will fight 
to the death to protect the seals.

[ Exits: (east) down ]
The guardian of the seals stops you.

Syntax: cast web <target>
Spell Number: 237

Spellcasters and thieves can entangle an opponent in a magical web which
restricts movement and use of portals. The amount of restricted movement 
is based on the strength of the web spell, which can be seen using
'affects'.

The success of a web spell varies depending on the stats of the casters vs
the stats of the target. The stats used, in order of importance, are below:

Attacker: Intelligence, Wisdom, Luck
Target  : Intelligence, Wisdom, Luck, Resistance to Negative, Constitution.

Web can be reduced or removed completely using the 'dissolve' spell.

Instinct is a higher-end Aardwolf game feature that allows players to 
specialize in specific skills and spells. Instinct is very expensive and
can costs hundreds of trains per point depending on stats. This isn't 
quite as bad as it sounds, trains come much more easily when you reach level
201 and build some stats.

Players are allowed to deposit spare unused (not from a rebuild) trains at 
the end of each remort to make them available for instinct.

When we decided to add training sessions to the donation rewards, the main
reason was to help high levels with the instinct costs. We did not want to 
leave lower levels out of the bonus completely but giving a level 50 
character 2500 trains in exchange for a $50 donation would be extremely 
imbalancing.

The compromise we came up with was to give instinct trains. Depending on 
your level these may not be terribly useful right now, but you will 
appreciate them very much as you continue to grow your Aardwolf character.

See 'help instinct' for more information on that feature.

See 'help instinct-trains' for more information on the mechanics of how
regular trains work with instinct.

Syntax: scribe <spell name>

Scribe is a skill which allows you to prepare written scrolls for later use.

To scribe a spell you need to have:

* A blank scroll - available at Mayvor's Mystic Mastery in Aylor city 
  (runto scrolls).
* The ability to cast the scribed spell.
* Enough mana to cover the cost of inscribing the spell which is 4 times 
  the amount of mana require to cast it normally. 

The level of the written spell will be 5 levels below your current level.

Intelligence and luck will help in scribing, particularly once you get to 
the second and third spell on a single scroll.  It takes a high degree of 
mental training to fit multiple spells on a scroll.

Members of the Enchanter subclass have a better chance of scribing scrolls
with multiple spells than other classes.

Primary stat: Intelligence, Wisdom.
Affected by : Luck.

  There is no visible light source in the cavern.  Even light brought in
anticipation of the darkness seems to wither and fail in the curse of this
place.  With every step, the walls seem to shrink in, making the air thick

  There is no visible light source in the cavern.  Even light brought in
anticipation of the darkness seems to wither and fail in the curse of this
place.  With every step, the walls seem to shrink in, making the air thick
and musty.  The sounds here echo all around with no definite source.  
 
            Sounds echo in your ears.....
                  Sounds echo in your mind.....
                        Sounds echo in your imagination.....
 
The ground begins to descend to deeper unseeable depths.

Descending into the Forlorn Cavern
  The walls are tight, not even an arm's length of room.  The ceiling has
sloped low, barely enough room to stand upright.  The air is heavy, thick,
and the grit of this underground deathtrap hangs heavy in the air.  Sounds
continue the assault from all directions.  

        It seems as if all light has been sucked from this room.

  A guard blocks the entry to the Market. What could be sold here that is so

indicates that the items in that direction for sale will be of a more... 
delicate nature.  If you want someone to do your work for you, your bidding,
or anything else you have in mind, that's the place to go.  'Slave labor for
any occasion!' is their slogan.

  Finally, the corridor seems to be ending.  To the south, a rough wood
door marks a change against the cold concrete that surrounds the rest of the

braids twisted in an odd fashion.  There seems to be more tension here than
anywhere else in the area.

notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

>>    *[NOEXP]* The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

>>    *[NOEXP]* The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

>>    *[NOEXP]* North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  At this, the main intersection of the Grand City of Aylor, the road is
shiny and black as if paved with ebony.  The road extends east and west,
reaching across the entire city.  In the center of this large square stands
a black and pink alabaster statue.  Beneath the statue, many solicitors try
to grab the attention of passersby.  To the north is the white marble temple. 
To the south, you gaze upon a large plaza with eight silver spires piercing
the sky.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

A Barren Wasteland
  All you can see, stretching far into the horizon, is a barren wasteland. 
The ground has been leeched of moisture, and is hard as rock underfoot,
laced with infinite cracks.  There's a few stunted trees, but they're
twisted and charred and lack any greenery.  The only anomaly is a narrow
hole in the ground.

Garien's Hideaway
  Definitely not much to look at, this one-room shack is nonetheless
typical of the dwellings squabbled over in the Warren.  With a roof so low
one has to duck to enter, and only some ragged blankets to provide comfort,
it does have one precious advantage- it's a place to hide from those that
would do its occupant harm.  And there are many, many of those.

The only exception is the occasional bloodstain, usually the only thing left
of Damned that enter the plaza without a pass signed by a Prince.  Luckily,

The Court of the King
  Oddly, perhaps, this is the most peaceful place in all of Pandemonium. 
Unlike some courts, in which nobles and citizens alike do not hesitate to
scream out their opinions and protests, King Lucifer's is maintained with
quiet decorum.  This probably has something to do with the fact that
violators of this rule are likely to find their heads on a spike.  Even
honor combat is forbidden in this grand hall built of simple stone and wood.
The King and his Princes each have a permanent throne here, around which are
usually clustered petitioners.  Lucifer's, of course, towers over the rest,
though the statues carved of stone, each depicting one of those nobles, are
more colossal than anything most demons and Damned ever hope to see.

  A place of unsurpassed beauty amid desolation...  The courtyard is filled
with growing things.  Bursts of colorful flowers are carefully tended by the
inhabitants of the Palace of Perfection, and there's even the sweet
titterings of what must be birds that can be found nowhere else in
Pandemonium.  The crystal walls are thickly inlaid with gems and precious
metals, imbuing the courtyard with an irresistable air of grandeur.  Yet,
touching a petal will bring the pain of poison, and the eyes that peep
through the lush greenery accompany the sound of lips being licked in
anticipation...

  Sweet perfume wafts with every movement here, enticing and tantalizing. 
Tasteful artwork, in marble statuary and pastel paintings, are interspersed
with soft couches and tables of pure crystal.  Beautiful beings- Succubi and
Incubi, the children of Princess Lilith- lounge and relax, chatting in quiet
voices.  The Damned that serve them are almost as lovely, and even they are
decked out in silk and jewels.  It is here that the 'cubi are created, and
here they train, hoping to someday earn the title 'Consort' from a demonic
lord.

  Ballroom, receiving hall, and court, all in one.  Every inch of the
marble walls has been covered with carved sheets of extravagantly expensive
dark wood.  The face of Prince Belial himself has been carefully notched
into the ceiling, reminding all those below that they are in his domain. 
The hall is rather large, spacious enough to hold a hundred demons, and only
the finest Damned brick comprises the floor, making sure that footsteps are
quiet and unobtrusive.  Nooks and crannies are provided for those who
require privacy in their conversations, and there is never a lack of the
finest wines and fanciest hors d'oeuvres provided for the guests of the
ruler of Orcus.

Avenue of Greed
  Definitely a better neighborhood, this short avenue is lined with tall
buildings of both the residential and commercial type.  Damned aren't quite
as prevalent here, and those that do wander down the street tend to slink,
hoping to avoid attracting attention.  Of course, the demons continue to
strut proudly.  It's here that the ground is no longer as treacherous
underfoot, and actually well-maintained, if oddly soft, brick.

  Set safely away from the chasm is a pair of gates towering even over the

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

On a jungle path
  A muddy bank leads to a narrow path threading around these huge trees.

On an old bridge
  Here is the most dilapidated bridge you have ever seen!  Its weathered
grey planks are splintered and broken and more than half of them are
missing.  You look over the edge to see the rotting pilings sunk deep into
the mud banks.  Apparently, there is no other way across.  Gathering your
courage, you take one slow, careful step out onto the bridge.  It shudders
and groans under your weight.  I hope you make it across!

Approaching the Camp
  To the northeast, the snow-shrouded bulk of the long dormant volcano
dominates the horizon.  Even at this distance, the fearsome winds of the
upper slopes are made visible through the wisps of snow streaming from the
peak.  There are two constants in this frozen wasteland - the terrible cold,
so intense it easily penetrates clothing, flesh, sinew and bone, and the
wintry landscape, a pallid white as far as the eye can see.  Here and there
a skeletal tree, branches encased in ice, provides some small respite from
the dreary continuity.  A wide swath of snow has been tramped down by the
passing of dozens of booted feet.  It leads off to the east where a camp of
some sort can be seen, a trickle of rising smoke giving evidence of
habitation.

The Human Refugee Camp
  The human occupants of this ramshackle refugee camp consist almost
entirely of children and the elderly.  Those few that are outdoors, braving
the bitter cold, huddle about a small cook fire, arms extended, palms near
the flames.  To the east and south stand the two largest shelters found in
the camp.  With walls of lashed-together sticks and roofs of straw, these
meager structures are little more than hastily constructed huts.  Numerous
bootprints mark the snow, entering the camp from east and continuing on, in
much smaller numbers, to the north.

On a Rugged Trail
  The rocks of the mountain seem to taper off here, although ahead more can
be seen.  The path isn't clear of rocks, but walking is a bit easier at this
point.  In the distance, a snowshoe rabbit can be seen in search for food. 
Although the rabbit blends in very well with the snow, it can be spotted due
to the dark color on the tip of the ears.  Even for the animals that live on
the mountain, food is very scarce.  The humans hunt the rabbits for food,
but due to the quickness of the rabbit, actually killing one for food is
rare.

  The rocks are bigger here than they are lower down the mountainside,
making it harder to navigate.  The rocks are big enough that the only way
across some of them is to climb over them.  The snow on the rocks makes it
very hard to get a good footing on them, thus making it very easy to slip. 
One wrong move could prove to be deadly, sending an adventurer tumbling to
their death on the jagged rocks below.  The climb up the mountain is
dangerous, although many humans have attempted the trek for the legendary
Fire Gem in hopes of bringing warmth back to the outside world.

  Partially covered in bloodstained snow is a half eaten human corpse.  It
is unclear if the human died from the freezing cold of the snow and wind,
and was then eaten, or if some savage animal attacked it and killed it for
food.  Either way, the remains are now frozen in time from the elements of
the severe snow storm.  The body couldn't have been here too awfully long,
as it would be completely covered in snow, or perhaps it has been dug up for
yet another meal before the body completely froze.

of the volcano can be seen in the distance.  The trek has been almost
unbearable.  The journey to the crater is still very dangerous.  Rocks jut
up from the snow - one wrong move could send any adventurer over the edge
to their death.

A light blizzard falls.
A fierce cold wind blows here.
A white ball of feathers is almost indistinguishable amidst the snow.

The Rim of the Crater
  The end of the difficult climb is marked with the rim of a giant crater. 
A tepid breeze blows up from within the volcano, while darkness swirls
around the adventurers who have dared to breach the isolation of the
volcano.  The inner wall of the crater is marked with niches for people to
attempt to climb down.

Within the Crater
  The bottom of the crater is marred by small rocks, large rocks - all
kinds of stones have been scattered around the dusty floor, with some rocks
as large as a small house.  The dust is disturbed by footprints of the
humans who have struggled past, going east and south through the few viable
paths in the rocks.  Creatures laugh at the hapless adventurers from their
safe perch at the rim of the crater, for they know, of those who have gone
down, few have returned intact.

counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door

A Crack in the Rock
  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.  

[ Exits: up down ]
A deathly pale man looks around anxiously.

  Working your way down deeper into the crack, you gain some breathing room

The Crack Continues

you are not in a cavern or grotto.  Might there be inhabitants here?  It is
silent except for the sound of the occasional bat flitting through the
darkness.

Ravine of Skulls [**> PK <**]
  Descending even deeper into this dark realm, you find yourself in a
narrow ravine with high rock walls.  The ground is littered with ugly oblong
skulls.  No armor is to be seen, so perhaps they were a primitive race. 
Despite the bleakness of the ravine, the mineral richness you encounter
continues to dazzle you.  Large green emeralds sparkle in the obsidian-like
rock that surrounds you.  Threading your way through pits of quicksand, you
see a trail leading south.

  More skulls crunch beneath your boots.  More emeralds sparkle in the
gloom.  Occasionally a large bat lurches past, its shrill cry piercing the
silence.  It is so dry and barren here, you feel like you are in an
underground desert.  After a bit, the ravine veers east.

  You continue to descend gradually as you work your way cautiously through
the ravine.  The air seems heavier here, almost liquid, and you suspect that
coal dust from a sinister inferno is wafting into the air.  It is hotter now
and beads of perspiration appear on your brow.

  The ravine comes to an abrupt end.  You peer about looking for some crack

water crashing against rock coming up from below?  An old barrel sits at the

convolution.  Strange sea creatures come and go, and what first appear to be
sedentary clams scramble about when you take your eyes off of them.

Syntax: <automatic>

After time spent training their body and testing it against the rigors
of the world, certain characters become much more hardy. This manifests
itself as an increased ability to recover from injuries, known as fast
healing. With every tick that passes, this ability is checked, and any
benefit passed on to the character. It is possible for this ability to
fail.  This is an automatic skill.

Primary stat: Constitution.
Affected by : None.

An Amethyst Sea
  You now float deep in a strange sea that sparkles as if it were made of
liquid amethyst.  Perhaps it is no more than a drop distilled from the magic
of Zangar.  In any case, you are in it, and rather lost.  All is flux and
convolution.  Strange sea creatures come and go, and what first appear to be
sedentary clams scramble about when you take your eyes off of them.

  Whoosh!  You are sucked up into the tornado.  The prevailing winds are
decidedly in the up direction...  You can't go back down.  Might as well
see what's higher up in the tornado.

  You are between two layers of whirling air.  All around you, dust and
debris fly around.  The winds prevent you from falling down, but refuse to
carry you up farther.  Maybe if you move around this layer a bit you can
find somewhere to go up.

  You are still stuck in this layer of air.  The debris impedes your

higher up in the tornado there and finally find out what's up there.

  It seems as though those winds that brought you here don't want to let
you back down.  Maybe it's a coincidence, or maybe this tornado is magical. 
What if it goes somewhere?  What if you're going somewhere?  Look around
and find out...

shiny and black as if paved with ebony.  The road extends east and west,
reaching across the entire city.  In the center of this large square stands
a black and pink alabaster statue.  Beneath the statue, many solicitors try

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

Shrine to the Emperor
  This is a very historical spot for the people of Kerofk, where the wizard
Rand entered this realm through the 'dimension portal' he made, and later
went on to found this city.  A giant slab of earth lies toppled over here, a
strange eye-shaped stone embedded in it pointing at the sky.  A strange
thrum of power in the background raises your hackles...  Remnants and echoes
of Rand's power, evidently.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ah, Jenny's Tavern.  A wonderful place to go, hang out, have a few too many
ales, and chat with your fellow adventurers.  For years, the owner of the bar
has been in hiding; collecting the money the tavern has generated and hiding
out on an unknown island, living the life of luxury.

That is, until now.  The head chef forgot to freeze last night's chicken, and
in fear of Jenny's wrath due to the loss of revenue, she cooked it anyways, not
caring of the consequences.  Now, everyone in the tavern is sick.  Deathly
sick.  They need your help, and now.  Jenny has come out of hiding, seeking
people to help cure the folks.

Seek Jenny at the entrance of the tavern, if you dare attempt to help the
patrons, possibly putting your own health on the line.

> Say 'lets do this' to Jenny to get back to the goal area.
> You can buy another gas mask from Jenny if you lose yours.

>>    Shrine to the Emperor
  This is a very historical spot for the people of Kerofk, where the wizard
Rand entered this realm through the 'dimension portal' he made, and later
went on to found this city.  A giant slab of earth lies toppled over here, a
strange eye-shaped stone embedded in it pointing at the sky.  A strange
thrum of power in the background raises your hackles...  Remnants and echoes
of Rand's power, evidently.

Shrine to the Emperor
  This is a very historical spot for the people of Kerofk, where the wizard
Rand entered this realm through the 'dimension portal' he made, and later
went on to found this city.  A giant slab of earth lies toppled over here, a
strange eye-shaped stone embedded in it pointing at the sky.  A strange
thrum of power in the background raises your hackles...  Remnants and echoes
of Rand's power, evidently.

                     Goal information for: Jenny's Tavern 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ah, Jenny's Tavern.  A wonderful place to go, hang out, have a few too many
ales, and chat with your fellow adventurers.  For years, the owner of the bar
has been in hiding; collecting the money the tavern has generated and hiding
out on an unknown island, living the life of luxury.

That is, until now.  The head chef forgot to freeze last night's chicken, and
in fear of Jenny's wrath due to the loss of revenue, she cooked it anyways, not
caring of the consequences.  Now, everyone in the tavern is sick.  Deathly
sick.  They need your help, and now.  Jenny has come out of hiding, seeking
people to help cure the folks.

Seek Jenny at the entrance of the tavern, if you dare attempt to help the
patrons, possibly putting your own health on the line.

> Say 'lets do this' to Jenny to get back to the goal area.
> You can buy another gas mask from Jenny if you lose yours.

This spell cannot be cast by a player, but may be found in potions, pills,
scrolls, etc., throughout the realm.

The Black Lotus is an ancient plant that flowers only under the light of a
new moon.  When gathered by silver scythe and specially prepared, a
concoction of this potent brew will restore Mana and Mystical Energy to any
who imbibe it.

Grandmarket Boulevard
  The crowds are loud, rude, obnoxious, and frustrating.  It's amazing what
people will do to find the best deal.  As your journey continues, you begin
to wonder what you are doing here.

  Cages, crates, boxes, and pens clutter the space.  The area is a ruckus
of animal calls, scratching, and yelps.  A large, black spectral caw stands
perched at the entrance, repeatedly crying out, "Pets may bite, watch your
fingers!" as people enter the area.  A bright yellow sign displays
further information regarding purchases.

Welcome to Grandmarket Boulevard! (G)
  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.  

[ Exits: north east south west ]
(White Aura) The local banker, Phreshnar, sits behind a table with a hole in the center.

>>    Whitewind Avenue (G)
  You stand on Whitewind Avenue just south of Grandmarket Boulevard. 
Farther south, Whitewind meets up with Darksoil Path in a soft merging of
roadways.  The road here on Whitewind is as white as snow.  You cannot
imagine the thousands of footsteps that the road has endured, but it seems

  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

'Exotic' is the ability to use items that might not normally be considered
a weapon. The resourceful adventurer can find various ways to inflict pain
on a target using all kinds of common items and some not-so-common items.

Because of the wide variety of possibilities for this weapon type, it is
very difficult to practice and natural proficiency grows more slowly.

Stone Archway
  A chilled breeze rushes through the dark, rough-hewn cavern. The walls are 
covered in scripts and glyphs, visible through an eerie glow that barely 
penetrates the darkness. Broken planks and discarded potion bottles litter 
the floor and a sign of some sort is engraved with a message.

[ Exits: west up ]
A piece of the cavern ceiling crumbles to the ground startling you.

Inside the Archway
  There is no visible light source in the cavern.  Even light brought in
anticipation of the darkness seems to wither and fail in the curse of this
place.  With every step, the walls seem to shrink in, making the air thick
and musty.  The sounds here echo all around with no definite source.  
 
            Sounds echo in your ears.....
                  Sounds echo in your mind.....
                        Sounds echo in your imagination.....
 
The ground begins to descend to deeper unseeable depths.

[ Exits: north east down ]
(Translucent) Within the dark passage, movement briefly catches your eye.

>>    Descending into the Forlorn Cavern
  The walls are tight, not even an arm's length of room.  The ceiling has
sloped low, barely enough room to stand upright.  The air is heavy, thick,
and the grit of this underground deathtrap hangs heavy in the air.  Sounds
continue the assault from all directions.  

        It seems as if all light has been sucked from this room.

A Widening Passage
  A light to the west is a welcome beacon compared with the darkness and
dreariness of the cavern's narrow descent downwards.  The floor of the
cavern slopes gently towards the light, and the echoing sounds now seem
livelier, and more distinct.  
 
The passage continues west and east.

[ Exits: east west ]
A guard roams through the bazaar, looking for anyone out of line.

  A guard blocks the entry to the Market. What could be sold here that is so 
shady an armed guard must stand watch? The sounds of haggling are so close 
now, individual words can be heard. Pleading for cheaper prices and better 
goods can be heard to the west.

[ Exits: east west ]

not mean they will survive to the other side.  To continue can mean death.

  Suddenly the air takes on a different feel.  It seems to shimmer, and
reflect light differently, blurring the edges of vision slightly.  Colors
seem to blend together a little more, making shapes appear indistinct. 
Faintly, the sound of fizzling or buzzing can be heard in the air, almost as
though an insect swarm is flying nearby.  It's obvious that there are
powerful magics cast about here, and wisdom dictates even more caution than
it's taken to make it this far!

  The air here crackles with intensity.  Blackened scars on the walls still
hold a lingering scent of sulfur, fire, and something less pleasing to the
nose.  A rumble from elsewhere in the pits brings a sprinkle of loosened
dust from the ceiling down upon the unwary, and that sound blends in with
the muffled chanting.

mind-numbingly unbearable.  Portions of bodies, many of which are
unrecognizable beyond being bloody chunks, are scattered about.  The walls
seem to still reverberate with the sound of pained screams.  The longer a
body lingers in this room, the more discomforting it becomes.  This can be a

  This hallway is decorated more nicely than what has been seen so far.  It
appears that beyond here, for those who make it, is where the priciest of
transactions take place.  Slaves whose sole purpose in this world is to keep
this hallway clean spend hours on their knees, scrubbing every inch of
floor.  There are slits within the wall, designed to be money-drops for
large sums of cash.  It's obvious a large amount of money makes its way

delicate nature.  If you want someone to do your work for you, your bidding,
or anything else you have in mind, that's the place to go.  'Slave labor for

Before the East Entrance (G)
  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

the Slaver's Route and farther down, the market area.

one of fantasies both good and bad.  The Fantasy Fields stretch in many
directions, encompassing visions of delight and horror.  Where you stand,
the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

If you were looking for help on the Heal spell, see 'help heal spell'.

Syntax:  heal            : List heal options, keywords, and costs
         heal <keyword>  : Buy given healer option

The 'heal' command is used to interact with an in-room healer mobile, such
as the priestess north of recall.  Healers are able to sell healing and
curative spells, for a price.

Type 'heal' in a room with a healer mobile to find the charges for each
spell.  If there is no healer in the room you're in, you will be told such.

Type heal with the desired argument to purchase that spell.  It will be
cast only once; you may need to buy it again if it is unsuccessful.  Also,
note that some healers are more powerful than others.  If you are having
difficulty getting a successful casting, you may want to find a different
healer.  (Rumor has it that clan healers generally get more business and
are thus a bit more experienced than their counterparts out in the field.)

Healer mobiles will give out (for free) a few spells to players level 20
and under, if that player is willing to wait for them.  This is best
accomplished in rooms that do not have a lot of other traffic.

There is also a video which shows what to do at a healer on Aardwolf:

Syntax: cast heal <character>
Spell Number: 54

This spell heals a great amount of wounds. For primary class clerics, it
heals an even greater amount of wounds, whether cast directly or taken
from a potion.  The cleric must be extremely wise to derive the greatest
benefit from this spell.  Level also has a small effect on the amount 
healed by this spell. Heal and similar spells are less effective during
PK battles.

Primary stat: Wisdom.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.

The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

that could have fixed it too

Eake questions 'what is the point of the summon death spell?'

connection

Ospario answers 'for one thing, it repops every mob in the area, so thats really helpful in a gq'

Your eyes glaze over.

Ospario answers 'for another, they are summoned as mobs with specific weaknesses to your spells'

Eake answers 'Isn't it only for the room you're in?'

Ospario answers 'no'

Eake answers 'Does it not require corpses?'

[Newbie] (Helper) Kelaire: Without seeing what happens and how it happens, I'm not sure I could give
you a good answer to that

Ospario answers 'its a powerful spell, thats why the cooldown is so long'

Ospario answers 'no it does not :)'

Ospario answers 'its just like summon life, except the mobs are easier for necromancers to kill'

wrongly'

Global Quest: Global Quest # 8868 has been won by Zelog - 351st win.

[Newbie] Kulwen: It mentions performing automatic database backup, then says complete.. but never
get the welcome screen

Ospario answers 'it would be terrible if it only worked in 1 room and had a 3-4 hour cooldown or
whatever it is'

[Newbie] (Imm) Sammael: Try pressing 'enter' after that block of text to open the connection

[Newbie] (Helper) Kelaire: Hmm.  Have you tried to reconnect the session after it disconnects?

Ospario answers 'but as it is, i think its pretty good! if only necromancer had more than that kind
of one-two punch it would be more powerful, but that pony has a pretty good trick up its sleeve 
regardless'

[Newbie] Kulwen: It reconnects, but just loops through the same thing. Backs up database then seems
to disconnect.

Nuanse answers 'mobs can have any class builder thinks. There is different things (from diku
is_warrior is_mage) etc. they are all adapted here'

[Newbie] (Imm) Sammael: Aard has several ports you can connect over. 4000 should also work if 23 is

  You have reached the end of the hallway. Not sure why it's so empty in here, 
you decide to return to other, more exciting, parts of the ship. But then you
discover a small cupboard in the wall. You decide to stay a while and try to 
discover what it contains.

     (Hum) The cupboard looks like one you saw in Prosper's room.

  The hallway continues south and back east. There is absolutely no one in this
part of ship. You don't hear a sound from any direction. It is eerily silent.

  This part of the ship is not as busy as other regions, so it seems not
that important.  From here, the hallway continues to the north, to much more
common places.  You can also go west, but it's not clear where this will
lead you.  You see a lamp and siren on the ceiling.

'buzzing' sound can be heard from there. The hallway leads north and south.

A great hall
  As you pass through a painted ceiling you emerge into a great hall.  
The tiles on the floor seem to make a pattern of some sort but the 
dust makes it hard to see.  Large Ionic pillars line the east and 
west walls of this room.  The southern wall is buried under dirt and 
rocks.  You see a faint light coming from an alcove to the north.  It 
adds an eerie glow to the room.

  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its

faint light.

A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this

 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate

Under the labyrinth
  After finally escaping the labyrinth you stop to catch your breath.  So
far, you are still alive and have high hopes of surviving.  The crawl space
you find yourself in has many odd shaped holes in the floor.  With the right
timing you might be able to drop an object and have it land near a friend as
the citadel passes by.

An opening to a forest
  This forest seems oddly cheery.  You can hear birds singing and small
woodland animals scurrying around in the underbrush.  The trees have grown
thickly but not enough to block your way.  There seems to be only one thing
lacking - a path.

  The trees here are still close together but passable.  Carrying on

Making your way through the forest (G)
  The trees here are still close together but passable.  Carrying on
you can now tell that there is a path.  It seems to be a game trail
leading to a murky pond to the east.  What animals have traveled down
this path?  There seems only one way to find out.

A murky pond
  Surrounding the dark pool of water in the middle of the forest are thorny
vines that move when touched.  Sun-bleached bones lie scattered on the
ground and in the water as well.  Every so often you catch some movement
from the pond out of the corner of your eye.  Perhaps it would be wise not
to linger too long.

A great hall
  As you pass through a painted ceiling you emerge into a great hall.  
The tiles on the floor seem to make a pattern of some sort but the 
dust makes it hard to see.  Large Ionic pillars line the east and 
west walls of this room.  The southern wall is buried under dirt and 
rocks.  You see a faint light coming from an alcove to the north.  It 
adds an eerie glow to the room.

[ Exits: north up ]
     One of the small rocks the villager dropped is here. [2/2]

An alcove
  The alcove is large enough that a giant could fit comfortably.  Its
walls are lined by smaller pillars that you saw in the hall.  In the center
there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.  

[ Exits: south ]
(White Aura) A cracked statue is placed here giving off an eerie glow.
A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

The lightside of the coin
  Staring out across the edge of the citadel you can see the land of
Aardwolf whisking by.  You can hear the joy and feel the warmth from within
the small town that lies to the north.  Looking up into the clouds, past the
city, you see the goal of this journey.  Somewhere in that tower lies the
relic you seek.

A back alley
  The way you came is now gone and you find yourself in a back alley.  The
alley walls are high and too flat to get any traction to climb.  The ground
has garbage on it; luckily not much light gets back here so it is not
rotten.  Noises come to you from the opening leading from the alley into the
main part of town.

The main street
  You are greeted by the sound of a cart coming to a halt on a cobblestone
street.  This seems like a thing from one of those sickening faerie tales:
everyone getting along, smiling, and helping each other.  Hopefully you will
not have to put up with this sickening place much longer.

  Soft breezes sway the long grasses invitingly.  A slight scent of seawater
drifts from the north where you can just see a rocky outcropping.  Looking

towards the sound of waves crashing against rocks.

Overlooking a Newly Formed Sea (G)
  Gazing out, all you see is an endless expanse of water.  Far, far below
the waves crash against jagged slices of shoreline.  A thin stretch of beach
is barely visible at the base of the cliffs, and that might just be another
being standing at the water's edge.  The main path continues on right over
the cliff's edge, as if there used to be land there and a place for the path
to go.  Looking around for a possible way down, you spy a fresh trail
heading off to the east.

  Here the winds are no longer gentle, and you struggle to maintain your
tenuous perch on the edge of the path.  Downward there seems to be a
possible descent, but can those rocks possibly hold your weight?  The form
that you previously glimpsed is much clearer, and you can see that it is,
indeed, a person standing on the beach.  Taking a deep breath, you lower
yourself over the edge, determined to ask of this other what has happened
to the peaceful village that once stood here.

  A shallow ledge allows you to pause to take a deep breath.  Screeching
gulls swoop overhead, cursing your intrusion of their domain.  Your
trembling fingers are torn and bleeding from scrambling for purchase on the
jagged rock.  The winds whip you mercilessly, almost sending you reeling off
of the sheer face.  Looking up, you see that to attempt to return to safer
ground is near to impossible.  Down seems to be the only option.

At the Base of the Cliff
  At last, you place your feet on solid ground.  Looking up, you can hardly
believe that you actually were able to make it down the cliff unscathed. 
The beach stretches out before you, inviting you to stroll along and
discover the local flora and fauna.  Everywhere you see rampant signs of
flourishing life.  Tide pools teem with small, scurrying creatures and
shells glisten in the sunlight.  All in all, it is a rather picturesque
place.  Further ahead you can make out with certainty the form of a little
green man gazing out over the waters.  Maybe now you can finally find out
what has happened here.

At the Base of the Cliff
  At last, you place your feet on solid ground.  Looking up, you can hardly
believe that you actually were able to make it down the cliff unscathed. 
The beach stretches out before you, inviting you to stroll along and
discover the local flora and fauna.  Everywhere you see rampant signs of
flourishing life.  Tide pools teem with small, scurrying creatures and
shells glisten in the sunlight.  All in all, it is a rather picturesque
place.  Further ahead you can make out with certainty the form of a little
green man gazing out over the waters.  Maybe now you can finally find out
what has happened here.

Wandering Along the Beach
  The warm sands cushion your steps as you wander closer to the shoreline. 
There seems to be an abundance of life everywhere...  The sands are patterned
with strange, wavering lines, as if something has crawled from the sea to
further up the beach.  All around you are misshapen lumps of sand, and to
the north a large lump seems to be attracting the attention of quite a few
of the gulls.

from atop the cliffs.  What is this that he has handed you?  His gaze turns
back out to the turbulent sea, his face sinking into an expression of deep
sadness.  Looking past him, you see a drop off in the shoreline.  There is a
faint luminescence in the water, almost as if a path has been outlined on
the sea's floor.  Perhaps a closer look is worthwhile.

darkness, you realize that this is another house, again strangely intact. 
However, whatever force brought this house here hasn't left it unscathed.

  The tunnel turns, and suddenly the shallow darkness is broken by a bright
light from the south.  You can hear a clamor rising in the distance, as if
many creatures are gathered.  A shiver of fear races up your spine as you
realize that you are nearing the end of your journey.

A Stone Tunnel
  The tunnel is round in shape, measuring about 10 feet across at any given
point.  The walls are smooth, likely dug out using some kind of magic.  The
dim lights along the walls do little to illuminate the murky passage.

  The reef ends abruptly as a huge wall of stone rises from the sea's
floor.  A tunnel has been laboriously dug into the stone, marked with
glowing sconces filled with some unknown substance.  The dim lights
lead off into the distance, terminating in a sharp curve to the left.  

[ Exits: north south ]
A shiver dances up your spine as you meet this menacing creature's gaze.

  A sheer vista opens before you.  Here the walls of coral rise into a
splendid pinnacle.  Grandiose designs have been etched into it by the ebb
and flow of water.  A giant archway spans the top of the northern wall,
dwarfing the exit below it.  The sheer beauty of this room almost makes
you forget that evil is afoot, and that you have pledged your aid.

Deep in the Coral
  The waters finally calm, and you are able to stand almost upright and
survey your surroundings.  The reef begins to slant upwards to your left,
clearly opening to a larger chamber.  There are small caves ahead and to
the right of you.

  The coral walls close in around you as you travel deeper into this
realm of sea snakes.  Luckily, you are able to use these same walls
to keep yourself from being swept away by the current.  To the west
you can see another cave.  A quick push in that direction should be
enough to get you out of the rush of water.  As you brace to shove
off, you feel a give in the opposite wall.
 
Is that a sign hidden in the coral?

A Coral Cavern (G)
  Here, the walls rise high overhead.  The water rushes in from behind you,
trying to push you farther along.  Grabbing onto a jutting wall, you pause
to get your bearings.  To your left you can see a small cave, virtually
undetectable without close examination.  To the north, the coral closes in
again, with barely enough room for you to pass.

  Everywhere you look, the denizens of this land slither along.  The coral
looms over you, trapping you in the murky depths.  Perhaps this quest is
destined to be ill-fated.  Feeling as if failure is predestined, you
suddenly notice something that quickens your pulse.  There, against the
far wall!  It's an arrow, directing you to continue on to the north;
finally, a sign that you are heading along the correct path.

  Here, the walls rise high overhead.  The water rushes in from behind you,
trying to push you farther along.  Grabbing onto a jutting wall, you pause
to get your bearings.  To your left you can see a small cave, virtually
undetectable without close examination.  To the north, the coral closes in
again, with barely enough room for you to pass.

  The coral walls close in around you as you travel deeper into this

to keep yourself from being swept away by the current.  To the west
you can see another cave.  A quick push in that direction should be
enough to get you out of the rush of water.  As you brace to shove
off, you feel a give in the opposite wall.

Before the Throne Room
  Your heart pounding, you stand on the threshold of the King's throne room.
The hall extends south, widening to both sides.  Gathered here are the most
able of the King's minions.  The ground beneath your feet rumbles, and you
look down to see that a door has been fashioned from the stone.  In choosing
a direction to proceed, you court death as likely as victory.  It is now that
you must decide if this journey is one that you should complete.

Entry to a Stone Palace
  You have finally reached the Palace of the Sea Snake King.  You stand in
the great hall, and are awestruck by the sheer size of this place.  Carved
painstakingly from the stone, its size seems even greater.  Crafted out of
the very walls themselves, gigantic edifices of snakes are depicted clothed
for battle.  The journey to this place has been nothing compared to what you
have yet to endure. Prepare yourself for a challenge like none before.

  Descending even deeper into this dark realm, you find yourself in a
narrow ravine with high rock walls.  The ground is littered with ugly oblong
skulls.  No armor is to be seen, so perhaps they were a primitive race. 
Despite the bleakness of the ravine, the mineral richness you encounter
continues to dazzle you.  Large green emeralds sparkle in the obsidian-like
rock that surrounds you.  Threading your way through pits of quicksand, you
see a trail leading south.

  More skulls crunch beneath your boots.  More emeralds sparkle in the

silence.  It is so dry and barren here, you feel like you are in an
underground desert.  After a bit, the ravine veers east.

  You now float deep in a strange sea that sparkles as if it were made of
liquid amethyst.  Perhaps it is no more than a drop distilled from the magic
of Zangar.  In any case, you are in it, and rather lost.  All is flux and
convolution.  Strange sea creatures come and go, and what first appear to be
sedentary clams scramble about when you take your eyes off of them.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.
