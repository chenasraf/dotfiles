Approaching the Camp
  To the northeast, the snow-shrouded bulk of the long dormant volcano
dominates the horizon.  Even at this distance, the fearsome winds of the
upper slopes are made visible through the wisps of snow streaming from the
peak.  There are two constants in this frozen wasteland - the terrible cold,
so intense it easily penetrates clothing, flesh, sinew and bone, and the
wintry landscape, a pallid white as far as the eye can see.  Here and there
a skeletal tree, branches encased in ice, provides some small respite from
the dreary continuity.  A wide swath of snow has been tramped down by the
passing of dozens of booted feet.  It leads off to the east where a camp of
some sort can be seen, a trickle of rising smoke giving evidence of
habitation.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Inside the East Gate
  You are inside the east gate of Cradlebrook.  People hurry along the
road, eager to get to their destinations.  The road within the village is
well-used, despite the poor trails outside - it seems the villagers like
to keep to themselves.  The walls of the village surround you to the
south, and the east gate is open.  To the west the cobbled street
continues.

Syntax: cast scry <target>
Spell Number: 236

Using this ancient art, a high-powered spellcaster can magically spy upon
others from afar.  The target will only sense a presence, but will never know
who exactly it was.  However, some characters have been able to wish for the
ability to see who is scrying them, and the caster will never be quite sure
who has been granted this wish.

Primary Stats: Int, Wis, Luck.

by the villagers.  A simple stone house is west, the cobblestones leading to
its front door.  There seem to be fewer people here, the road worn but less
used than the one across the river.  A wooden footbridge leads east across
the river.  The cobblestones extend to the north and south.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

The Grand Plaza
  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

Fairdeal Alley
  You stand in Fairdeal Alley just east of Meridian Square.  The light has
dimmed as you stand in the shadows of the spires that tower over the city. 
Looking around at the people occupying the alley, you notice that the people
seem friendly.  Perhaps a little too friendly.  While there is no reason to
be suspicious, a nagging feeling gnaws at the pit of your stomach.

Fairdeal Alley
  Looking down at the roadway that makes up Fairdeal Alley, you notice that
it is slightly bumpy and jagged.  A pleasant and interesting design, it
appears as though the road is paved with coins.  Gold coins of various
denominations have been etched into the ground, making it look as though you
are walking on money.  You feel the desire to bend down and touch the coins
to make sure they are not real, but the amount of people around you deters
your actions.  You wouldn't want to look foolish now, would you?

  Fairdeal Alley is comprised of a number of 'stands' which are nothing
more than simple tables or crates with odds and ends scattered about them. 
Other 'dealers' are searching for artifacts rare in nature.  Some people eye
you with suspicion, others with the delight of another chance to peddle
their wares.  The alley continues north and south, where it turns to head
towards Meridian Square.

  The dimly lit Fairdeal Alley continues north and south.  The alley is
bounded on one side by a large building that seems to take up the entire
length of the alley, but you know of no building in Aylor that presents
itself as that size.  To the west, the spires of Meridian Square tower
overhead, blocking the sun as if standing guard over the city.

  You enter into a dim alley.  The alley is not dark or dingy, nor is it
cluttered or messy.  It is just an alley, and the road is paved to look like
it is covered in gold coins of various denominations.  You get the feeling,
though, that even though the alley is not dark or messy or dingy, it is the
sort of place, given its occupants, that very well should be.  To the north,
the slightly more secure Starlight Way runs east and west through the city.
To the south, Fairdeal Alley takes you to a point that is less readily
escapable.

continues east and west with its haunting midnight glow.

  This is the only store that is on the ground level.  In each direction
(except to the south) marble ramps rise up to other platforms with more
goods for adventurers to buy.  This particular marble slab holds a small
bookstore with many racks of books and guides which apparently sell like
hotcakes, since many of the slots are now empty and vacant.  You begin to
think the store is unmanned until you notice a transparent shadow behind the
desk.  

On the wall you notice a PLAQUE showing the Aardwolf Trivia Hall of Fame.

Hester's Whoswhatzit
  This room is a cluttered mess filled with papers, scrolls, tomes, flasks,
and a large assortment of odds and ends.  There are two distinct paths that
form a cross through the center of the room from one ramp to another, and
there is a spiral staircase heading to a platform directly above this one.  
You can distinctly make out a sign on one wall, which seems interesting.

the narrower path of Fairdeal Alley, appropriately named as it stretches

  Starlight Way continues to the east and west through the grand City of
Aylor.  To the north, you can smell the fresh baked goods of the bakery and
hear the distinct metal-on-metal sound of weapons being tested before
purchase.  The sounds of the armorer announcing his goods also hail from
the north.  This district of town is full of young adventurers haggling for
the best prices on well crafted materials.  In the distance, the solemn
echoes of church bells provide a deep harmony.

  There is something enchanting about walking along the night sky in the middle
of the day, as you continue down the starry path. To the east, you hear the 
bustling activities of adventurers doing their business, purchasing wares, 
and selling off the gains of their toils. Above the clatter you hear someone 
say in a prominent voice, "What?? I don't get it!". The rich smells of breads
and pies fill the air. In the distance, you hear the faint sound of drunken 
dwarves singing.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

Using this ancient art, a high-powered spellcaster can magically spy upon
others from afar.  The target will only sense a presence, but will never know
who exactly it was.  However, some characters have been able to wish for the
ability to see who is scrying them, and the caster will never be quite sure
who has been granted this wish.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

Approaching the Camp
  To the northeast, the snow-shrouded bulk of the long dormant volcano
dominates the horizon.  Even at this distance, the fearsome winds of the
upper slopes are made visible through the wisps of snow streaming from the
peak.  There are two constants in this frozen wasteland - the terrible cold,
so intense it easily penetrates clothing, flesh, sinew and bone, and the
wintry landscape, a pallid white as far as the eye can see.  Here and there
a skeletal tree, branches encased in ice, provides some small respite from
the dreary continuity.  A wide swath of snow has been tramped down by the
passing of dozens of booted feet.  It leads off to the east where a camp of
some sort can be seen, a trickle of rising smoke giving evidence of
habitation.

The Human Refugee Camp
  The human occupants of this ramshackle refugee camp consist almost
entirely of children and the elderly.  Those few that are outdoors, braving
the bitter cold, huddle about a small cook fire, arms extended, palms near
the flames.  To the east and south stand the two largest shelters found in
the camp.  With walls of lashed-together sticks and roofs of straw, these
meager structures are little more than hastily constructed huts.  Numerous
bootprints mark the snow, entering the camp from east and continuing on, in
much smaller numbers, to the north.

>>   At the Foot of the Volcano
  Here at the foot of the looming volcano, no wind blows, no animal calls
out and an eerie quiet abides.  Scraggly bushes, half buried in the deep
snow, provide shelter for the snowshoe rabbits which frequent this area.  A
small snare rests nearby, presently empty and unsprung.  A trail of boot
prints enters from the camp to the south and then turns east toward the
volcano's slopes.

>>   On a Snowbound Trail
  The entire Tbir Mountain is covered in snow.  The trail is buried
somewhere underneath several feet of snow, making travel up the side of the
mountain very treacherous.  Large trees can be seen in the distance, each
tree covered in icicles and the branches sag from the weight of the snow and
ice.  The freezing winds blow snow around on the ground leaving any
footprints covered.  Few people are willing to take the trek up the
mountain, as many who have, have never returned.

On a Bleak Trail
  The mountain looms drearily over the campgrounds.  The desolate state of
the humans leaves little hope for them.  The snow seems to be never-ending
as it lightly falls yet again on the mountain.  The skies above are overcast
with dull grey clouds; it seems the sun never shines.  The mountain begins
to slope upwards here, a slight slope at first, but ahead it can be
discerned that the slope becomes greater.

On a Treacherous Trail
  The snow covered rocks of the mountain make walking nearly impossible. 
The rocks shift and move with each footstep, leaving little room for
mistakes in climbing the large mountain.  The trek up the side of the
mountain seems endless as the wind begins to blow a bit harder.  Snow falls
lightly upon the ground, burying the pathway even further under all the snow
that has fallen already.  Footprints do not stay visible long, as the
falling snow and windy conditions seem to quickly cover them.

On a Rugged Trail
  The rocks of the mountain seem to taper off here, although ahead more can
be seen.  The path isn't clear of rocks, but walking is a bit easier at this
point.  In the distance, a snowshoe rabbit can be seen in search for food. 
Although the rabbit blends in very well with the snow, it can be spotted due
to the dark color on the tip of the ears.  Even for the animals that live on
the mountain, food is very scarce.  The humans hunt the rabbits for food,
but due to the quickness of the rabbit, actually killing one for food is
rare.

>>   On a Rocky Trail
  The rocks are bigger here than they are lower down the mountainside,
making it harder to navigate.  The rocks are big enough that the only way
across some of them is to climb over them.  The snow on the rocks makes it
very hard to get a good footing on them, thus making it very easy to slip. 
One wrong move could prove to be deadly, sending an adventurer tumbling to
their death on the jagged rocks below.  The climb up the mountain is
dangerous, although many humans have attempted the trek for the legendary
Fire Gem in hopes of bringing warmth back to the outside world.

On a Deadly Trail
  Partially covered in bloodstained snow is a half eaten human corpse.  It
is unclear if the human died from the freezing cold of the snow and wind,
and was then eaten, or if some savage animal attacked it and killed it for
food.  Either way, the remains are now frozen in time from the elements of
the severe snow storm.  The body couldn't have been here too awfully long,
as it would be completely covered in snow, or perhaps it has been dug up for
yet another meal before the body completely froze.

On a Windswept Trail
  The cold piercing wind is blowing fiercely from the west.  The only sound
in the distance is the roar of the wind.  Food and water are nowhere to be
found.  The land is barren, frost bitten, and covered in snow.  Camping here
would be a mistake.  The only direction to move towards is up.

  The wind gusts, blowing the snow in a blizzard-like manner. The snow
falls heavily, covering any footsteps quickly.  The view from the top of the
mountain reveals nothing but snowy desolate land.  To the north, the opening
of the volcano can be seen in the distance.  The trek has been almost
unbearable.  The journey to the crater is still very dangerous.  Rocks jut
up from the snow - one wrong move could send any adventurer over the edge
to their death.

Within the Crater
  The bottom of the crater is marred by small rocks, large rocks - all
kinds of stones have been scattered around the dusty floor, with some rocks
as large as a small house.  The dust is disturbed by footprints of the
humans who have struggled past, going east and south through the few viable
paths in the rocks.  Creatures laugh at the hapless adventurers from their
safe perch at the rim of the crater, for they know, of those who have gone
down, few have returned intact.

  A meandering path is faintly scored on the dusty floor, winding through
the larger rocks.  The west is obscured by the self-same rocks which prevent
easy passage, and an eerie whistling emits from the south, where an outline
of a massive gate can be seen.  A distant light softens the hard rocks and
illuminates a kind of path for the weary to tread, accompanied by voices
from none know where, inanely pleading and begging for a salvation no one
can give.

  Huge black gates loom over the scrawny adventurers, seeking the heat that
the volcano hides.  The slightly augmented temperature is the sole thing
that guides these poor half-frozen souls up here.  The gate is forbidding,
almost mocking in its severity and austerity.  Its sole purpose is to keep
those in need out.  To that end, two burly guards, wielding spears, stand
here and jeer at the pathetic sight the humans portray, occasionally jabbing
at them with their weapons.

  Carved deep into the side of the crater, this cavernous chamber is a
testament to the skill of dwarven excavators, engineers and artisans. 
Torches mounted in iron brackets illuminate the elaborately etched basalt
walls.  Depicted are what appear to be scenes of battle from throughout the
Swordbreaker clan's history.  In one tableau, Tbir Swordbreaker himself is
shown standing atop a mountain of corpses, holding high a gleaming gemstone.
An enormous flight of stone steps, stretching from one side of the chamber
to the next, descends into the volcano's depths.  To the west stand the
massive black gates, leading back to the crater and the brutal cold.

  The street enters from the east, turns a corner and then continues on to
the south.  On the western side, recessed into the tunnel wall, is yet
another dwarven residence.  Built with the same dark volcanic rock used
extensively throughout the city, the stone used in this structure bears one
striking difference from that seen elsewhere - each brick is veined with
quartz and the entire structure is assembled in such a way that those veins
are aligned from one brick to the next.  This has the rather spectacular
effect of suggesting a giant spider's web, spun in pearlescent white across
the entire face of the building.

southern side, partly fashioned out of colossal granite blocks and partly

southern side, partly fashioned out of colossal granite blocks and partly
carved directly into the tunnel's wall, is a fortress of some kind.  A
towering iron portcullis and a contingent of heavily armed guards deny entry
to its interior.  To the north, another imposing structure reveals itself as
a garrison through the bark of officers shouting orders and the clatter of
marching armored feet.

respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look

In the distance, large dwellings can be seen in both the northwest and 
northeast. To the northwest lies a mansion of sorts, while to the northeast 
lies a small village.

  The rocky path you have been traversing becomes increasingly well-travelled 
as you approach a four-way intersection. To the north, you see the glassy 
building more clearly than before. In the distance to the east, you discern a
small, fortified village. In the distance to the west, towers a dark, 
foreboding mansion.

  Continuing down the rocky surface, the path below appears to be less

to visitors from the outside world. Perhaps very few people from the outside 
world even know of this place. Either way, you should probably check with the
locals before exploring any further.

  The rocky path appears all but abandoned as you travel further west. You 
notice, with unease, that the path takes a turn towards to the north, leading
directly to the foreboding mansion. A large boulder blocks most of the view 
of the mansion, so very little can truly be discovered. From here, there 
appears to be absolutely no signs of life.

A frozen expanse
  You are standing on a frozen plain. Snow covers everything you see. In the 
middle of the plain, a huge tree rises from the ground like a beacon of 
life. The cry of a wolf echoes through the area. Other howls respond, 
creating a chorus of howls. The plains continue to the north, east, and 
south.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
This hunter scours the plains, looking for his next meal.

The frozen tundra
  You are standing on a frozen tundra. The area is a vast wasteland of snow.
Large paw prints cover the snow. Nothing seems to be growing except to the 
east where a huge tree climbs high into the sky. The tree is so large it 
casts a shadow over you, blocking the warmth of the sun.

[ Exits: north east south ]
A huge mammoth rests here.

The frozen tundra
  You are standing on a frozen tundra. Snow covers everything like a blanket.
The frigid wind blows the snow and ice across the plains, and it rips across 
your face like sandpaper. Nothing seems to be growing except to the east 
where a huge tree climbs high into the sky. The tree is so large it casts a 
shadow over you, blocking the warmth of the sun.

An arctic expanse
  Huge mammoth tracks cross the deep snow. A huge tree dominates the landscape,
rising high into the sky to the east. The sun tries to poke out from behind 
the tree, but the tree is too massive. The snowy plains continue as far as 
you can see.

A wintry plain
  You are standing in the snow covered plains. A small pine tree used to grow 
here, but was trampled by the mammoths, as their huge prints cover the area.
Several pine cones lie scattered on the ground, perhaps a chance at new life.
The shadows of the Tree of Sodrus continue to block out the sun.

The frigid plains
  The soft snowfall has left a thick layer of snow on the ground, covering 
everything in its cold embrace. The sun shines brightly overhead, but even 
that heat isn't enough to overcome the brutal cold. Time seems to have frozen
here, as nothing seems to be moving.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
A loud echo assaults your senses.

The icy champaign
  The heavy blanket of snow hides a layer of ice underneath, making for 
treacherous footing. The natural trap could ensnare even the hardiest of 
adventurers. The plains continue in all directions, and it seems as though 
everything has hidden from the frosty breath of winter.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
Some ice cracks ominously below you.

Standing in the snow
  You are standing in the deep snow of the plains. It comes nearly to your 
waist, and it continues falling. The upper layer of snow is light and fluffy,
but the deepest layers are frozen ice. Icy walls rise to the north and west, 
making it unpassable.

  After stepping inside the cave, the air continues to blast you. Huge icicles 
hang from the ceiling and walls. It appears as though the cave was carved out
of the stone, as claw marks cover the entire surface. Tracks cover the 
frost-covered ground. A large hole leads up through the cave ceiling.

to be much warmer. Huge puddles dot the ground, except in the area of the 
entrance from the lower cave where the frigid air still freezes the water 
nearby. The cave is dark, and by feeling around, you find the only exit is to
the north, or back the way you came.

The upper caverns
  You are standing in the upper caverns. The air here is warm and comfortable.
The room is dark and you can barely make out the passage to the west or to 
the south. Some old, cracked paintings cover the wall. They appear to be 
drawings of men killing a mammoth.

Underneath the Cliffs of Valhan
  You are standing in the shadows of the cliffs. The boulders here have fallen,
and created a spot you can climb up. The icy surfaces of the boulders make it
a hazardous climb. The cliffs continue to the north and the plains to the 
west. Hidden in the snow, you notice a deep black hole. A small cave lies 
nearly covered in the snow, but the entrance is accessible. Small rocks line 
the entrance to the tunnel as though placed there purposefully.

At the Town Gates of Dharivian
  The huge gates are wide open, and the guard posted there gives you a warm
and friendly greeting.  It strikes you as out-of-place, though, as you
meander through the streets.  The crowds open before you like a parting sea-
the citizens of Dharivian act as though they're afraid you'll pass the
plague onto them.  Not that this is a place ripe for brewing disease - the
wooden buildings to either side of the street are freshly painted, and yards
neatly kept.  Even the dirt roads are free of debris, and when a child
carelessly tosses an apple core to the ground, her mother screams in fear
and gives her a swat.  Apparently littering isn't too popular here.

On the Streets of Dharivian (G)
  The deeper you penetrate this large town, the more you get the feeling
that something is terribly wrong here.  Even in the thickest crowds, not a
single pickpocket has made an attempt at your gold, and you haven't even
seen any beggars.  The towers of the royal palace loom larger as you draw
near to it, casting shadows so deep that odd glass balls filled with glowing
insects have been set on poles to provide illumination.  It's when you reach
the gates of the palace itself that you spot a sign that might explain the
paranoid behavior of the populace.

The Palace of Queen Jula (G)
  The Dharivian palace is truly a marvel to behold.  No doubt, the
tyrannies of Queen Jula must have included severe taxes to pay for the
furnishings here.  The walls are plated in pure gold, with trimmings of
glistening silver, and precious jewels were used to form murals on the
walls.  These pictures, of course, portray the Queen at her most beauteous,
as a conquering hero and gracious ruler.  You find the Queen herself holding
court in the main hall, mounted on a throne carved from emerald, high above
everybody else on her dais.  Oh, well.  Better luck next life.

The Entrance(?) to the Labyrinth
  The deathberry hedges of Dharivian are famed throughout the world.  Not
only do they bear heavy clusters of fruit in the form of luscious, poisonous
berries, but they can easily be shaped into all sorts of forms.  In this
case, the magic of Queen Jula has forced the shrubbery into long, enclosed
corridors.  The branches lace together overhead, forming a roof a hundred
feet high, and the passages are wide enough that several giants could walk
abreast.  You can see nothing but green and the occasional splash of scarlet
berry in every direction.

  The labyrinth continues.  Here the neat grass present in the rest of the
maze has been worn away by the passage of many creatures.  This makes it a
lot easier to spot the yellowed bones of animals scattered down the length
of this corridor and avoid tripping over them.  Grizzled grey tufts of
coarse fur have been captured by the deathberry thorns, and large pawprints
have been embedded in the bare earth.  From here, you can head east or

A Nauseating Corridor in the Labyrinth
  The labyrinth continues.  No sunlight or moonlight penetrates the curved,
thorny ceiling high above, leaving the passageways of the maze in darkness
similar to that of the day's dying rays.  It's not easy to see here without
straining one's eyes.  Those bright scarlet deathberries shine though, their
venomous fruit glowing with an inner, magic light.  They look mighty
tempting, attested to by the various bird carcasses laying near the hedge
walls.  Needless to say, the odor in the air here is nauseating.  Want to
get away from it?  Head north, east, or west.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand before a huge door.  The corridor can easily fit fifteen humans
standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

Corner of Wyrm Street and Sunset
  You stand in the north western corner of the Underdark.  The bustling
streets sound distant and the hum of people moving and talking barely
reaches your ears.  The only light in this section of the city comes from
your light source.  You stand against the huge caverns walls.  Water
glints in the light on the walls.

Wyrm Street goes east, and Sunset goes south.

North end of Sunset
  You stand almost in the very north west corner of the city.  The streets up
here are not as used as those towards the centre of the city.  To the south
you see some of the dwellings of the creatures that inhabit this gloomy
city.  There is nothing of note that you can see here, but then again it could
just be the darkness that lies just beyond your insignificant circle of light.

To the north is the corner of the city, to the south Sunset continues.

  You wonder who it was that named these dreadful streets such cheery
names.  The street upon which you stand is nothing like sunset, the only
reason you can even think up is the fact that sunset is on the west side of
the city.  Screams echo towards you from all sides assaulting your senses. 
Your eyes hurt from trying to pierce the darkness that lies everywhere.  The
ground is rough through your boots.  The air is cool, and the cavern wall to
your west glints with wetness.

  You stand on Sunset.  There is little that you can see here, your light just
fades into darkness without illuminating anything.  For some reason this
section of the city is very quiet.  The silence here in fact is over powering,
you can barely stand it after all the noises of the city.  The single floating
orb flickers on and off.

Sunset goes on to the north and south.

anyway, in fact it almost looks as if the ceiling has become higher.  The
walls are bare, but even though they are bare, they are beautiful and

colours to come scintillating out of the wall.

  You are standing at the south end of this green and black corridor.  You
have noticed that in these halls there are few decorations.  A soft flickering

polished onyx.

Slaver's Route, Before the Brothel
  The Slaver's Route, almost everyone in the Underdark has walked along
these famous stones.  It was along this road that the city was made. 
Without the slave trade, the city would not have expanded as fast as it did
when the city was first built.  The Underdark has since become a trade
centre where those who dwell beneath the ground and those above can
interact in relative safety.

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely

Help Keywords : Channels.
Help Category : Communication.
Related Helps : Channel Rules, Class Channels, Colorset, Say.
Last Updated  : 2021-01-30 15:35:48.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Syntax: Type 'Channels' to see a list.
              Type [channel name] to toggle on / off.
              Use '[channel] *off [minutes]' to turn off temporarily.
              Use 'channels curse' to see a list of curse allowed channels.
              Use '[channel] -h' or '[channel] -h <# lines / text>' to see 
              channel history.

Further details and other usage options are in the wall of text below.

There are many means of communication on Aardwolf and channels are one of
the most important.  Channels on Aardwolf can change dynamically based on
topics relevant at the time.  To see a list of channels, type 'channels'.
To toggle a channel on or off, type its name.

Each class also has its own private channel which only members of that
class can see. These are covered in 'help class channels'.  Information on
each channel's particular rules and guidelines can be found in 'help 
<channel name>', e.g., 'help racetalk'.

Most channels have a history feature.  To see the history on a channel, use
the syntax '<channelname> -h'.  For example, 'gossip -h 10' will show the
last 10 lines on gossip, while 'answer -h' will show all available lines of
history on the question/answer channel.  You can also use the -h feature to
search for text on a channel; for example, 'gossip -h ivar' will search for
all gossip history containing 'ivar'.  Ignored players (see 'help ignore')
will still show up in channel history.  Note that you can either search or
specify a number of lines, but not both.

To search for a number without the MUD interpreting it as a number of
lines, use the syntax "gossip -h '20'" (this shows all gossip history
containing the number 20).

There are some special commands that can be used on channels to do emotes, 
socials and other actions. Using gossip as an example:

   Use a social on a channel       : gossip *smile
                                     gossip *smile ivar
   Use an emote on a channel       : gossip :emotes something
   Use emote to think on a channel : gossip *think this is cool
   Use emote to say on a channel   : gossip *say say is cool too :)
   Use dice on a channel           : gossip *dice 10 5

The following is a list of channels approved for profane language:

   Clantalk*   Curse       Ftalk       Gclan     Gtell       
   Helper      Immtalk     Mchat       Music     Pokerinfo   
   Spouse      Sports      Debate

* Though the channel is flagged for curse socials, clans may have their own
policies regarding profane language.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

Wandering along a dirt path
  As a grizzled prospector shuffles past you, you notice that he is not in
good health.  In fact, everyone seems to be physically exhausted and
mentally anguished.  All the non-stop mining is what hurts them so much. 
Ripped tents dot the settlement in a very erratic pattern: three are clustered
to the north, then there is a large gap between those and the next tent 300
meters away.  You get the impression that people just don't care anymore! 
As you walk on a little bit further, you see a note attached to one of the
tents to your south.

Wandering along a dirt path
  You continue along the dirt path in western Sargasso, and the random
arrangement of tents continues all around you.  The settlement wall (if you
can call it that) lies a little ways to the north, but there are so many
rocks in the way that proceeding farther in that direction would be
impossible.  The wind picks up again and you choke and gag as you inhale
some of the horrid dust-stuff.  Muttering something about stupid mining
settlements, you decide to put up with the wind and simply press onwards. 
The large tent to the west looks rather safe compared with the hot wind and
dust you have to deal with outside.

  You continue along the dirt path in western Sargasso, and the random
arrangement of tents continues all around you.  The settlement wall (if you
can call it that) lies a little ways to the north, but there are so many
rocks in the way that proceeding farther in that direction would be
impossible.  The wind picks up again and you choke and gag as you inhale
some of the horrid dust-stuff.  Muttering something about stupid mining
settlements, you decide to put up with the wind and simply press onwards. 
The large tent to the west looks rather safe compared with the hot wind and
dust you have to deal with outside.

Wandering along a dirt path
  The dirt path ends rather abruptly, giving way to a wooden structure to
the south.  A large sign rests in front of the iron door, and a tiny
tumbleweed floats across your vision.  You grin nervously as you remember
that if the DIRT of this settlement is weird, then maybe this tumbleweed is
too.  The city wall lies beyond the building to your south, while part of
Sargasso's principal mine shaft is to your east - too bad you can only enter
by going south from the center of town.  A large tent is to your west, while
another, uninhabited one lies south; you get the feeling that the latter
plays a huge role in the safety of the camp.

Inside a large tent
  Compared with the rest of Sargasso, this fairly large tent is organized
and clean, although by no means would it ever win any awards for odor.  It
smells like rotten meat inside, and a careful inspection reveals a dead rat
carcass in one of the corners of the tent.  How utterly sick!  Perhaps this
tent isn't so clean after all.  Shaking your head, you decide to leave the
citizens of Sargasso to their own devices.  Let them wallow in their own
filth.

  The iron door behind you slowly creaks shut, making a horrible grating
sound as the metal scrapes the oak floor.  A pile of very important looking
documents rests below a stone gargoyle-like paperweight.  A birchwood file
cabinet lies in the northeast corner of the room, accumulating dust. 
Evidently, it has not been used in a very long while.  You grimace as you
realize how chaotic the scene is - like everyone else in the town, the
sheriff doesn't seem to care about anyone except himself.  You advance
carefully towards the sheriff's desk, making sure that there are no loose
planks in the floor - if you were to fall through it would be a MASSIVE case
of "I've fallen and I can't get up."  I don't think anyone wants to relive
THAT nightmare again.

  As a grizzled prospector shuffles past you, you notice that he is not in
good health.  In fact, everyone seems to be physically exhausted and
mentally anguished.  All the non-stop mining is what hurts them so much. 
Ripped tents dot the settlement in a very erratic pattern: three are clustered
to the north, then there is a large gap between those and the next tent 300
meters away.  You get the impression that people just don't care anymore! 
As you walk on a little bit further, you see a note attached to one of the

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

  This tent doesn't seem to be as bad as the others you've seen.  It's
fairly clean, in good repair, and lacks bugs and rat carcasses.  In fact,
from the way the furniture is arranged and the bed is made, you realize that
the owner of the dwelling is a pretty conscientious individual.  A heap of
tarp is lying on the floor; it is presumably used for patching up the holes
that so frequently occur in a tent in an environment like that of Sargasso. 
Admiring the work that goes into maintaining such an unstable dwelling, you
can't help but smile to yourself because finally, you see a hint of goodness
in Sargasso.

  Whomever owns this poor excuse for a home is either completely oblivious
to its state of disrepair or simply doesn't care.  Whatever the reason may
be, the fact still remains that there are huge holes in the tent's top. 
While this does afford a decent view of the night sky, you cleverly deduce
that it must be a tremendous pain to sleep here during times of inclement
weather.  The dirt floor is crawling with numerous species of vermin:
cockroaches, lizards, and scorpions.  How anyone can live in these kinds of
conditions is a mystery to a civilized person like you.  You make a
disgusted face even as you stand in the midst of some very angry bugs.

that you never thought Sargasso could offer. A string of wooden beads colored
with fluorescent pinks, greens, and yellows graces the top of the tent, 
draped like holiday lights on a log cabin. Covering the fortune teller's 
circular table in the center of the abode is a sky blue handwoven cloth 
dotted with pastel purple flowers. In the middle of this piece of furniture 
is a shiny crystal ball. Its grasp on you is hypnotic, almost as if it were 
drawing you somewhere else. A gold-laced sack lies in the far corner of the

Indeed, the tent is quite awe inspiring. The dirty path lies to the north.

  This is the bustling center of the Oreh hideout.  To your north you can
see cots and bunks of the Orehs' living quarters.  From the east you can
smell the most delectable scents of fresh bread and stew.  The angry
shouting to the south makes you wonder if you should explore in that
direction.

Climbing a cold mountain trail
  You are standing on a cold mountain trail. The trail leads upwards in the 
mountain and the cliffs on either side allow you shelter from the winds, 
while you walk along the path. The rocks are covered with ice, creating a 
hazardous surface to walk up. Best to walk carefully.

The hazardous path
  This mountain trail continues to the north. It is covered in snow and ice, 
making it unsafe to walk along for the unwary. The cliff walls rise to either
side, and are so steep that you cannot climb them. Large rocks litter the 
ground from where they fell overhead.

Climbing the snowy mountain
  This section of the trail is covered with a deep snow, making it difficult to

might be best to avoid that snow. The trail seems to end here, but if you 
climb up the trail continues there.

from the rocks above. Smoke rises into the air from somewhere to the

A turn in the path
  You arrive at a turn in the path. The path to the west leads down to a little
cabin. Some smoke drifts from the cabin, ensuring that a warm fire is lit.
In contrast, the snowy bleakness of the eastern path continues up the 
mountain. The sun shines overhead causing a strong glare from all the snow.

The dead calm
  You are standing in a natural shelter from the cold. The snow is piled up, 
creating a barrier from the elements. It also deadens the other sounds, which
makes the area seem calm, as if lulling you into a false sense of security.
Vast plains open to the east, where the icy winds blow.

The twin pines
  You are standing before a tall pine tree. Legend has it that this tree was 
planted with its twin to celebrate the life and love of Rythemus and Lantana.
They died tragically in this spot. Upon their death the land grew cold and 
barren. Their friend, Thylinimus, planted these two trees as a memorial, and 
the trees immediately began to grow. These two trees still survive as a 
symbol of their love and devotion to each other - one of the signs of hope on
this desolate tundra.

can move about with relative ease, almost as if on surface.  While relaxing
to strained muscles after the long swim, it is also a curious sensation. 
Looking around in an attempt to survey the vista before you, a dark shadow
of movement above causes you to grasp your weapon just a little more
tightly.  What strange new world have you entered, and are you welcome?

  The light enters the water, breaking into a prism of colors dancing on
the current.  You feel yourself being carried in the rythmic swells, rising
and falling with the nearby tides.  Looking down into the darkness below,
you wonder what sort of creature dares to exist in the murky depths at the
bottom on the ocean.

Swimming Down into the Deep
  The light fades as you begin to swim toward the depths below.  As you
begin your descent, you feel the pressure of the ocean swallowing you.  Your
curiosity becomes tinged with fear, yet you must know what you might find. 
Are the rumors true?

On the Ocean Floor
  Resting your feet against the ocean floor, you stop and realize that you
do not feel the intense pressure you thought you might at this depth.  You
can move about with relative ease, almost as if on surface.  While relaxing
to strained muscles after the long swim, it is also a curious sensation. 
Looking around in an attempt to survey the vista before you, a dark shadow
of movement above causes you to grasp your weapon just a little more
tightly.  What strange new world have you entered, and are you welcome?

  The Great Coral Tower rises from the sands in a gigantic pinnacle. 
Sharkonian guards protect the entranceway.  Other Sharkonians go in and out

  This is the seat of power and authority here in Sharkatan.  Even though
the structure is made of coral, it is awe-inspiring and impressive.  The
walls of the structure are highly tended, with workers constantly upkeeping
the structure.  The tower reaches far above the ocean floor, its presence
not only seen, but felt throughout the entire Coral Kingdom.

  This floor houses the offices of some of the most powerful creatures in

The Throne Room of the Sharkatan Royals
  The room seems to go on forever in its expansiveness.  Guards line the
Throne Room, their presence felt, but barely noticable.  You are instead
drawn to the large and impressive throne at the room's end.  You feel tiny
and insignificant in the room, and feel yourself almost cowering at the
power emanating from the Lord of Sharkatan who oversees his Kingdom from
this room.

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.

Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

Approaching a small mine shaft
  After having spent some time in the dirty, run down settlement of
Sargasso, you realize that the only thing the prospectors have is mining. 
They left their families and decided to dedicate themselves to one single
task.  The wind starts to pick up a little and the weird dirt-stuff flies
around for a little bit, but the gusts are not nearly as horrible as when
you were walking upon the mountain.  Still, the smell of charred flesh,
which was absent to the north, lingers on here.  What could these miners be
doing to paint such a horrid picture of the town?  You shrug off the
question, thinking it could not possibly be on purpose.  To the west you see
a beautifully colored hut and wonder why something so vibrant would be in a
place of such death and misery.

  Rotting oak posts support the ceiling of this very old looking mine

there's something more to the mineshaft ...  something beautiful, yet
forgotten for countless ages.  The upper level of the mine shaft continues
south of here, or you can explore the depths of the mine below.

Exploring underground
  This mine shaft is certainly much bigger than you thought it would be! 
It appears that the Sargasso miners certainly found a bit more than ore when
they dug deep inside the ground.  The underground caverns seem almost
endless, and you can't help but notice that they seem to be very ancient,
unlike the relatively new mine shaft.  You can climb back up the rope to the
mining settlement, but you get the feeling that it would be much nicer to
explore underground instead.  Paths spiral off in each direction, and you
really don't know which would be the best way to go.  Tiny little runes are
carved inside one of the cavern's walls in runny black ink.  Maybe coming to
Sargasso wasn't such a huge waste after all.

Exploring underground
  Even though you are still relatively close to the Sargasso mineshaft, you
cannot believe how different this place is from the accursed town.  Whereas
Sargasso had almost nothing but horror and evil, the underground has a
mysterious quality.  You don't know exactly how to catergorize it: sometimes
the cavern gives off a feeling of warmth and light, other times you cringe
in fear, wondering if your own shadow has turned against you.  Bowing your
head slightly, you utter a quick prayer to your god, asking him to protect
you.  The tunnel opens up into a huge chamber here, and by the way the dust
flies around the opening you can tell that some entity passed through here
quite recently.

Exploring underground
  Clank, clank, clank.  In the distance you hear iron weapons being
sharpened on the granite walls of the cave, and you worry that you might be
ambushed somewhere ...  But where?  You start thinking that the more you
travel in these strange lands the more questions pop into your head - but
you still have no answers.  The smell of fresh blood wafts in from the
south, and you question the wisdom of travelling in that direction.  You
wrinkle your nose at the prospect of seeing another dead body (even the most
bloodthirsty of warriors has an occasional pang of guilt when seeing a
rotting carcass).  You can also travel east or west to what you hope is a
safer part of the tunnel.

  You find yet another dead end in this very strange yet exciting cavern. 
The granite walls are soft to the touch - they feel like a goose down pillow
feels after weeks of hard travelling.  Some massive erosion must have taken
place for the walls to get like this, but you can't help but wonder exactly
HOW.  After all, this mine shaft was constructed fairly recently, so it
would be silly to think that someone could actually be LIVING down here ...

have done that, then return to me and say that Harold is sober, and then I 
will tell you more about what has been happening around here. The horses 
around here sometimes have buckets, and you will have to find the water on 
your own."

Exploring underground
  You find yet another dead end in this very strange yet exciting cavern. 
The granite walls are soft to the touch - they feel like a goose down pillow
feels after weeks of hard travelling.  Some massive erosion must have taken
place for the walls to get like this, but you can't help but wonder exactly
HOW.  After all, this mine shaft was constructed fairly recently, so it
would be silly to think that someone could actually be LIVING down here ...

Exploring underground
  Clank, clank, clank.  In the distance you hear iron weapons being
sharpened on the granite walls of the cave, and you worry that you might be
ambushed somewhere ...  But where?  You start thinking that the more you
travel in these strange lands the more questions pop into your head - but
you still have no answers.  The smell of fresh blood wafts in from the
south, and you question the wisdom of travelling in that direction.  You
wrinkle your nose at the prospect of seeing another dead body (even the most
bloodthirsty of warriors has an occasional pang of guilt when seeing a
rotting carcass).  You can also travel east or west to what you hope is a
safer part of the tunnel.

Exploring underground
  Even though you are still relatively close to the Sargasso mineshaft, you
cannot believe how different this place is from the accursed town.  Whereas
Sargasso had almost nothing but horror and evil, the underground has a
mysterious quality.  You don't know exactly how to catergorize it: sometimes
the cavern gives off a feeling of warmth and light, other times you cringe
in fear, wondering if your own shadow has turned against you.  Bowing your
head slightly, you utter a quick prayer to your god, asking him to protect
you.  The tunnel opens up into a huge chamber here, and by the way the dust
flies around the opening you can tell that some entity passed through here
quite recently.

Exploring underground
  This mine shaft is certainly much bigger than you thought it would be! 
It appears that the Sargasso miners certainly found a bit more than ore when
they dug deep inside the ground.  The underground caverns seem almost
endless, and you can't help but notice that they seem to be very ancient,
unlike the relatively new mine shaft.  You can climb back up the rope to the
mining settlement, but you get the feeling that it would be much nicer to
explore underground instead.  Paths spiral off in each direction, and you
really don't know which would be the best way to go.  Tiny little runes are
carved inside one of the cavern's walls in runny black ink.  Maybe coming to
Sargasso wasn't such a huge waste after all.

Inside a small mine shaft
  Rotting oak posts support the ceiling of this very old looking mine
shaft.  You find this to be very strange, because all the other clues point
to the fact that Sargasso is a relatively new settlement.  How odd.  Maybe
there's something more to the mineshaft ...  something beautiful, yet
forgotten for countless ages.  The upper level of the mine shaft continues
south of here, or you can explore the depths of the mine below.

Approaching a small mine shaft
  After having spent some time in the dirty, run down settlement of
Sargasso, you realize that the only thing the prospectors have is mining. 
They left their families and decided to dedicate themselves to one single
task.  The wind starts to pick up a little and the weird dirt-stuff flies
around for a little bit, but the gusts are not nearly as horrible as when
you were walking upon the mountain.  Still, the smell of charred flesh,
which was absent to the north, lingers on here.  What could these miners be
doing to paint such a horrid picture of the town?  You shrug off the
question, thinking it could not possibly be on purpose.  To the west you see
a beautifully colored hut and wonder why something so vibrant would be in a
place of such death and misery.

Inside Sargasso's gate
  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

Wandering along a dirt path
  As a grizzled prospector shuffles past you, you notice that he is not in
good health.  In fact, everyone seems to be physically exhausted and
mentally anguished.  All the non-stop mining is what hurts them so much. 
Ripped tents dot the settlement in a very erratic pattern: three are clustered
to the north, then there is a large gap between those and the next tent 300
meters away.  You get the impression that people just don't care anymore! 
As you walk on a little bit further, you see a note attached to one of the
tents to your south.

Wandering along a dirt path
  You continue along the dirt path in western Sargasso, and the random
arrangement of tents continues all around you.  The settlement wall (if you
can call it that) lies a little ways to the north, but there are so many
rocks in the way that proceeding farther in that direction would be
impossible.  The wind picks up again and you choke and gag as you inhale
some of the horrid dust-stuff.  Muttering something about stupid mining
settlements, you decide to put up with the wind and simply press onwards. 
The large tent to the west looks rather safe compared with the hot wind and
dust you have to deal with outside.

  Stepping through the portal, you find yourself inside an illusionary
world of fire and ash.  The heat generated by this inferno is very real,
however, as is evidenced by the bands of sweat on your forehead.  You reason
that you should try to stay away from some of the bigger flames, just to be
safe.  A huge flare burts forth to the east, alerting you to the fact that
you are in more and more danger with each second that you stay.  Desperate,
you run around, dodging flames, trying to find a way out.  Suddenly, a ring
of fire encircles you, scorching your eyebrows with its tendrils of heat. 
The flames converge into one massive pillar, and a seductive temptress
dressed completely in red emerges.

only succeed in scratching your hand pretty badly.  Ouch!  Those stupid
portals must only be one way.  You mutter to yourself and decide that it's
not a good idea to randomly enter mirrors hoping that they are portals.  At
least you'll know for next time.  Still, the high concentration of energy
suggests to you that some mystical force is at work here - you just don't

energy of the stars themselves are being funneled into the castle.  Indeed,
you feel like some kind of cosmic force is protecting you from harm.  Unlike
the light of the stars, however, the light is somewhat chilly, almost as if
it has been corrupted.  The sensation increases as you head north, towards
the jail, but decreases as you go south towards the portal room.  The throne
room is far ahead of you, a long way to the east.

  Two tapestries woven of pure silken threads grace the diamond walls of

absorbing the light then dispersing it in a prismatic spiral.  The
chandelier hanging from the ceiling has no candles with which to
illuminate the corridor, yet it gives off a tranquil radiance which urges

cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which

  The altar before you is truly a sight to behold.  Made entirely of
sapphire, it is a wonderous contrast to the color of the rest of the
cathedral.  It gleams and shines with its own inner light, a testament that
there must be some true magic contained within.  As you close your weary
eyes and murmer a prayer to your god, a wave of placidity washes over you,
calming your soul and filling you with a respect for all forms of life.  As
you turn to the east to leave, you stare longingly at the altar, hoping that
sometime soon you can return and be embraced by its loving light once more.

       DSR : Investigate what caused the miners to disappear from within the mines.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Sober up Harold, Sheriff Jack's deputy. (Completed)

Jack the Sheriff says, "Before I go any farther, can you go find my worthless
deputy Harold? He is usually drunk at the saloon, and I have had to throw a 
bucket of water on Harold to sober him up enough to do anything. When you 
have done that, then return to me and say that Harold is sober, and then I 
will tell you more about what has been happening around here. The horses 
around here sometimes have buckets, and you will have to find the water on 
your own." 

Task 2  : Tell Jack that Harold is sober. (Completed)

Jack the Sheriff says, "When you have done that, return to me and say that 
Harold is sober." 

Task 3  : Ask Katherine about the missing miners. (Completed)

Sheriff Jack says, "Asking Katherine about the missing miners might help." 

Task 4  : Ask Tomas about the missing miners. (Completed)

Sheriff Jack says, "Asking Tomas about the missing miners would be a good 
place to start." 

Task 5  : Find out what you can from the assassins in the mine. (Completed)

Katherine says, "I think that you should find the assassins, and see if you 
can get more information from them." 

Task 6  : Ask Abigail about the accidents.

Tomas says, "If you want to know more about the accidents, then I would ask 
Abigail about them." 

Task 7  : Ask Contessa about the guards.

The note from the Contessa reads:
"My loyal assassins, because of the way that some of the guards have been 
behaving recently, I am instructing you to delay the progress of the surface 
miners by any means necessary until the problem can be resolved. I do not 
enjoy giving this order, but they must be kept away from here for their own 
protection."

 will do any harm to tell you about what has been happening around here. It
 started a few weeks ago when a perfectly preserved corpse of some kind of
 creature was found in our diamond mines. Our miners reported it to the
 guards, who went to investigate. Shortly after that, the guards that went
 there started acting strangely. At first, they were just keeping to
 themselves and not talking to anyone else, but it wasn't long before they
 started bullying the citizens!"
Contessa exclaims, "Now, they are building something in the upper part of
 the cathedral, and they won't let anyone in to see what they are doing.
 They won't even let me look, saying that it's unsafe for a person of my
 rank in the church!"
Contessa exclaims, "I want you to see what they are up to, and stop what
 they are doing!"

  Closing your eyes, you jump down the hole.  After speeding towards the

For some reason this reminds you of "Alice in Wonderland" when Alice jumps

you see sky below you.  SKY?!  You could have SWORN that you were just in a

shield your face with your hand, hoping that you can block out the radiance.
The light is so pure that it hurts even a powerful adventurer such as you.

You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ...

  This entire part of the castle is composed of solid sheets of polished 
diamonds, which would be impossible without the use of powerful magic. The 
way that light reflects off of the smooth multifaceted surfaces gives them an
almost-ethereal appearance, as though the walls weren't solid and you could 
reach through them. The near-perfect impression of the walls is only at the 
surface, because if you look closely, a few minute cracks that are filled 
with a sickly green color in the otherwise flawless surfaces can be seen.

Inside Diamond Castle
  The diamond walls of the corridor open up into a huge ante chamber here,
and you gaze up at the almost endless ceiling.  Tiny points of light dot the
top of the large dome in the ceiling, and you get the sensation that the
energy of the stars themselves are being funneled into the castle.  Indeed,
you feel like some kind of cosmic force is protecting you from harm.  Unlike
the light of the stars, however, the light is somewhat chilly, almost as if
it has been corrupted.  The sensation increases as you head north, towards
the jail, but decreases as you go south towards the portal room.  The throne
room is far ahead of you, a long way to the east.

  Two tapestries woven of pure silken threads grace the diamond walls of
the hallway, each depicting a turning point of not just the castle, but of
the whole city as well.  Crystalline suits of armor line the walls,
absorbing the light then dispersing it in a prismatic spiral.  The
chandelier hanging from the ceiling has no candles with which to
illuminate the corridor, yet it gives off a tranquil radiance which urges
you to release all your pent up hatreds and phobias.  Your eyelids slowly
drift downwards as you fall into a deep healing trance.  Here, above all
other places, you feel safe.

  After opening the diamond gate and entering the castle, your senses are
overcome with amazement and wonder.  Even the inner walls of this
magnificent castle are made of diamond.  As you step across the floor, the
shock of your feet smacking the ground is absorbed, and instead of making a
cacophonous sound, you hear a soft bell chiming in the distance.  It seems
as if the destructive sound energy is converted into a harmonious melody. 
You sigh in utter bliss as you realize that nothing will hurt you here ... 
provided you treat it well.  To your north is a diamond fence which
separates the rest of the castle from the arborium, and to the south is the
castle dining room.  The castle hallway continues east.

Inside a strange city
  Closing your eyes, you jump down the hole.  After speeding towards the
ground at terminal velocity for several minutes, you suddenly screech to a
near halt and find yourself floating very gently and gracefully downwards. 
For some reason this reminds you of "Alice in Wonderland" when Alice jumps
down the rabbit's hole.  After almost an hour of floating like a feather,
you see sky below you.  SKY?!  You could have SWORN that you were just in a
cave.  Yet here you are, falling down towards a sky and a sparkling city
below.  The sun gleams off all the buildings, spiralling reds, blues,
purples, and colors you don't even have names for in all directions.  As you
touch ground for the first time in ages, you find yourself in the midst of
this strange underground city of sky and crystal.

crystal which you quickly recognize as being aquamarine.  A holy energy

all the evil in his heart.  How touching!  This place, unlike some of the

is quite an effort; it is like swimming a sea of blue honey.  Strangely
enough, you don't feel the need to go to the surface for air; this is a
good thing, because the ocean seems to continue for many leagues both above
and below you.  After several hours of swimming without seeing any

Approaching a small mining camp
  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.  

[ Exits: south up ]
     A fresh oak sign protrudes from the charred ground.
Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew
silently. After a minute or two she spots you.
Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

  Still a bit groggy from your difficult journey (and because you've just
recovered from passing out) you feel extremely disoriented, and in fact
almost feel like you have to pass out again.  Harnessing all your strength
and all your will, you manage to fight off the urge.  Who knows WHERE you
might end up if you were to fall unconscious again!  After the dizzy
spell passes, you notice that you are inside a small mining settlement that
has mysteriously sprung up by the mountain.  The ground beneath your feet is
composed of a dark brown substance that is similar to dirt, but feels a bit
more squishy beneath your feet.  What strikes you most of all, however, is
the fact that no one seems to be happy.  They are too concerned with making
money, many having presumably left behind their wives and children in hopes
of making a quick gold coin.

you still have no answers.  The smell of fresh blood wafts in from the

wrinkle your nose at the prospect of seeing another dead body (even the most

rotting carcass).  You can also travel east or west to what you hope is a

You wake up on Medical beds, then stand up.
Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  A raging dust storm swirls about the base of the mountain, piercing your
weathered eyes with its ungodly strength.  You grit your teeth against the
pain and struggle onward, hoping the storm will soon cease.  The side of the
mountain to your east is as black as charred flesh and there are no green
plants to lend color or life to the scene.  The wind does not let up, and
you hasten to find some kind of shelter.  May this forsaken place be forever
damned.

Beatrice the adventurer walks about here, scaling the mountain.
Beatrice sits down on a large rock, takes a sandwich out of her backpack, and begins to chew

Beatrice asks, "Hi, I'm Beatrice. Who are you?"
You tell Beatrice that your name is KumoGami.
Beatrice asks, "Nice to meet you, KumoGami. Perhaps you would like to know
 more about Sargasso?"

Just outside Sargasso
  The dark granite encompasses the area as far as your eye can see.  You
begin to feel cold, scared, and claustrophobic as its proverbial weight
crushes your chest, leaving you with no room to breathe.  You gasp for air
and your pulse begins racing ...  Harder and harder you reach out, trying to
grasp at the heavy air that you know is there but that you just can't touch.
You race forward, panicked, and suddenly pass out ...  

When you come to, you are at the wooden gate of some strange mining
settlement.  Very few people are around, but for some reason that does not
strike you as being very strange.  Looking to the north, you notice that the
mountain has closed behind you, leaving behind no trace of the dust storm
or of the smell of burnt flesh.  You have no choice but to continue onward.

Inside a small mine shaft
  Rotting oak posts support the ceiling of this very old looking mine
shaft.  You find this to be very strange, because all the other clues point
to the fact that Sargasso is a relatively new settlement.  How odd.  Maybe
there's something more to the mineshaft ...  something beautiful, yet
forgotten for countless ages.  The upper level of the mine shaft continues
south of here, or you can explore the depths of the mine below.

Exploring underground
  This mine shaft is certainly much bigger than you thought it would be! 
It appears that the Sargasso miners certainly found a bit more than ore when
they dug deep inside the ground.  The underground caverns seem almost
endless, and you can't help but notice that they seem to be very ancient,
unlike the relatively new mine shaft.  You can climb back up the rope to the
mining settlement, but you get the feeling that it would be much nicer to
explore underground instead.  Paths spiral off in each direction, and you
really don't know which would be the best way to go.  Tiny little runes are
carved inside one of the cavern's walls in runny black ink.  Maybe coming to
Sargasso wasn't such a huge waste after all.

Exploring underground
  Even though you are still relatively close to the Sargasso mineshaft, you
cannot believe how different this place is from the accursed town.  Whereas
Sargasso had almost nothing but horror and evil, the underground has a
mysterious quality.  You don't know exactly how to catergorize it: sometimes
the cavern gives off a feeling of warmth and light, other times you cringe
in fear, wondering if your own shadow has turned against you.  Bowing your
head slightly, you utter a quick prayer to your god, asking him to protect
you.  The tunnel opens up into a huge chamber here, and by the way the dust
flies around the opening you can tell that some entity passed through here
quite recently.

Exploring underground
  Even though you are still relatively close to the Sargasso mineshaft, you
cannot believe how different this place is from the accursed town.  Whereas
Sargasso had almost nothing but horror and evil, the underground has a
mysterious quality.  You don't know exactly how to catergorize it: sometimes
the cavern gives off a feeling of warmth and light, other times you cringe
in fear, wondering if your own shadow has turned against you.  Bowing your
head slightly, you utter a quick prayer to your god, asking him to protect
you.  The tunnel opens up into a huge chamber here, and by the way the dust
flies around the opening you can tell that some entity passed through here
quite recently.

Exploring underground
  Clank, clank, clank.  In the distance you hear iron weapons being
sharpened on the granite walls of the cave, and you worry that you might be
ambushed somewhere ...  But where?  You start thinking that the more you
travel in these strange lands the more questions pop into your head - but
you still have no answers.  The smell of fresh blood wafts in from the
south, and you question the wisdom of travelling in that direction.  You
wrinkle your nose at the prospect of seeing another dead body (even the most
bloodthirsty of warriors has an occasional pang of guilt when seeing a
rotting carcass).  You can also travel east or west to what you hope is a
safer part of the tunnel.

Exploring underground
  The twists and turns of the cavern having completely aggravated you, you
decide to take it easy for a while.  Sitting down on the cold granite floor,
you doze off for a tiny bit, thinking that a little bit of rest is what you
need to clear your mind in the hopes that you can find some way out of this
truly irksome place ...
 You wake up with a jolt as you feel a sharp pain in your left leg.  Your
eyes pierce the darkness and you see two semi-humanoid creatures, each about
1 meter tall.  They unsheath what appears to be a wavy serrated sword and
point it at your throat, demanding all your money.  You sit there,
dumbfounded, and ponder your next move.

  You find yet another dead end in this very strange yet exciting cavern. 
The granite walls are soft to the touch - they feel like a goose down pillow
feels after weeks of hard travelling.  Some massive erosion must have taken
place for the walls to get like this, but you can't help but wonder exactly
HOW.  After all, this mine shaft was constructed fairly recently, so it
would be silly to think that someone could actually be LIVING down here ...

Exploring underground
  Even though you are still relatively close to the Sargasso mineshaft, you
cannot believe how different this place is from the accursed town.  Whereas
Sargasso had almost nothing but horror and evil, the underground has a
mysterious quality.  You don't know exactly how to catergorize it: sometimes
the cavern gives off a feeling of warmth and light, other times you cringe
in fear, wondering if your own shadow has turned against you.  Bowing your
head slightly, you utter a quick prayer to your god, asking him to protect
you.  The tunnel opens up into a huge chamber here, and by the way the dust
flies around the opening you can tell that some entity passed through here
quite recently.

Exploring underground
  This mine shaft is certainly much bigger than you thought it would be! 
It appears that the Sargasso miners certainly found a bit more than ore when
they dug deep inside the ground.  The underground caverns seem almost
endless, and you can't help but notice that they seem to be very ancient,
unlike the relatively new mine shaft.  You can climb back up the rope to the
mining settlement, but you get the feeling that it would be much nicer to
explore underground instead.  Paths spiral off in each direction, and you
really don't know which would be the best way to go.  Tiny little runes are
carved inside one of the cavern's walls in runny black ink.  Maybe coming to
Sargasso wasn't such a huge waste after all.

Inside a small mine shaft
  Rotting oak posts support the ceiling of this very old looking mine
shaft.  You find this to be very strange, because all the other clues point
to the fact that Sargasso is a relatively new settlement.  How odd.  Maybe
there's something more to the mineshaft ...  something beautiful, yet
forgotten for countless ages.  The upper level of the mine shaft continues
south of here, or you can explore the depths of the mine below.

Inside a small mine shaft
  Rotting oak posts support the ceiling of this very old looking mine
shaft.  You find this to be very strange, because all the other clues point
to the fact that Sargasso is a relatively new settlement.  How odd.  Maybe
there's something more to the mineshaft ...  something beautiful, yet
forgotten for countless ages.  The upper level of the mine shaft continues
south of here, or you can explore the depths of the mine below.

The great city of Cineko
  An entire city floating on the clouds?! What a sight! There are exits in all 
directions, leading to various parts of the city. The air here is thin, 
making it a bit hard to breathe. It is dark here at night, since there is no

clouds holding their foundations. To the south appears to be an intersection.

A cloudy intersection
  Clouds seem to come to a sudden intersection here, providing exits in nearly 
all directions. There's a large, darker cloud to the north preventing travel 
in that direction. The residential area of the city spans east and west, 
while the rest of the city lies to the south. In the daytime, the sun can be 
a bit overwhelming. You assume the residents of the city have adapted to 
this.

A cloudy intersection
  Clouds seem to come to a sudden intersection here, providing exits in nearly 
all directions. There's a large, darker cloud to the north preventing travel 
in that direction. The residential area of the city spans east and west, 
while the rest of the city lies to the south. In the daytime, the sun can be 
a bit overwhelming. You assume the residents of the city have adapted to 
this.

  Your feet slowly sink into the cloud as you walk across it. If it were not 
for some magical flying spell, you would definitely fall through, hitting the
ground with a fatal thud. Large, thick clouds prevent travel to the east or 
west, and to the north some what appears to be residential buildings can be 
seen. This cloud continues to the south as well.

  This city really is an amazing, imaginative feat. Who would've ever thought 
to build a city in the sky? How long has this city been here, unnoticed? To 
the north, some buildings can be seen, supported by large, fluffy white 
clouds holding their foundations. To the south appears to be an intersection.

  An entire city floating on the clouds?! What a sight! There are exits in all 
directions, leading to various parts of the city. The air here is thin, 
making it a bit hard to breathe. It is dark here at night, since there is no 
electricity in the sky. In the daytime, though, the sun is almost too much to
bear. Sounds are coming from all directions, indicating abundant life within 
the city.

In a strong updraft
  The air is swirling around you, while lifting you up into the air. Small 
twigs, branches and other debris seems to have been caught in the 'storm'.
You begin to wonder where this is leading. Looking upwards, nothing much can 
be seen except clouds and sky.

  The updraft seems to be weakening slightly as it continues upward, but not 
strong enough to drop anything caught to the bottom, probably killing them 
instantly. A small glimmer of a city can be seen above. Is it possible? A 
city in the sky? What a marvel that would be. More debris swirls around you 
as you continue towards the city.

  As the air is beginning to slow down, one can only assume this is the end of 
the updraft. The air is barely strong enough to support you floating in spot 
now, so you better hurry up and move along. A large city lies above, floating
in the clouds. Although possible, you could go back down if you wish to not 
enter the city.

The great city of Cineko
  An entire city floating on the clouds?! What a sight! There are exits in all 
directions, leading to various parts of the city. The air here is thin, 
making it a bit hard to breathe. It is dark here at night, since there is no 
electricity in the sky. In the daytime, though, the sun is almost too much to
bear. Sounds are coming from all directions, indicating abundant life within 
the city.

[ Exits: north east south west down ]
     A directional sign shows the main sectors of the city.
     A rain cloud provides an endless source of water to the residents.
A citizen of the great city is walking around, floating above the clouds.

Southern clouds
  The clouds supporting you here seem to be much sturdier than those in other 
parts of the city. You suspect this path leads to an important part of the 
city. You can see a good amount of buildings to the south, all floating 
magically on fluffy white clouds. There's a large intersection to the north.

  You can now clearly see large buildings to the southwest. To the south, the 
path through the clouds makes a sharp turn to the west, where the buildings 
have been constructed. You assume these are administrative buildings for the 
city, built to help keep the city infrastructure running smoothly. The rest 
of the city lies to the north.

  What's a city without its administrative sector? A non-healthy city. You see 
four or five buildings from this vantage point, some of them two stories 
tall, stretching high into the sky. It's amazing the clouds beneath them can 
support their weight! To the east lies the cityguard's building. North will 
take you back into the city and west leads deeper into the administrative 
section.

  You can't help but notice how alive this city is, and how healthily it is being
operated. Is the mayor responsible for this? Or is it his staff? Regardless, 
if they keep up with their ways the city will be healthy for many more years 
to come. A jailhouse lies to the north and the mayor's manor lies to the 
south. This cloudly path runs east and west.

  This must be the mayor of the city's house. It is very distinctive, with gold
trimmed columns and marble walls. The door to the north is always open, 
creating a welcoming atmosphere. Being the mayor of such a beautiful and 
peaceful city must be a pretty sweet job to have. The exit north leads back 
into the city administrative sector.

  This is quite a sight for anyone to see; flowers glowing on top of clouds.
There must be some sort of magic at work here to make that happen. Flowers 
need soil, water, and tender loving care. Yet, without all these things, they
thrive here. The exit north leads back to the city, south heads into the

Syntax: invsort [sortby] ([container])
        sortby options - type, name, level, wear, weight

The 'invsort' command allows you to view your main inventory, or items 
inside a container, in a sorted format. The sort can be by level, by item 
name, by wear location, or by item type.

When items are sorted by type or wear location, the secondary sort is by
item level.  When items are sorted by level, the item levels are shown even
if the 'noobjlevel' config option is on.

To see the sorted list without the line break, add the 'nolines' option.

Note: 
The invsort command is not complete. Planned additions are sorting by item
points, the ability to actually re-order inventory based on the output and
the ability to view only a single wear location or type.

        wearable                 : Lists wear locations.

To gain the benefits of an item, you must 'wear' it.  You may not be able
to wear an item if it is too heavy, you are too inexperienced, or it is an
opposing alignment.

'wear all' will attempt to wear all items in inventory.  The first item
from your inventory which fills an empty wear slot, will go in that slot.

Many wearable items offer resistances and/or stats.  Some also offer item
affects- see 'help nofail' for more information.

Some wear-locations are duplicated (for example, wearing two items on the
neck or something on each hand) and may (eventually) vary from player to
player.  You can see the different wear locations available to you with the
'wearable' command.  Items may be worn to a particular slot by using 'wear
<item> <wear-keyword>' (e.g., 'wear chain neck2').

Some commands use wear flags for sorting options; this is visible in the
last column of 'wearable'.

Harkening back to the powers of Vlad the Impaler, a weapon with the vampiric
flag has the ability to remove hit points from the target and bestow them 
upon the wielder.  This regenerative ability is powered by particularly dark
forces, and this darkness will slowly corrupt those who prosper from it.

This ability is very similar to the mage spell 'vampiric touch'.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

  You stand in Fairdeal Alley just east of Meridian Square.  The light has

Looking around at the people occupying the alley, you notice that the people
seem friendly.  Perhaps a little too friendly.  While there is no reason to
be suspicious, a nagging feeling gnaws at the pit of your stomach.

Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more

antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where

Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time

  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and

antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:

tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the

Welcome to Grandmarket Boulevard! (G)
  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

  You stand in Fairdeal Alley just east of Meridian Square.  The light has
dimmed as you stand in the shadows of the spires that tower over the city. 
Looking around at the people occupying the alley, you notice that the people

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

She is speaking with a troll who is testing the feel of a blade in his hand.
Many daggers, swords, flails, and maces sit in racks all neatly organized
for customer access.  A trellis covers this platform, supported by beams
based at each of the four corners.  Various staves and polearms are
suspended from the trellis by large hooks.  A ramp to the north will take

Aylorian Elemental Designs
  An old brain teaser asks, "What weighs more, a ton of feathers or a ton
of lead?"  At Aylorian Elemental Designs the answer is, "Which can you
afford to make weigh more?"  These powerful elemental mages have been
disregarding the physics of mass times acceleration for generations!  This
section of the shopette platform is lined with a collection of odd items,
and the elementalists shout for the edification of the crowd: "Come!  See
the feather that weighs as much as a boulder!  See the anvil that is lighter

The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

The Grand Plaza
  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza
  A giant arch marks the western entrance to the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
When the city was young, an observer at Meridian Square could look to the
west and watch the sun disappear through the arch. But, as Aylor grew,
buildings sprang up to block the way.  Still the arch remains, a remnant of
the forerunners who built the greatest city Andolor has known.  Though the
bustle of the market is all around, the Sunset Arch is a place to remember
those who have gone before, and to meditate on friends and loved ones who
have moved on.  When the arch was built, it was simple and unadorned, but
over the years its surface has become covered with countless names carved
into the rock.  Some are fresh, jagged scars, others worn to near
illegibility, but the stone remembers them all.

  Few people linger long on this stretch of Fairdeal Alley.  An almost
palpable feeling of malevolence and danger makes all but the bravest (or
most despicable) of adventurers feel uncomfortable.  Rather than admire
the sights, most choose to move west toward the raucous comforts of Ivar's
Pub, or east to Meridian Square.  Still, there is enough traffic to
suggest that, in spite of the danger, a cautious adventurer may discover a
few things of interest here...

IVAR'S -- The Red Room
  The decor here explains why they call it the Red Room.  Plush crimson
carpet so thick your feet sink in more than an inch covers every square inch
of floor, and the red walls are swathed in scarlet draperies that glitter
with golden thread.  Those serving drinks probably appreciate the footing--
they don't have footwear to go with their skimpy red outfits and ruby
jewelry.  Even the felt that covers the blackjack table is a soft cherry
red.  It's noisy and red hot in here too, bodies packed in rising the
ambient temperature, and occasionally tempers fire up too, so it's probably
best to keep one's weapon at hand.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  Standing in the back of the Temple of Aylor, one can truly appreciate
its unique structure and design.  The white marble walls and floor blend
together, accented by black pews, altar, and pulpit.  The blood-red candles
around the room seem calming but almost foreboding.  The windows, accented
in gold, are brightly painted to portray handsome yet intimidating scenes.
A large, white and gold statue of a man monuments the front of the room. 
The statue stands taller than 20 feet in the temple's vaulted ceiling.

The temple's altar stands to the north, with the exit into Aylor to the south. 
A small black doorway stands in the distance to the west.

that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to

Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

  This is the entrance to a beautiful garden commune.  There are many birds
singing, and butterflies fill the air, occasionally landing on bright, vivid
tulips.  The sun is shining down in visible rays that make the place look
altogether more holy.  It's amazing that Ivar would have such a holy and
marvelous place associated with his temple.  Perhaps it is 'for the ladies'.

overhead, made of the same squishy material as the stairs and safety 
membrane. This object is quickly recognizable as a giant-sized replica of a

Syntax: scribe <spell name>

Scribe is a skill which allows you to prepare written scrolls for later use.

To scribe a spell you need to have:

* A blank scroll - available at Mayvor's Mystic Mastery in Aylor city 
  (runto scrolls).
* The ability to cast the scribed spell.
* Enough mana to cover the cost of inscribing the spell which is 4 times 
  the amount of mana require to cast it normally. 

The level of the written spell will be 5 levels below your current level.

Intelligence and luck will help in scribing, particularly once you get to 
the second and third spell on a single scroll.  It takes a high degree of 
mental training to fit multiple spells on a scroll.

Members of the Enchanter subclass have a better chance of scribing scrolls
with multiple spells than other classes.

Primary stat: Intelligence, Wisdom.
Affected by : Luck.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza
  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

  People, creatures, specters, animals.  The streets are overloaded with
everything capable of motion.  Handheld carts and men on horses push blindly
through the crowd with little sympathy for those in their way.  What could
possibly be found here worth all this hassle?  Do you dare give up looking
before you find out?

>>   *[NOEXP]* The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more

and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  A giant arch marks the western entrance to the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
When the city was young, an observer at Meridian Square could look to the
west and watch the sun disappear through the arch. But, as Aylor grew,
buildings sprang up to block the way.  Still the arch remains, a remnant of
the forerunners who built the greatest city Andolor has known.  Though the
bustle of the market is all around, the Sunset Arch is a place to remember
those who have gone before, and to meditate on friends and loved ones who
have moved on.  When the arch was built, it was simple and unadorned, but
over the years its surface has become covered with countless names carved
into the rock.  Some are fresh, jagged scars, others worn to near
illegibility, but the stone remembers them all.

  Starlight Way continues to the east and west through the grand City of
Aylor.  To the north, you can smell the fresh baked goods of the bakery and
hear the distinct metal-on-metal sound of weapons being tested before
purchase.  The sounds of the armorer announcing his goods also hail from
the north.  This district of town is full of young adventurers haggling for
the best prices on well crafted materials.  In the distance, the solemn
echoes of church bells provide a deep harmony.

  There is something enchanting about walking along the night sky in the middle
of the day, as you continue down the starry path. To the east, you hear the 
bustling activities of adventurers doing their business, purchasing wares, 
and selling off the gains of their toils. Above the clatter you hear someone 
say in a prominent voice, "What?? I don't get it!". The rich smells of breads
and pies fill the air. In the distance, you hear the faint sound of drunken 
dwarves singing.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley

pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes

Whitewind Avenue (G)
  You stand on Whitewind Avenue before a large intersection with a massive
statue and numerous people.  The city around you is incredible, with amazing
architecture, breathtaking horizons, and finely crafted roadwork.  Beneath
your feet, the road is made of a white translucent stone, likely quartz,
that sparkles in the sunlight.  To the north, the grand Aylorian Temple
stands high above the city.

  As the air is beginning to slow down, one can only assume this is the end of 
the updraft. The air is barely strong enough to support you floating in spot 
now, so you better hurry up and move along. A large city lies above, floating
in the clouds. Although possible, you could go back down if you wish to not 
enter the city.

  The stairway spirals to the right, and visibility is reduced to only a

  You stand at the bottom of a flight of spiral stairs.  To the south a

warm, but you are surprised to notice the faint hint of moisture in the air!
Perhaps there is an underground spring around somewhere.

  What's a city without its administrative sector? A non-healthy city. You see 
four or five buildings from this vantage point, some of them two stories 
tall, stretching high into the sky. It's amazing the clouds beneath them can 
support their weight! To the east lies the cityguard's building. North will 
take you back into the city and west leads deeper into the administrative

sweeps through the warehouse, taking with it the potentially toxic vapors 
omitted while creating magical potions. These toxins are swept to the east, 
away from the city and potential harm to its residents. This warehouse 
extends south and west.

A magical warehouse
  Questions are starting to get answered as you explore the city, in particular
the industrial sector, seeing what is made and they use their products for.
There are magical item making materials scattered all around this warehouse.
You deduce, from the word 'fly' being on the side of most everything, this is
where the fly spell is created for all the residents of the city, to never 
have to worry about falling to their deaths. The warehouse exit is to the 
south, and the factory stretches east and north.

A storage facility
  You accidentally step on a box when entering the room, and the contents 
inside make a crunching sound. You look around hoping nobody saw this, but 
nobody is here. More cobwebs can be seen, so you assume spiders have made 
this building their home. The facility continues north and west.

  This building is obviously used for storage purposes only, as you see no sign
of human life coming or going from this building. There are unlabeled boxes 
in nearly each nook and cranny in the building. The torches hanging from the 
ceiling are unlit, and need to be exchanged for new ones. The exit from the 
facility is to the north.

  You've reached the southern end of the industrial area of the city. Yet 
another building lies to the south, although you can't quite tell what is 
going on inside. There's also a building to the west, from which smoke is 
pouring from the doorway. Finally, a building lies to the east which appears 
foggy to the naked eye.

  Yet another building has appeared to the east, built on top another white 
fluffy cloud. You're starting to get used to this after seeing so many 
buildings floating on top of clouds. A strange, white mist seems to be coming
from the entrance to the building. This cloudy walkway continues north and 
south.

  This has to be one of the busiest industrial parks you've seen in your life.
Buildings surround you in almost every direction, except east. A barrier has 
been constructed into the cloud somehow to keep you from traveling in that 
direction. The cloud path continues north and south, while the western path 
leads back to the main city.

  The air here seems quite clean, despite the fact you are standing in the 
heart of the industrial district of the city. Could this be even more magic 
to keep the wind blowing in a certain direction? Two buildings have been 
constructed on clouds north and south of here, although their contents cannot
be seen from this vantage point. There's a large intersection east, while the
main city lies to the west.

  The wind increases dramatically as you step onto the cloud in the industrial 
sector of the city. You assume this wind is blowing east to help keep the 
smog away from the city itself. Two factories lie directly to the north and 
south. Heavy smoke is billowing from the southern factory, while the northern
one appears clean. This cloud continues east and west.

  The clouds beneath your feet seem to thicken as you get closer to the 
industrial buildings. You assume this is because more dense clouds are needed
to keep these heavy buildings in the sky. The lighter clouds stretch 
westward, leading back to the main intersection of the city.

it's clear as day (pun intended). There seems to be some sort of industrial 
park type sector to the east. To the west, the main city intersection lies.

  An entire city floating on the clouds?! What a sight! There are exits in all

making it a bit hard to breathe. It is dark here at night, since there is no 
electricity in the sky. In the daytime, though, the sun is almost too much to
bear. Sounds are coming from all directions, indicating abundant life within 
the city.

able to advance any further. Citizens, residents, and visitors often stroll

see no janitors walking around. This rainbow extends to the west, while a 
large intersection is to the east.

floating in the air display the latest makings for sale, only available here

A Long and Dusty Paved Road
  The cracked sun bleached paving stones of this ancient road have
given way to a more level and repaired stretch of footbeaten rock.  The
sands blowing across the roadway have not yet erased the faint signs of work
done to maintain and repair this desolate strand of path, this desert road
that twists and turns among the uncaring sands.  You press on, into the
glare of the mid afternoon sun.

A Carefully Maintained Road
  The road here is as well maintained as it is abandoned to your west. 
The sands are held at bay with a cunning wall of stone, which gives the rock
of the road the appearance of a great causeway rising above the harsh and
merciless sands of the desert.  To your east you can barely make out through
the blinding sun some sort of intersection defying the soft curves that the
desert would seem to prefer.

  The road is wider here as it approaches the intersection before you. 
You can see more clearly now that what you took for mountains in the
distance, seen hazily through the slow moving desert air, is in fact the
spires and towers of a great city rising before you.  To your west the
desert slowly drinks in the concrete river of the road you travel on.  To
your east it meets another road in a great intersection.

Well Travelled Crossroads
  The road you have been following through the desert has arrived at a
great intersection, carved from the rock and the sands that seem to make up
most of this place.  A rusting iron cage hangs forlornly from a graying
wooden pole, squeaking in the harsh acid wind that blows across the sandy
wastes about you.  A few sullen vultures sit upon the pole, regarding you
strangely as you peer into the rusting iron of the cage and notice bleached
bones and rags that tell of past meals for these scavengers of the sky. 
Sand blasted expanses of road lead off in all directions, and along the one
to your east you can see the hazy spires of a mighty city thrusting upwards
from its sandy base.

A Road Leading Towards a Fortress
  This road has been laid with an almost fanatical precision.  The stone
blocks are lined evenly, and completely flat despite the gentle curve of the
hill.  To your south a rising wall set with crenelations and towers marks
the entrance to a small fortress that seemingly guards the wastes outside
Reme.  To your north a crossroads marks the desert sands.

Astra Road
  You walk along the east/west running Astra road, admiring the various
guilds of Reme.  This section appears to house the guilds of Warriors and
Mages, at least this is what the signs seem to indicate.  To your north a
painted sword and shield hang from a wooden post, and to your south a
glowing symbol of an open hand floats mysteriously in mid air.  Astra road
continues to the west and east.

Octavian Square
  This white square is composed of thousands of slabs of the purest marble,
laid cunningly end to end.  In the centre, a pedestal rises from the marbled
ground, with carvings of palm leaves and olive branches decorating the
sides.  From this pedestal a tall white statue rises, of a man in his
middle years with a regal bearing.  His cold stare tells that well the
sculptor his passions read, as he stares beyond the walls of Reme.  A small
plaque at the statue's feet reads simply 'Emperor Octavian.'  Roadways lead
from here in all directions.

Well Travelled Crossroads
  The road you have been following through the desert has arrived at a
great intersection, carved from the rock and the sands that seem to make up
most of this place.  A rusting iron cage hangs forlornly from a graying
wooden pole, squeaking in the harsh acid wind that blows across the sandy
wastes about you.  A few sullen vultures sit upon the pole, regarding you
strangely as you peer into the rusting iron of the cage and notice bleached
bones and rags that tell of past meals for these scavengers of the sky. 
Sand blasted expanses of road lead off in all directions, and along the one

those weary travellers to their thirsty doom.  A cracked and ancient road
rides through the wastes like a bridge over a troubled sea, twisting on
motionless waves of sand until it disappears into the haze of the east.  
A small weather beaten and blasted marker sits half buried by the all

Fahreem's Tent
  As you bend over to pass into this dark little merchant's tent along the
great Reman bazaar, you immediately are hit by the strong smell of a
strange and wonderful incense.  As you straighten and your eyes grow more
accustomed to the dim lighting, you notice that many strange and curious
goods line the walls of the linen tent, and indeed the tent seems to be lit
by their glow!  Fahreem must be a dealer in magic!

The Square of the Bazaar
  Your head is definitely hurting now from the noise of the massive crowd
around you.  Women, men and children barter at every tent and table for
every imaginable item in the chaos that is the great Reman Bazaar.  Stalls
line every inch of square, with brightly coloured tents taking up the space
along the edges.  Storekeepers wander by dressed in exotic silks and linens,
while nobles and commoners alike wander by in awe.  Welcome to the square of
the Bazaar.

composure and sanity.  The crowd that gawks in every booth and at every
wonder adds its own special noises and smells to this wonderful chaos, that
is the Bazaar at Reme.

Inside the Great Gates
  You have passed through the great polished bronze gates of Reme, into a
city that is as splendid as the legends say.  Great domes crown the
buildings of white marble, and silver mouldings show scenes from legends
along the tops of walls all over the city.  It indeed must be a blinding
sight during sunrise and sunset.  You can see roads running to your north

A Small and Dirty Road
  This road is far more dingy and dirty than most in mighty Reme.  Up ahead
you see the dismal shape of various slum apartments rising from the squalor
of the street below.  Clearly this leads to the poorer section of town.

>>   *[NOEXP]* Charity Lane
  This aptly named street is the center of housing for the servants of
Reme, as well as anyone else who is of 'lesser means'.  The apartments
rising to your left and right show signs of being hastily and shabbily
constructed.  Rats forage among piles of garbage in the streets and children
play with bits of trash pulled from the nobility's garbage.  The road
continues to your north and south.

  You stand outside a particularly bad example of the housing used by the
lower classes of Reme.  The front door, once merely inadequate now has
reached new heights in kindling.  Children play in the dirt of a empty lot
beside the building, and the wide open door almost seems to invite entry to
the east.

Charity Lane
  The street has become quiet all of a sudden.  You notice everyone is
walking across the street from you, seemingly to avoid a small dark store
which is simply labelled as 'Curios' on a plain timeworn sign hanging from a
rusty nail upon its door.  You notice whispers and looks of fear and
scratch your head as you stare at what seems to you to just be another
business on the verge of going under.  

[ Exits: north south west ]
A barbarian saunters past you.

  This store was once merely another marginal business in the poor section
of Reme.  Now that it has closed though, a seedier element has taken over
its bare shelves and adapted it to their own sinister purposes.  It appears
a gang of muggers has taken over this space, and you just interrupted them
in the counting of their loot.  You notice VERY malevolent glares from them,
and prepare your weapons.

  The street has become quiet all of a sudden.  You notice everyone is
walking across the street from you, seemingly to avoid a small dark store
which is simply labelled as 'Curios' on a plain timeworn sign hanging from a
rusty nail upon its door.  You notice whispers and looks of fear and
scratch your head as you stare at what seems to you to just be another
business on the verge of going under.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

Recreation Room (G)
  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the

The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

heart of the industrial district of the city. Could this be even more magic

A magical warehouse
  There's a large, wooden table here in the center of this room. It is holding 
flasks filled with various, multicolored liquids; some bubbling, others 
boiling. These concoctions are completely monitored, and the process of 
making the spell has been completely mastered throughout the years. The 
warehouse continues north and west.

  Questions are starting to get answered as you explore the city, in particular
the industrial sector, seeing what is made and they use their products for.
There are magical item making materials scattered all around this warehouse.
You deduce, from the word 'fly' being on the side of most everything, this is
where the fly spell is created for all the residents of the city, to never 
have to worry about falling to their deaths. The warehouse exit is to the 
south, and the factory stretches east and north.

  You've reached the northern end of the industrial sector. There are three 
very large buildings surrounding you. The factory to the west is involved in 
making torches for the great city, the warehouse to the north provides flying
abilities for the city's residents and citizens, but you can't tell from here
what the building to the east is for. You do see two huge objects on top of 
it, though. The industrial sector continues to the south.

Administrative sector
  What's a city without its administrative sector? A non-healthy city. You see 
four or five buildings from this vantage point, some of them two stories 
tall, stretching high into the sky. It's amazing the clouds beneath them can 
support their weight! To the east lies the cityguard's building. North will 
take you back into the city and west leads deeper into the administrative 
section.

  You can't help but notice how alive this city is, and how healthily it is being
operated. Is the mayor responsible for this? Or is it his staff? Regardless, 
if they keep up with their ways the city will be healthy for many more years 
to come. A jailhouse lies to the north and the mayor's manor lies to the 
south. This cloudly path runs east and west.

  This must be the mayor of the city's house. It is very distinctive, with gold
trimmed columns and marble walls. The door to the north is always open, 
creating a welcoming atmosphere. Being the mayor of such a beautiful and 
peaceful city must be a pretty sweet job to have. The exit north leads back 
into the city administrative sector.

  This is quite a sight for anyone to see; flowers glowing on top of clouds.
There must be some sort of magic at work here to make that happen. Flowers 
need soil, water, and tender loving care. Yet, without all these things, they
thrive here. The exit north leads back to the city, south heads into the 
mayor's house, and this courtyard extends east and west.

The mayor's house
  The elaborate craftsmanship that went into building this house can take the

mayor likes it. She must be a wealthy individual. Exits in all directions

courtyard.

  The airship docks, and gnomes scurry around preparing for disembarkment.

  As you stand at the entrance to the cathedral, you see amazing
architecture and masonry craftsmanship that emit a sense of primordial power. 
However the gnomes appear to have mixed in technology with magic to create
this cathedral.  The bell hovers in midair, supported by a contraption.  The
exterior of the chapel is made of stone.  Gears and gadgets are carved into
the walls of the cathedral as well as images of their god.  The feeling of
cold that you would normally expect from stone does not exist, but a strange
feeling of warmth radiates from the floors and walls.  Spires rise towards
the heavens and disappear in the clouds.  You feel a cool breeze blow across
your face and angelic singing echoes in your ears as you open the doors.

  This is the residential section of Gnomalin.  The street is made of
several different precious stones fitted together in a pattern that wrenches

home.  The cloud billows as you walk and there is very little noise inside
the swirling walls of the house.  You can see a hallway with several doors
which must lead into the private rooms of the Gnomish inhabitants, and
opposite the hall is a large kitchen.  A fire burns on a hearth made of
stone, which against all physical laws, rests comfortably atop a fluffy
piece of the floor.  A set of stairs lead down into the cloud, though a
complex alarm system guarantees that no visitors such as yourself will climb
down to find out what is there.  There are faint sounds of hammering and
ringing bells coming from below, however, and you guess that it must be a
Gnome's workshop.

The governor's room
  As you ascend the stairs, you come to a pair of double doors.  Throwing
open the doors, you enter the private chambers of the governor.  A large bed
occupies the majority of the room, and appears to be spinning.  Mirrors hang
on the ceiling above the bed.  The nightstand next to the bed holds a
strange device.  As you examine the device, you touch one of the buttons and
soothing melodies begin to play.  A fireplace dominates the western wall. 
The fireplace is lit and provides a romantic setting.  A balcony overlooking
the city is to the south.

  The street comes to an end here.  A large billowing mansion rises to the
north, its spires and towers looking like fanciful creatures as they swirl. 
It is difficult to understand how all these cloudy places can exist, but
then, the jarring effect of the multicolored stones might be playing more
tricks with your mind than you first thought.  A small house sits to the
west, and an official building sits to the east.  The building is out of

to have plenty of places to gather for business.

front of the lecturn with what appears to be wires and hoses which disappear
through one of the cloud-walls.  The writing is crammed together and
extremely small, and reading it would probably give most people a headache

and tiny glitters dance over the surfaces as the shifting cloud causes the

mill about the room talking in hushed voices.  Occasionally someone lets out
a shout of frustration, causing looks of sympathy or annoyance to be cast in
his or her (or its) direction.  A very long queue begins just beyond the

Reception Area (G)
  At the end of the Hallway you see the receptionist sitting behind a large 
desk. A little nameplate on this desk says "Beryl". You now see the reason 
for the very long queue - only one person is available to address the inquiry
of each person in the queue. The receptionist listens to each question or 
request, ponders carefully, and then frequently sends the individual off to 
the absolutely wrong office in the maze of buildings to the north.

[ Exits: north south ]
A short, dumpy little gnome, filled with a sense of self-importance, looks down at you with disdain.

Hallway to Reception
  The gnomes patiently shuffle along, moving slowly towards the reception
area to the north.  This hallway looks like most of the government
facilities you've ever seen, and is less elegant than the entrance.  Dingy
walls are adorned with only official announcements and warnings.  The
ceiling is lower here, but the cloud floor muffles most of the sound.  The
queue has become quieter here as most individuals appear to have decided on
which question to ask the receptionist.

Entrance to the Gnomish Government Building
  You are standing in a large, circular room with a soaring ceiling.  Light
filters down through a large skylight at the center, creating a warm glow
throughout.  The evenly spaced white marble columns around the wall gleam,
and tiny glitters dance over the surfaces as the shifting cloud causes the
light to waver.  Little gnomes, as well as members of various other races,
mill about the room talking in hushed voices.  Occasionally someone lets out
a shout of frustration, causing looks of sympathy or annoyance to be cast in
his or her (or its) direction.  A very long queue begins just beyond the
door, and flows around the wall until it passes under an archway leading to
the hall to the north.

  Compared to the other sections of the bank, this area of the building appears
deserted. One single desk is placed in the middle of the room. An old gnome 
with bottle-bottom glasses sits behind the desk, supervising his workers 
behind the counter. In his hands, he holds a pair of binoculars made out of 
bronze. Occasionally, he scans around the bank through these binoculars, 
which enhance his impaired vision by a large factor. To the west, a half-open
mahogany wooden door leads into a lounge.

  You are in the main section of the bank.  The ceiling here is lower than

lengthy mahogany counter extends from the far left to the far right.  There
are about fifty gnomes sitting behind the counter.  Most of them are old and
frail, but there are a few who will intimidate potential troublemakers.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Dark (G)
  You emerge from a dark haze and find yourself at the shrine. Before you 
stands the statue of Darkness, a shadowy figure that is difficult to focus 
on. Her form is oddly indiscernible, at once haughty and timid, cruel and 
loving. The marble feels cool to the touch, but there is a warm presence 
within that seems to give you the strength to face your enemies once again.
Get out there and get some revenge!

  Taking a seat at the bar, you examine the rows of drinks behind
the counter. The bartender mixes a -Vial oF Dark DeSires-, handing
the drink to a woman in red leather. A man in splendid black orders
another Fading Darkness for himself. The fallen lady in his lap
wraps her arms around him tighter, but gives you a knowing smile.

  Beyond the counter, there seems to be a door hidden in the dark
shadows. A small wiry man sits on a stool nearby, apparently
guarding the portal. The black guard doesn't look to be very 
dangerous, however, even the Shadows on the wall can be deceiving.

  'You will never get in there,' whispers the Darkness. You realize,
too late, that Darkness follows you always.

  Pausing at the entrance to the tavern for a moment, you wait until
your eyes adjust to the darkness. As you step inside the establishment,
two bouncers move to position at the door, blocking the way out. Perhaps
it wasn't such a good idea to seek this Guild's services after all.

  The flickering light from the torches lining the walls barely
illuminates the place. Tavern patrons seated at the wooden tables
regard you grimly before returning to their business. Weapons of death
and all manner of ghastly trophies decorate the walls. Is that fresh
blood dripping from that Bloody collection of Ears?

  A serving wench beckons you into the crowd, but you lose her in the
throng. You feel eyes on you, but attempts to discern the watchers are
unsuccessful. One man appears to be facing your way; then you realize
that a little boy is leading his blind master.

  Suddenly, the shadows shift! The space before you grows dark, and
you see too late the famed Barden's Black Razor drawing blood from your
throat under your chin. Your heart races as Darkness surrounds you.

  'What boon do you ask of The Guild?' whispers the Darkness.

  A black grand piano stands before the fireplace, a pianist playing
as a girl dances and sings for the spectators. The deft fingers of the
musician dance expertly over the keys as the Shadow Dancer performs
for the entertainment of the tavern.

  A drunkard gimps in, bawling along with the refrain, drowning out
the soft voice until a neighbor punches him in the face for disturbing
the dark beauty of the Siren's Song. No one else is drunk enough to try
the same.

  Lying on the bearskin rug by the fire is a large black wolf, with one
eye open to watch the patrons. The creature belongs to someone here or to
the Guild. You have every reason to be cautious of its Prowess if the
latter is true. The wolf seems to grin, the sharp white teeth clearly
visible.

  The floor is cleared for a space large enough for a real fight. The
toppled tables have been pushed aside to the walls, the food and drink
once atop them now in a mess on the floor. You can see dried blood
caked in the grooves between the wood planks in the floor, where
countless other fights have been carried out to Fatal wounds.

  Men cheer, shouting 'Kill! Kill!' as the combatants circle each
other, ready to Maim, Maul, and Murder. One draws a weapon, thinking
he would have the advantage, but others already seem to be gunning for
the blade bearer, evening out the fight in numbers. BloodThirst gleams
in the eyes of those watching, and the fighters themselves know that
at least one among them will be kissed by the Cold Death Angel tonight.
A man in black stares from across the room, the Pitch <O>Black<O> Gaze
piercing the Darkness. If Looks Could Kill... You shiver at the thought.

  You can feel the Gaze of the dark goddess as whispers of death float
through the air. Something falls to the ground - velvet petals and 
sharp thorns - a black rose.

  Then... Darkness claims you.

  Familiar sounds and sights that designate a brothel fill the
anteroom. Incense burners line the walls in small alcoves, and opium
smoke hovers heavily in the air. Several young men take their pleasure
right here in the open, while others watch as the dancers perform. A
girl dressed in white twirls with grace. Beauty and Talent are a
Deadly Combination, and the femme fatales here have them both.

  Screams of Pleasure sound from down the hall, accompanied by the
swish of a whip through the air and the resounding smack. You shiver
with each Echoing Scream; the bound one should have been gagged with
screams like that.

  The candles flicker as the Mistress of the house approaches you, 
making the shadowy silhouettes dance upon the walls. She demands 
payment of you as the one called the Black Widow selects her prey 
for tonight.

  Two strong men are arm-wrestling at a table as spectators call out
their wagers. Arms locked, the two are evenly matched, the outcome
still hazy. An eternity later, the clasped hands move in a direction
and continue dropping to the table, until the loser's hand meets wood.

  As the bystanders cheer and boo and sums of gold are exchanged, a
particularily gorgeous temptress sidles into the lap of the winner,
planting wet Kisses in between his breathless Gasps. With her
encouragement, the Champion beckons the next contender close, the
bastard so sure of the success of his near future.

A Dusty Seabed
  A gust of sand shoots across the desert, buffeted by the dry wind
whistling across the sandy plains.  No life is evident here, no animal walks
the arid land, and no water nourishes the thirsty ground.  The temperature
is scorching hot, and walking without proper protection could result in
serious heatstroke.  Tiny white skeletons, half-buried by the sand, litter
the ground.  Where did these skeletons come from?

A Trail of Wooden Debris
  The ground here is littered with bits of wood, strangely enough.  Where
did this wood come from?  With jagged edges and uneven sizes, they look like
remnants of an unidentifiable object.  However, they can no longer tell
their tale - what tree they once were, what purpose were they cut down for. 
The wreckage that they have become is story enough, a vivid message that it
would be better to retreat now than to venture forth.

A Dusty Seabed
  Each footfall feels like stepping into mire, each breath feels ragged and
strained.  The horizon seems to disappear into the leagues of sand and
vanish.  North, east, west, south - all look the same, with endless sand in
every direction discouraging travelers from persisting in finding out the
mystery of this desert.  The thick layer of sand on everything has obscured
the truth of what has happened to this lonely place.

  Finally, the endless sea of sand seems to quiet down and settle on the
ground, but rebellious wisps still lick at low-lying objects, trying to suck
them down.  The scenery seems to change, if only because the surroundings
are no longer composed of the irritating sand particles that wreak havoc on
the passers-by.  Perhaps ahead there may be something different, something
worth having come here for.

The Fissure
  Here, the landscape dramatically changes.  A large fissure gapes open in
the middle of the ground, seemingly out of nowhere.  The strangeness of such
an occurrence begs the question: why is it here, in the middle of this
accursed place?  Is it, perhaps the key to this desolate place?  It almost
beckons one to crawl in, as if it promises an experience not to be missed.

  Ramparts stand half-erect in the distance, posing a paltry defense.  The
sands mock the once-noble structure, dancing across the stones and eroding
the semblance of dignity the walls once held.  The gates gape open, no
longer holding the fort against unwanted visitors; there may have once been
a moat, but it now exists only in the depths of the swarming sand.  The
entrance yawns open, no longer a bulwark against the whims of the outside

as how the sound of the sand is completely dulled in this room.  The only

  To the north, the sea begins to curve slowly downward, forming the lip of
the monstrous watery vortex that is the maelstrom.  The restless waters, and
all trapped within, are pulled slowly, inexorably inward and downward, first

sides.  To the east, a caravel seesaws at the brink, its doomed crew
fighting futilely against the inevitable.

Approaching a large clinic
  You are standing before a large building to the north. It appears to have 
been carefully constructed with large bricks and steel on the corners.
Perhaps the builders had in mind that this establishment must withstand some 
significant weather events. Occasionally, people rush by, heading towards the
building. The exits west, east and south head back to the continent of 
Mesolar.

On the banks of the Dragon River
  The vegetation along the banks of Mesolar's most famous river consists
mostly of cat tails, reeds and rushes.  Here and there, other unidentifiable
greenery makes its presence known.  The smell of mud and fish permeates the
air, and the gurgling of the river is a soothing, pleasant sound.  From
here, the waters of the Dragon River look clean and clear, but the ground
underfoot is damp; thick greenery covers the saturated earth.  To the north
the Mesolarian grassland offers a feast for those who know where to look,
and in the distance a herd of deer make their way over the open expanse.

  You stand in a large hall.  The ceiling stands about thirty feet overhead
and shimmers and sparkles.  The floor is made of onyx and is polished. 
The north and west walls are jade, but covered with tapestries.  The
tapestries depict many different figures, but prominent is a huge githzerai
wielding a flawless silver sword defending a huge beholder.

A Quiet Meadow
  Soft breezes sway the long grasses invitingly.  A slight scent of seawater
drifts from the north where you can just see a rocky outcropping.  Looking
around, you are slightly puzzled.  To the best of your recollection there
was once a quaint little village here.  A well-trodden path leads north
towards the sound of waves crashing against rocks.

  Gazing out, all you see is an endless expanse of water.  Far, far below
the waves crash against jagged slices of shoreline.  A thin stretch of beach
is barely visible at the base of the cliffs, and that might just be another
being standing at the water's edge.  The main path continues on right over
the cliff's edge, as if there used to be land there and a place for the path
to go.  Looking around for a possible way down, you spy a fresh trail
heading off to the east.

yourself over the edge, determined to ask of this other what has happened

  At last, you place your feet on solid ground.  Looking up, you can hardly
believe that you actually were able to make it down the cliff unscathed. 
The beach stretches out before you, inviting you to stroll along and
discover the local flora and fauna.  Everywhere you see rampant signs of
flourishing life.  Tide pools teem with small, scurrying creatures and
shells glisten in the sunlight.  All in all, it is a rather picturesque
place.  Further ahead you can make out with certainty the form of a little
green man gazing out over the waters.  Maybe now you can finally find out

  Finally, you have reached the water's edge.  Here stands the man you saw

back out to the turbulent sea, his face sinking into an expression of deep
sadness.  Looking past him, you see a drop off in the shoreline.  There is a
faint luminescence in the water, almost as if a path has been outlined on

into the depths must have happened so quickly that the air was trapped
inside it.  Amazingly enough, everything in this house is right where you

reside here, as there are quite a few homey touches.  Powerful protective
magic must be afoot here, for this strange happenstance to have taken place.

A Hidden Passage
  Dropping into a tight and narrow passage, you wonder if this was such a
good idea.  Luckily, the little glow worms from the cave above shed a dim
light. You can see that the passage continues on to the south, and curves
west as it goes.

A Dead End
  The darkness closes around you as you reach the end of the passageway. 
Reaching out blindly, your hand meets the closest wall.  There is barely
room to turn full circle and you can feel yourself becoming disoriented. 
Pulse pounding, you frantically scramble to feel your way out.  There, a
slight niche, just overhead.  This is not the way that you came in, but
possibly a way to escape this inky darkness.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  You have wandered out of the Academy and into Boot Camps clanhall. 
Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Syntax: skills ((<from level> <to level>) (<filter>) | all)
        spells ((<from level> <to level>) (<filter>) | all)

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list of
available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in order
of level.  The practiced percentage is listed, as well as the spell number
(see 'help cast') and casting cost for spells.

Without a level range, these commands will show all abilities from level 1
to your current level.  Specifying a range will show all skills/spells for
the given range.  Forgotten Skills or spells (see 'help forgetskill') are
not displayed unless the 'all' option is used.

You may also use any of the following filters for these commands:

    Affected   - abilities currently affecting you
    Area       - abilities that target an entire room
    Attack     - abilities that add an additional attack to combat
    Bad        - abilities that cause a bad affect on the target
    Combat     - combat-based abilities

Syntax: cast scry <target>
Spell Number: 236

Using this ancient art, a high-powered spellcaster can magically spy upon
others from afar.  The target will only sense a presence, but will never know
who exactly it was.  However, some characters have been able to wish for the
ability to see who is scrying them, and the caster will never be quite sure
who has been granted this wish.

Primary Stats: Int, Wis, Luck.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  Here, the dim light that has guided your path coalesces into one
brilliant pinpoint.  The entire area seems to almost throb with otherworldly
phosphorescence.  Looking closely, you can see that in the midst of all this
light, there is a small blemish of darkness at the base of a huge rock
that blocks the path.  Strange ciphers are etched into the rock's surface. 
Could they be the key to continuing on your adventure?  

[ Exits: east south ]
     Is that a tiny crack in the dark rocky surface?
Touche!  Better be prepared to parry with this fish.
Grab a net and avoid the stingers!
This flashy slitherer can light up your day.
A school of goldfish flashes by.

You step into the Blemish of Darkness and arrive in...
Under the Rock
  You tumble out from under the rock into what looks to be a completely
different part of the sea.  You are shrouded in an inky blackness, no longer
able to see the light of the sky above.  Ahead, however, glimpses of light
shimmer through the water toward you.  The beginnings of a coral reef, by
the looks of it: beauty in the depths of darkness.

The Beginning of a Coral Reef
  All around you a reef comprised of coral spreads along the sea's bottom. 
Here you can see that a path has been cleared.  It is strangely meandering,
however, as if the creator were incapable of forging a straight line. 
Looking around you, it seems fairly obvious that the creatures here with
you are more than likely the culprits.  

[ Exits: north south ]
The size of this snake not only intimidates you, but makes you want to run screaming.
Slithering out of the shadows, a sentry eyes you warily. Shifty bugger.

  Everywhere you look, the denizens of this land slither along.  The coral
looms over you, trapping you in the murky depths.  Perhaps this quest is
destined to be ill-fated.  Feeling as if failure is predestined, you
suddenly notice something that quickens your pulse.  There, against the
far wall!  It's an arrow, directing you to continue on to the north;
finally, a sign that you are heading along the correct path.

Stench and slime envelop this nauseating creature.

A Coral Cavern (G)
  Here, the walls rise high overhead.  The water rushes in from behind you,
trying to push you farther along.  Grabbing onto a jutting wall, you pause
to get your bearings.  To your left you can see a small cave, virtually
undetectable without close examination.  To the north, the coral closes in
again, with barely enough room for you to pass.

  After battling the current, you find yourself in a smallish cave.  The
walls glow with an eerie light, the source of which seems to be some kind of
small worm.  As they move, they leave behind a trail of illumination.  Your
eye tracks the path of one close to the floor, and as you watch it seems to
disappear from sight!

A Dead End
  The darkness closes around you as you reach the end of the passageway. 
Reaching out blindly, your hand meets the closest wall.  There is barely
room to turn full circle and you can feel yourself becoming disoriented. 
Pulse pounding, you frantically scramble to feel your way out.  There, a
slight niche, just overhead.  This is not the way that you came in, but
possibly a way to escape this inky darkness.

A Storage Room
  Dark and dismal, this room has long since stopped being a store house
for the inhabitants.  Empty shelves line the walls; dust and a glowing
fungus are the only inventory.  The only thing that makes this room
noteworthy in any way is the fact that it is an air pocket, albeit one
filled with stale air.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."  

[ Exits: north south west other ]

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

>>   *[NOEXP]* Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza
  In contrast to the somber reputation of the arch marking the western
entrance to the plaza, the Sunrise Arch is a place to celebrate new life. 
When the New Year's procession winds through the streets, it is tradition
for the celebrants to write their worries of the old year on scrolls and
toss them into a fire built under the arch.  The stone has been stained
black with the soot of a million fears, and each sunrise is a pyre to
consume them again.  At night, the arch is a favored meeting place of
conspirators.  All varieties of hooded figures skulk here by night, before
wandering off to conduct their business.

  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears

unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that

>>   *[NOEXP]* North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

A Quiet Meadow
  Soft breezes sway the long grasses invitingly.  A slight scent of seawater
drifts from the north where you can just see a rocky outcropping.  Looking
around, you are slightly puzzled.  To the best of your recollection there
was once a quaint little village here.  A well-trodden path leads north
towards the sound of waves crashing against rocks.  
 
A wooden sign sticks up from the grass.

Overlooking a Newly Formed Sea (G)
  Gazing out, all you see is an endless expanse of water.  Far, far below
the waves crash against jagged slices of shoreline.  A thin stretch of beach
is barely visible at the base of the cliffs, and that might just be another
being standing at the water's edge.  The main path continues on right over
the cliff's edge, as if there used to be land there and a place for the path
to go.  Looking around for a possible way down, you spy a fresh trail
heading off to the east.

  Here the winds are no longer gentle, and you struggle to maintain your

possible descent, but can those rocks possibly hold your weight?  The form
that you previously glimpsed is much clearer, and you can see that it is,
indeed, a person standing on the beach.  Taking a deep breath, you lower
yourself over the edge, determined to ask of this other what has happened
to the peaceful village that once stood here.

  A shallow ledge allows you to pause to take a deep breath.  Screeching
gulls swoop overhead, cursing your intrusion of their domain.  Your
trembling fingers are torn and bleeding from scrambling for purchase on the
jagged rock.  The winds whip you mercilessly, almost sending you reeling off
of the sheer face.  Looking up, you see that to attempt to return to safer
ground is near to impossible.  Down seems to be the only option.

  At last, you place your feet on solid ground.  Looking up, you can hardly
believe that you actually were able to make it down the cliff unscathed. 
The beach stretches out before you, inviting you to stroll along and
discover the local flora and fauna.  Everywhere you see rampant signs of
flourishing life.  Tide pools teem with small, scurrying creatures and
shells glisten in the sunlight.  All in all, it is a rather picturesque
place.  Further ahead you can make out with certainty the form of a little
green man gazing out over the waters.  Maybe now you can finally find out

  The warm sands cushion your steps as you wander closer to the shoreline. 
There seems to be an abundance of life everywhere...  The sands are patterned
with strange, wavering lines, as if something has crawled from the sea to
further up the beach.  All around you are misshapen lumps of sand, and to
the north a large lump seems to be attracting the attention of quite a few
of the gulls.

  Finally, you have reached the water's edge.  Here stands the man you saw

back out to the turbulent sea, his face sinking into an expression of deep
sadness.  Looking past him, you see a drop off in the shoreline.  There is a
faint luminescence in the water, almost as if a path has been outlined on
the sea's floor.  Perhaps a closer look is worthwhile.

  Dark and dismal, this room has long since stopped being a store house
for the inhabitants.  Empty shelves line the walls; dust and a glowing
fungus are the only inventory.  The only thing that makes this room
noteworthy in any way is the fact that it is an air pocket, albeit one
filled with stale air.

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

Aylor's great and noble quest master.  To the south even more crowds
gather to find the treasures of Grandmarket Boulevard.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

>>   Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

>>   North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  A towering waterfall soars above the surrounding forest and continues

water pounds your ears as chaotic mists spiral, twist and turn about 
you. The light from The Three Moons - Nuitari, Lunitari and Solinari - 
create a dazzling array of colors which invade your senses. Yellows,
violets, reds and blues fade into one another and together with the 
chaotic mists create a reality void of definition, form and substance. 
While searching within the mists of chaos, you are able to hear the 
faint sounds of music pierce through the roar of the falling water. 
Following the sounds to the far end of waterfall, an ancient stone 
structure emerges from the mists.

Navigation
  All in all, the layout of the newly formed sea is fairly
simple. I have made my camp on the south-eastern beach of
the sea. Most of the underwater realm is impassable, as the
plantlife grows far too thickly. In the deepest part,
however, you can traverse a path to a large glowing rock. At
its base is a small crack through which you can crawl, with
a bit of squirming. Past that is a coral reef, where the Sea
Snakes have made their home. It borders right on the far
cliffs of the sea. They have tunneled into the cliffs to
form their palace, and it is there you will find the King
and their Mage.

Inhabitants
  Here on the beach, and above on the cliff, life is
relatively normal, despite that there simply was no beach or
cliff here before at all.
  The first portion of the underwater realm is inhabited
by the sort of things you would expect to inhabit a sea.
Fish, eels, anemones, crabs; all can be found here. I suspect
the Sea Snakes leave them be to promote a sense of normalcy
on the unsuspecting diver.
  Past the rock, the Sea Snakes have taken over wholesale.
They vary in size, ferocity, and cunning, but they are,
without exception, all evil and all dangerous. Some, however,
given the proper attention or gifts, may be given to provide
information.

Awareness
  There is nothing more important to know than to be aware
of your surroundings. Always keep an eye out for things that
stand out as abnormal. Sometimes, even things that may seem
normal, but are noteworthy in their location, are worth an extra
look at.

Papawolf answers 'duration is a big convience I think but if you have decent spellup management it
isn't "necessary"'

NsEw questions 'on another topic then, do all spellcasters go with dual wielding weapons or use a
shield ?'

Character autosaved at Sun Jul 30 18:19:11 2023.

TrEz answers 'im dual unless something's slapping me too hard'

NsEw answers 'good info thanks all for the input.'

Cide answers 'after i get warrior though im with trez'

Papawolf answers 'I use a shield always because I tend to fight monsters much higher level than me
when grinding exp and the little bit of extra damage from dual wield isn't as important as the 15% 
damage reduction'

Papawolf answers 'but I probably should be dual wielding when I am campaigning just don't like to
switch back and forth'

Papawolf answers 'also I think it depends a lot on tier too, zero tier the extra attacks don't help
as much as higher tier due to gear bonus levels'

Myth questions 'dual weapon gives 3 extra attacks. must be more than 15%, besides you can easily
outquaff extra damage from mobs'

Papawolf answers 'but I say do some dtracking and decide for yourself'

Papawolf answers 'well for me melee damage is about 20% of my overall damage (with the other 80%
from spells)'

Papawolf answers 'and dual damage is about 10% of the melee damage'

Papawolf answers 'so it is literally 2% extra damage vs 15% damage reduction'

Papawolf answers 'but your milage may vary'

Myth questions 'well then maybe, though then i would question is melee damage at 20% is reasonable'

Noodlez questions 'off 10'

Papawolf answers 'well I did dtracks for an entire mort and that was the value I got'

INFO: DjVoltron has been reborn as an Eldar Cleric.

INFO: DjVoltron has entered open PK (OPK) mode!

Myth questions 'i'm not saying your numbers are wrong, i'm saying maybe you should put more
attention to your melee damage?'

Papawolf answers 'yeah better weapons would change that number a lot'

Watashi answers 'And being T9, and pthief too i imagine :p'

Papawolf answers 'but seriously I suggest anyone wanting to decide should dual wield for awhile with
dtrack skill on their primary damage spell and see what their numbers are'

INFO: All hail Shelia! Champion of Kimr's Farm!

NsEw questions 'So as a ninja, Myth, do you dual wield or hand to hand ? and if hand to hand, how
much better for a ninja is that compared to dual wield ?'

## You are very hungry; your healing is reduced.
## You are very thirsty; your healing is reduced.

to t0. the way i kill mobs is very different (i kill most of them from backstab)'
