WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Entrance to Annwn
  The entrance to the islands of Annwn is inviting enough. The road is well 
maintained and easily accessible. This is the land that is described in
the recently found manuscripts in the catacombs of Aylor. The great
minstrel Talisin wrote about these islands in his epic poems. However,
many of the scrolls upon which his poems are written have been severely
damaged. Scholars claim the entrance here leads to the afterlife.
Adventurers have come here to explore in the past, but never has a soul
returned to tell the story of their journey. The road continues to the
east, albeit less maintained. Nevertheless, you can sense no imminent
danger in that direction. It might be worth checking it out.

Lost Souls Inn (G)
  This must be the strangest inn you have ever visited. There are numerous
ethereal beings sitting on chairs at the tables, but they are managing to
leave the layer of dust that is covering everything completely
undisturbed. They are all drinking, and you wonder where the liquid they
consume is ending up. Some of the guests look at you quizzically. At
least, you feel them looking at you, but they have no eyes, just empty
sockets. The ceiling looks about to cave in, and the walls are tainted
with strange brown spots. A place this uninviting and yet so busy must
truly be the last place to have a drink. The only mortal here is behind
the bar. That might be a good person to start interrogating, since there's
nothing else to find here.

  This must be the strangest inn you have ever visited. There are numerous
ethereal beings sitting on chairs at the tables, but they are managing to
leave the layer of dust that is covering everything completely
undisturbed. They are all drinking, and you wonder where the liquid they
consume is ending up. Some of the guests look at you quizzically. At
least, you feel them looking at you, but they have no eyes, just empty
sockets. The ceiling looks about to cave in, and the walls are tainted
with strange brown spots. A place this uninviting and yet so busy must
truly be the last place to have a drink. The only mortal here is behind
the bar. That might be a good person to start interrogating, since there's
nothing else to find here.

Docks of Annwn (G)
  These docks look desolate. When you squint your eyes you think you see a few 
ships docked to the south, but you can't be sure. The pavement is poorly 
maintained and, to your horror, you can see all kinds of despicable insects 
scurrying at your feet. The smell of decay fills your nostrils, and a low, 
lingering, putrid brown fog slowly creeps over the docks. Towards the east 
you can make out some sort of building with a sign on it that reads 'Lost 
Souls Inn'. Going back up is probably your best option, but if you must, you 
could try to find out more at the inn.

The harbormaster peers at you intently.

The harbormaster says, "Ah, another soul looking for a resting place."

The harbormaster says, "Just enter the ship of your choice in the docking
 area."

Ship Docking Area
  The docking area is not what you expected. It is merely a ruined wooden
pier with a lot of missing planks. The remaining planks seem already
rotten to the core. You want to negotiate these docks carefully, since the
water below them is anything but clear. In fact, it seems rather rancid.
The four ships moored here are not very well maintained. Maybe stepping
into one would sink it instantly. To the west you spot an escape back to
the gates. The alternative is entering one of these ships. Will you choose
safety over adventure?

something man made, not a freak of nature. What will lie beyond these caves?

Entrance to Annwn
  The entrance to the islands of Annwn is inviting enough. The road is well 
maintained and easily accessible. This is the land that is described in
the recently found manuscripts in the catacombs of Aylor. The great
minstrel Talisin wrote about these islands in his epic poems. However,
many of the scrolls upon which his poems are written have been severely
damaged. Scholars claim the entrance here leads to the afterlife.
Adventurers have come here to explore in the past, but never has a soul
returned to tell the story of their journey. The road continues to the
east, albeit less maintained. Nevertheless, you can sense no imminent
danger in that direction. It might be worth checking it out.

sockets. The ceiling looks about to cave in, and the walls are tainted
with strange brown spots. A place this uninviting and yet so busy must

The harbormaster peers at you intently.

The harbormaster says, "Ah, another soul looking for a resting place."

The harbormaster says, "Just enter the ship of your choice in the docking
 area."

Ship Docking Area
  The docking area is not what you expected. It is merely a ruined wooden
pier with a lot of missing planks. The remaining planks seem already
rotten to the core. You want to negotiate these docks carefully, since the
water below them is anything but clear. In fact, it seems rather rancid.
The four ships moored here are not very well maintained. Maybe stepping
into one would sink it instantly. To the west you spot an escape back to
the gates. The alternative is entering one of these ships. Will you choose
safety over adventure?

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

  This field is slowly crumbling into the rushing river to the east. As you 
watch, more and more of the unprotected shoreline ripples away into the 
thunderous water. To the northwest, a small forest broods over the fields all
around it. Somewhere eastwards, a small trail collapses into what has become 
known as Kettermoor Crick: the fishy river leading into what is known as 
Mesolar's melting pot of debauchery. One may merely cross the Kettermoor to 
enter Fellchantry.

On the Crickbridge Road
  It was a dark and stormy night...

  There's a saying out in the darker parts of the country that, for a man
in the right kinds of trouble, all roads lead to Fellchantry. They say that
when "No Fear" Narlfryd, the famed Wolfen daredevil, needed a place to lay
low, he came to Fellchantry and knifed a guy over a card game. The story
goes that he wanted to use a vacation in a cell as a chance to let a bad
storm blow over. The authorities didn't give him the chance. They took one
look at that body, shook their heads, and walked the other way. Fellchantry
is just that kind of place. Around here, they're ALL dark and stormy nights,
and the residents like it that way just fine.

  To the east lies the bridge over Kettermoor Crick, the deceptively named
fast-running river that supplies Fellchantry with its ne'erending supply of
fish, trade taxes, and surly attitudes.

Brimtoil Alley
  The entrance to the small network of Fellchantry's alleyways seems to be more
populated than further in. Establishments, all of clean and honorable repute 
of course, have taken down walls and built doors, setting up tables or stalls
along the eastern and western side, trading in weapons, oddly valuable 
jewelry, gems, glass passed off as gems, illusions passed off as glass, and 
lies passed off as illusions. Upon close inspection, one may even spy one of 
the Justiciary among the patrons of this fine market road.

Further south, the alleyway eventually twists east and out of sight.

Fellchantry Square
  A very curious amount of folks who traffic to the south have their hoods 
drawn, save the braver and more scary-looking individuals who stalk with the 
deadly (and frankly, sometimes swaying) grace of the land's most hardened 
criminals, traffickers and scorned illegitimate children ever to be produced
on Andolorian soil. It's not difficult to suss out the fact that in yonder 
direction lies a network of alleyways, nor is it difficult to determine that 
some folks are simply not welcome among the raff. Nay, quite often an unlucky
individual would find themselves pleading, hoisted by their britches and 
tossed from the narrow building flanks into the pounded cobble below, ejected
from the seedy underbelly of Fellchantry.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  The trees thin a little and the dirt path angles roughly northward. The path 
has been quite worn down with use. Though you can see the usual bootprints of
human soldiers that like to traverse this area, there is also a marking that 
is not one of theirs. Though it is not paved, this road is well tended in its
usage, except for a section on the east side.

  The sudden change in natural lighting compared to the northern patch of wood

they have a chance to reach the ground. Below, the tangle of roots nearly

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Entering a Dense Jungle
  Stepping into a dark jungle, you find yourself in the midst of a vast
mixture of vines, trees, and underbrush.  There are signs that people have
passed through here recently, several of them.  To the north, further into
the jungle, you can see a shadow moving here and there behind trees.  The
rustling of the branches above helps to conceal the sound of animal
movement.

Further into a Jungle (1279)

Further into a Jungle
  Further yet into the jungle, you climb your way through the deepening
underbrush, fighting away the insects that have acquired a taste for your
flesh.  In looking around, you notice that the brush covering the north path
is getting more and more dense, probably too dense to go on much farther. 
You can enter the opening here and force yourself the rest of the way. 
South is back the way you came.

roar
You roar at the sentry and instantly know you've made a mistake! The
cougress lunges at your hind quarter and you feel teeth sink into your tender
flesh. A calm comes over you as you realize she's not planning on eating you.
The calm quickly subsides as you feel yourself get whisked away! You try to
clear your mind and focus on where she's taking you, but confusion soon settles
in. The tall grass whips at your now bare back, stinging your skin with
each lope of the large cat. Suddenly the path becomes rockier, and pebbles
start bouncing around you after being kicked up by the sentry. With a loud
THUD a pacifying warmth overcomes you as the final clear thoughts run through
your mind, and you realize that it's your own blood that is running across your
face. Darkness ensues and an indeterminate amount of time elapses once you
pass out from the blood loss...
A Medic Tent (G)
  You awake to find yourself laying on a cot, with several attendants
surrounding you.  The pain in your leg still throbs.  A familiar face, human
at least, looks over you, checking the progress of your wounds.  The words
that fill the air, however, are definitely foreign, except for one voice-
the voice of Suzian is comforting, and in your language!  You try to
concentrate on that voice, making out bits and pieces here and there.  You
should probably pay her a lot of attention.

battle are these people fighting?  Who is their enemy?  What is your

  Here, further down the road, the citizens seem more sparse.  To one side,
you see a rusty gate with many locks and chains securing it shut.  On the
other side is a large, new building stands littered with war slogans urging
the Cougarian people to join the Cougarian Army Tactical Squad.  North of
here, the city seems to kind of drop off, with little more than a hole in
the ground.  You guess this is the den of a native, and pay it little
notice.  You wonder what the Cougarian Army might be like, and consider the
recruitment office.  Just then, a faded sign hung with wire on the rusty

  The feeling of the city is suddenly changed into ruins as you step through
this crack in time.  You see the occasional straggler walking by and
step on pieces of broken vials from long forgotten magical potions.  You
remember your walk through town and it didn't hit you until just now- there
were no magicians, clerics, any magic users whatsoever, in the main part of
town.  You realize why when your gaze fixes on notices posted on the doors
in this run down part of town.

An Unused Road
  The road here is dark and dreary, with fugitive magic users roaming in the
shadows.  These are the outcasts of Cougaria, those whose livelihood has
been taken from them for the good of the people.  To banish magic, meant to
banish these citizens, who now teach their ways through word of mouth only. 
To write of their practices would be to forsake what little the Cougarian
queen still provides them... the peace to finish their lives in solitude.

you into their magical ways.

Through a Rusty Gate (1276)

Continuing on Cougarian Way
  Here, further down the road, the citizens seem more sparse.  To one side,
you see a rusty gate with many locks and chains securing it shut.  On the
other side is a large, new building stands littered with war slogans urging
the Cougarian people to join the Cougarian Army Tactical Squad.  North of
here, the city seems to kind of drop off, with little more than a hole in
the ground.  You guess this is the den of a native, and pay it little
notice.  You wonder what the Cougarian Army might be like, and consider the
recruitment office.  Just then, a faded sign hung with wire on the rusty
gate catches your attention.

  You enter the battlefield and immediately hear the clang of swords and
crash of spells all around you.  Few safe havens still exist on the parched
earth, and you dodge behind a makeshift barrier of fallen feline warriors. 
Protected for the moment, you realize you wont be safe long.  The need to
find a secure location is pressing if you intend to survive.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

are teaching you that you did not know pain before. Perpetual winds choke you
with sand and the air is always opaque with dust, but somehow the sun's heat

A Long and Treacherous Road
  Stretching out to an almost imperceptible point to the west, this hazardous 
road is barely passable. Mostly hot and dry, with brief respites along the 
way, all but the most determined adventurer would be discouraged and hie back
to more hospitable climes. Travelers would be well advised to stick together 
for mutual support on a journey such as this.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Walking Through the Horde Encampment
  The hard-trodden path wends its way through the tents and buildings in the 
camp. Even though it is wide enough to allow several wagons to pass 
side-by-side it feels crowded and cramped for all the troops moving about.
It could be dangerous to try and stay here long if you weren't uniformed.

Inside a Tent, Seductively Comfortable
  Stepping inside, the tent you've entered is lavishly furnished with gold-gilt
and purple satin. A considerable fortune has been spent on all that surrounds
you, and the inconvenience to move this many fine things is no small matter 
either. The tent's owner obviously carries some leverage and has servants 
enough to transport all their highly unnecessary belongings on a war 
campaign. A sole candle lights the room and flickers playfully over the 
contents.

  You have finally reached the end of the camp, but instead of relief for the 
end of an unbearably long walk, all you can feel is awe. Awe, because to the

The Torturer's Tent
  One step through the tent's entrance and the only thing on your mind is 
leaving. A torture victim's screams stab into your ears and the stench of 
death hangs oppressive in the air. The tent must be under some enchantment 
for the incessant screaming to be inaudible even directly outside the tent.
Shelves and tables lined with innumerable devices of tortuous nature distract
from the water tank, iron maiden, and white hot fire.

Keeping Along the Road
  The path carries forward still, moving pretty much straight north. Here you 
come to an intersection with the main path veering sharply west and an 
offshoot continuing further north to a cluster of tents. The first you've 
seen that stand alone, it could be interesting to investigate. And then again
the rest of the camp still lies undiscovered.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Lanten's Tavern
  This tavern provides one of the few places of refuge from the despair and 
depression running rampant throughout the city. A large stage has a band 
playing on it while dancing girls show a bit of leg with each high kick. A 
bar lines the whole southern wall, and it appears nearly any drink you could 
think of can be served here. A silver saber hangs on the wall behind the 
bartender, and it doesn't look like it is just for decoration.

the wall, but don't produce much light. Cells line the walls, and are locked 
for your protection. The only way out of here is to climb back up the stairs,
unless someone has made a tunnel in one of the cells!

A Magical Cell
  This cell has magical writings on all the walls, creating a mystical barrier 
around it. So once you're locked in here, you'd need to be able to unlock the
magics as well. This cage must be reserved for the most nefarious criminals.
The bars of the cage are thick and strong, and along with the barrier makes 
an inescapable cell.

The Ruins of Main Street
  Main Street is a very wide street, but is covered in rubble. A haze covers 
the area, preventing you from seeing very far away. The cobblestones of the 
road are poorly maintained. Many are missing, creating large holes in the 
ground which could trip the unwary traveller. The street continues to the 
east and south.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.
