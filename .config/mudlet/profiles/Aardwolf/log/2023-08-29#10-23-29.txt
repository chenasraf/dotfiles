Task 3  : Talk to the Statues

Thalien says, "I was trying to pick these flowers for Sarah when these people
came through a door in the well and kidnapped me." 

Thalien says, "Life was dismal after that because they barely fed me and 
even the water was scarce." 

Thalien says, "I did learn that they are part of some kind of cult that 
worships someone called Zyian." 

Thalien says, "Something strange did happen while I was here that I think 
I should tell you about." 

Thalien says, "As I was walking past these statues, I heard a voice whisper 
that I shouldn't lose hope."

 Thalien says, "Maybe you should find them and see what you can find 
out about these cultists."

  The halls of this castle are dimly lit by an unknown source.  Along the
walls, strange glyphs are scrawled.  They appear to be freshly made, and
written in blood.  As you walk along, you can hear a mixture of laughing,
screaming and moaning, but you cannot tell from where.

  The shelves of the library hold many different types of books and are

the books seem to contain knowledge of battle.  To the south, a book of
spells.  Each side of the library also has a large wooden door, and you
can't help but feel that what is behind the door will rely on the knowledge
learnt from the books that surround it.

Before the Temple
{coords}3,12,28

  As you pass the trial, the southern door opens to you and leads you out
in front of this large temple.  It is carved almost entirely out of white
marble, and contains many beautifully crafted stained glass windows.  Many
are showing acts of love, friendship and mercy.  The doors to the cathedral
are very large, and made mostly out of wood.  They have long bands of iron,
which are nailed to the planks, keeping the door in one piece.

Sarah exclaims, "Shortly after he went into the well, I heard him yell, and 
when I looked down I saw some robed people carrying him through a doorway 
behind a large boulder!" 

Sarah exclaims, "I tried to follow them, but the doorway closed before I could 
go any farther, and the noises I heard beyond the door frightened me!" 

Sarah says, "I need you to go in there, rescue Thalien, and see what those 
robed people are doing." 

Sarah says, "He might be too scared to believe you, so if you give him the 
flowers in the well, then he will know that you are on his side."
