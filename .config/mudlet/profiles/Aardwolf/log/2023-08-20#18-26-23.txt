Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     (Magic) A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

  You find yourself standing before a dark and ominous cave. Villagers from the
town told you to look for a middle-aged man named Darkon Stills near the 
entrance to the cave. This must be him, and this must be the cave.

 like the type to seek adventure and there is a fairly good reward if you
 are willing to help us."

The dark cave
  Entering the dark cave, an overwhelming feeling of dread and despair fills 
your being. Smells of rotten decay waft up from below with sounds that pierce
your being and make the hairs on your neck stand on end. You wonder if this 
adventure is really worth the rewards after hearing tales in the village 
about an eight-armed skeleton who stole a woman only two days ago. Maybe it 
was just the peasant's imagination working during the excitement of the 
moment. Looking around to make sure it's safe to go down, you notice 
something scrawled on the wall.

  Dropping down through the hole above you, you find yourself standing in a 
twisting passageway of stone. Red eyes glowing in the darkness gleam at you 
and the shuffling sounds of something moving nearer reaches your ears.
Quickly lighting a torch you hold it up, gasping with fear as you take a step
back as undead move forward. So many of them, so many different kinds, your 
mind races... How can this be that they are all working together like this?
Your question will have to wait...

A rough hewn passageway of stone
  Finally emerging past the rows of caverns, you find yourself still traveling 
through the rough stone passageways. Curving to the east you see a light up 
ahead in what appears to be a much larger cavern. If there is light perhaps 
there is help, or at least maybe no undead to contend with. Maybe the priests
are not the only ones here trying to help.

A rough hewn passageway of stone
  Finally emerging past the rows of caverns, you find yourself still traveling 
through the rough stone passageways. Curving to the east you see a light up 
ahead in what appears to be a much larger cavern. If there is light perhaps 
there is help, or at least maybe no undead to contend with. Maybe the priests
are not the only ones here trying to help.

A large, lit cavern (G)
  A ladder descends through a hole in the floor here; unfortunately it is 
covered by some type of glass dome with a strange lock on it. You nearly jump
out of your boots as a deep hiss comes from a dark corner of the room. You 
leap back and ready your weapons as a sword narrowly whistles past your gut.
Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of 
your life. Your thoughts fade as it comes at you, blades whistling through 
the air...

A large, lit cavern (G)
  A ladder descends through a hole in the floor here; unfortunately it is 
covered by some type of glass dome with a strange lock on it. You nearly jump
out of your boots as a deep hiss comes from a dark corner of the room. You 
leap back and ready your weapons as a sword narrowly whistles past your gut.
Trembling, you face your opponent, the eight armed skeleton that the 
villagers told you about. Its eyes glow bright red, a deep hatred of your 
life plainly visible in them. It unslings three shields and draws four more 
swords. Set to advance, you quickly realize this may very well be the end of 
your life. Your thoughts fade as it comes at you, blades whistling through 
the air...

there is something behind that door that can help you figure out what's going

scratching noise coming from above you. Looking up you jump back in surprise 
as you narrowly escape the clawing blow of some strange creature climbing

  Moving forward you find yourself standing in a hallway of sorts. Close by to 
the north you can make out doorways leading to either side of the hallway 
while farther on you think you can barely see the outline of a door. Maybe 
there is something behind that door that can help you figure out what's going
on around here. As you ponder the thoughts you're having you hear a faint 
scratching noise coming from above you. Looking up you jump back in surprise 
as you narrowly escape the clawing blow of some strange creature climbing 
along the walls!

  Standing outside what appears to be doorways on either side of you, you 
struggle to see into either room, but the twisting rock curves around, 
keeping you from seeing what awaits in them. Strangely enough you think you 
see a dim glow of light coming from the west room, while the east room 
remains completely black. Looking down you notice a thin trail of blood 
running along the floor and leading into the west room...

A rough hewn passageway of stone
  Standing outside what appears to be doorways on either side of you, you 
struggle to see into either room, but the twisting rock curves around, 
keeping you from seeing what awaits in them. Strangely enough you think you 
see a dim glow of light coming from the west room, while the east room 
remains completely black. Looking down you notice a thin trail of blood 
running along the floor and leading into the west room...

[ Exits: north east south west up down ]
(Red Aura) A skeleton rattles as it runs screaming for you!
(Red Aura) An insane-looking, green-skinned, bald man sits here gnawing on a bone.
Skeleton hisses at you!

  A small man and woman sit here at a table; a single candle flickers and burns
on a small stand to one side. Grinning, the man rises and greets you.
"Hello, I'm Randall Fen-rir Get and this is my wife Tikki." Lowering his 
voice to a low snarl, he gestures to the table. "Care to join us for a 
feast?" Raising your torch lets you see that a human hand rests on the plate 
before him, while his wife Tikki calmly rips another bite from the forearm 
she holds...

  This cavern seems to be some sort of refuse dump for body parts and personal 
belongings. Apparently there must be someone else around here to use this 
cavern as a waste room; certainly the undead would not care about such 
things. As you wonder about this discovery you sense some movement coming 
from the heaps of rotting flesh and clothing. Bracing yourself, you watch 
cautiously for the source. Suddenly you are showered by clumps of rot as a 
huge bulbous creature emerges, waving two tentacled arms about. It gnashes 
its teeth in a grotesque central maw as its single eye darts back and forth 
seemingly to keep you in its field of vision.

what appears to be more cavern entrances. A high pitched shriek rings out and
the sounds of steel clashing reach your ears. More shouts and curses follow 
the sounds of battle and an elven warrior dressed in gleaming chainmail 
staggers from the west room. He falls to one knee and supports himself on the
hilt of his sword. Blood runs freely from a nasty wound in his side. Looking 
up he motions you closer, "Please I beg of you, HELP THEM!"

A cavern
  Running into the room, you see a band of elven warriors standing together in 
a tight formation. Shields and swords drawn, they are facing a huge beast.
It appears to be some form of bear, but it has to be undead. Its ribcage 
shows exposed bone gleaming whitely in the torch light, and numerous other 
pieces of it seem to have just fallen off. The elves are obviously 
well-trained, and they move forward in unison attacking the beast 
ferociously, hacking lumps of flesh from its body. It roars in frustration 
and, seemingly unaffected, it charges!

A Fisherman's Hut
  Before you is a fisherman's tiny hovel.  It's quite obvious from the
state of repair (or disrepair, as the case may be), that the fisherman is
not a very good one....

The kobolds charge the castle...again.

You notice the grey moon falling to the west.

QUEST: You may now quest again.

A tepid, gentle breeze blows from the northeast.
The clouds disperse, leaving a clear night sky.

You can no longer sense anger.

Global Quest: Global Quest # 3562 has been won by Bezaleel - 549th win.

>>> Myrddin has reincarnated to Vampire Shaman. <<<

The scent of napalm fades from your nostrils.

Your force shield shimmers then fades away.
Your skin feels soft again.

You can no longer avoid some attacks.

The eldar hermit glides in from the north.

The yellow tent
  This is, by far, the most modest and smallest tent in the camp. The tent 
itself seems to have been thrown up in an unreasonable amount of haste.
Papers line the south, north, and western walls of the tent, some of which
have official stamps, signatures, or nothing at all Without any semblance of 
order, or of chaos, the sheer number of documents seems overwhelming for a 
single person, let alone a single kobold. The chaos to the west of kobolds 
training in combat is almost welcoming compared to the discord found within 
this yellow tent.

(Red Aura) The kobolds' recruiter, Sergeant Bifzot, is trying to sign you up.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

place of the only thing that can stop it. Beyond the Nenukon is said to be 
the Empire of The Far Country, a land of warriors, where the governing tribes
themselves are in a constant state of war.

Monuhi's Crypt! [**> PK <**]
  Welcome to your grave. Monuhi is older than time itself, any mortal who 
wishes to defeat him should have more power than they know what to do with, 
and even then some more. Many have come to challenge the master of evil, to 
this day, only one has succeeded. He was unable to kill Monuhi though, and 
instead trapped his soul inside scrolls of the Black Master. Too late though,
did this generation's warriors discover that it was he who was in the black 
scrolls, for now he has been released.

  As you enter the city gates, you notice some of the beauty and luxury
Pompeii offers.  Under your feet, the street is paved with smooth limestone,
and elaborately constructed buildings are all around.  To the west, you see
a sign on a door.  To the north, the city waits to be explored.  Bronze
oil lanterns in each doorway light the street and allow the spectacular
murals on the walls to be seen.

of the kingdom, has been in existence for perhaps 30 generations. The king 
looks with disdain upon the upstart tzars of the neighboring lands. They 
stole most of the lands of the Thrice Tenth Kingdom several hundred years

The Castle Courtyard
  The castle courtyard is bustling with activity. Peasants and farmers alike 
carry baskets, barrels and crates of goods into the castle. Perhaps they are 
preparing for a festival, or perhaps this is just an average day. More to 
wonder about and investigate.

  The castle is huge, the largest you have seen in the region. It is 
constructed of stone and mortar in a style that a historian would say is 
architecturally consistent with that of several hundred years ago.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

  Many different people rush about their work here.  This area is just
inside the main courtyard of the fortress.  Templars are going and coming
back from patrols.  A few servants are doing chores and a page glares at you
as he has to step around you on his way to deliver some messages.

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable

ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

The Captain yells to the crew and the ship starts to fly.
After a few days of travel, you look below and see a field with cows and other livestock.
The Captain orders the crew to lower the ladder.

The Captain of the Airship says, "Okay, we'll be here until you want to go
 somewhere else."
The Captain of the Airship says, "To get back here, all you need to do is
 climb the ladder."
Wide Field
  The fields of Conadrain are enormous, stretching as far as the eye can
see.  A large breeze stirs the foot tall grass in beautiful waves.  The area
is cloaked in the shadow of the airship, and you notice some rope trailing
beneath the beast.  The palace of the Conadrains lies a few miles ahead as
these are the fields of the Prince himself!

  The fields are dotted with various farmhouses.  These farmhouses are run
by state-hired workers.  These people are trained in the general running of
farmland, as well as breeding.  One of the things that has made the
Conadrain economy shoot up is the excellent products which their highly
advanced breeding program has produced.  Many of the farmers live out here,
though the majority still live in some nearby town.  The rare opportunity of
getting your own farmhouse is only given to the smartest and best farmers in
the employment of the Empire.

Bottom Cargo Hold of the Airship
  The rope ladder you climbed emptied you into this vast hold.  There are
crates of varied shapes and sizes scattered about the hold.  They appear to
be stacked in some semblance of order, most with a small and barely readable
script on them.  Hidden amongst a few larger crates in the corner is a
ladder leading up to the main stairwell of the airship.

Pasture
  The fertile land around here has undergone special care to grow plant life
suited to grazing.  Besides being known for their excellent crops, the
Conadrains produce some of the best meat in the Empire.  The quality of
their products has allowed them to create a virtual monopoly in the
agricultural business.  This has lead to the annexation of a few smaller
surrounding countries who could not afford to run themselves, since no one
would buy their food.

Grassy Field
  The fields of Conadrain surround you.  Conadrain derives much of its
wealth from the nutrient rich soil within its lands.  They are careful
however to preserve these nutrients and have developed a system to maximize
the use while not destroying the environment.  Many bandits have tried to
steal from these fields, however they always seem to get caught.  It is
rumored that there is a beautiful apple orchard around here somewhere.

  The large grassy fields part somewhat here.  The part of the field where
the grass parts appears to be some sort of path.  It is unlikely anything
could grow on this ground for it has the looks of ground which has been
tread upon for hundreds of years.  Perhaps this path will take you to the
imperial palace.  Unfortunately you are not sure, and you would not want to
stray onto a path which did not lead to the palace.  Perhaps you should ask
one of the locals about it?

Entrance to Palace
  The palace of the Conadrains lies before you.  It is renown for its beauty  
across the entire empire, even past the empire into lands unknown.  The
palace was constructed in the third year of the second emperor reign.  Back
then the empire was small and only included the land just around Conadrain. 
So the palace was not even a tenth of what is now.  It was constructed of pure
gold and was entirely renovated a few years ago.  The greatness of this palace
has proved itself through century after century of rebellions and war.  It was
prophezied along time ago, so long as this palace stands, the empire will
remain intact.  And it has withstanded from invasions for many, many centuries.

  The moment you walk into the palace you gawk at the sheer mass of wealth
on display here.  Red silk carpets line the floors and huge chandeliers
hang from the high ceiling.  The amazing thing is that the palace does not
appear to be gaudy or ostentatious.  Most of the riches had been accumulated
slowly over the years from the surplus of the Empire, or the Emperor's
private funds.  Huge hallways extend to your right and left.  Glancing
up you see that the palace extends to a second story.  Maybe there are some
stairs to the north?

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

in the brush.  Pleasant sounds of birds and trickling water carry

A Somber Walkway (G)
  After ascending a stairway of clouds leading into the heavens, an individual 
would probably expect to find something surreal at the top. Many an explorer 
has been left disappointed, however, since this is nothing more than the 
Ascension Bluff Nursing Home. The architect thought that a stairway of clouds
would make the residents feel closer to the gods. Unfortunately, all this 
served to do was make this location less suitable for visitors and employees 
to frequent. Further to this, when one closely inspects the clouds, they will
come to the realization that they are not real clouds at all, but rather 
millions of tiny cotton balls affixed to a steel frame. Interestingly enough,
it seems that a nursing home in the clouds acquires quite the eclectic bunch 
of residents. Anyone who chances by a for a visit will find that this nursing
home contains more than just your ordinary sampling of senior citizens.

in the brush.  Pleasant sounds of birds and trickling water carry

  Pews and a podium have been placed in this area, resulting in an
outdoor cathedral look.  The flowerbeds have been pruned to allow
for the seating of approximately 50 individuals.  Rather than the
pebble that covered the trails through the flowers, here the ground
is actually colored with various cemented rocks. A vague design seems

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A Somber Walkway (G)
  After ascending a stairway of clouds leading into the heavens, an individual 
would probably expect to find something surreal at the top. Many an explorer 
has been left disappointed, however, since this is nothing more than the 
Ascension Bluff Nursing Home. The architect thought that a stairway of clouds
would make the residents feel closer to the gods. Unfortunately, all this 
served to do was make this location less suitable for visitors and employees 
to frequent. Further to this, when one closely inspects the clouds, they will
come to the realization that they are not real clouds at all, but rather 
millions of tiny cotton balls affixed to a steel frame. Interestingly enough,
it seems that a nursing home in the clouds acquires quite the eclectic bunch 
of residents. Anyone who chances by a for a visit will find that this nursing
home contains more than just your ordinary sampling of senior citizens.

Entrance to Ascension Bluff
  At the entrance to the Ascension Bluff Nursing home the pathway widens into a
semi-circle of flagstones that are surrounded by several stout wooden 
benches. A low-set stone wall hugs all of these particulars, and three wide, 
curved steps lead up to the front entrance of the nursing home. This nursing 
home has been made to look like a lodge in hopes that the residents will feel
like they are simply here on vacation. The roof has a steep slope and the 
exterior of the building has been carefully crafted from wooden logs. Patio 
doors lead straight out to the front gardens and walkway from many locations 
along the front of the building. Even more light is brought into the nursing 
home via expansive, arched windows that take up much of the wall-space above
the patio doors.

>>    *[NOEXP]* The Laundry Room
  This is a very simple laundry room. The soiled linens and clothes go into one
basket, and there are several other baskets for the neatly folded, clean 
items. A large sink is available in the far corner of the room, just in case 
anything needs to be quickly hand-washed there. Generally, soiled items wait 
for the laundry sorcerer to come and clean them with his spells, unless they 
smell especially pungent. There is only one laundry sorcerer for all of the 
different buildings that hire one in the area, so he usually only swings by 
once a week. This is why anyone would want to do a quick, cursory clean of a 
ridiculously stinky item.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  There is a large iron gate here, with a short elf guarding it.  The gate
is going north into a mountain. There appears to be a cave north of here,
but you can't see through the gate very well.  There are many different
rocks embedded in the mountain.  It almost seems that they form a pattern.
You can hear the dripping of water from inside the caves.
There is also a cold draft of air hitting you.  Perhaps this is the
entrance to the legendary Dark Elf Fortress?

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Pass
  At the southwestern edge of the Halo Mountains lies the entrance to Dusk 
Valley.  The pass is fifteen feet wide and half a mile long.  Cliffs on both 
sides shoot up hundreds of feet.  The wind at the entrance of the pass screams 
through.  Small boulders and rocks continuously fall from above and explode 
upon impacting the ground.  The ground is made up of rock, dust, sand, and 
crushed up bones.  Near the end the pass where the cliffs end the ground 
transitions to a rich farmable soil.

Into the Dusk
  The cliffs of the Halo Mountains suddenly end at the edge of Dusk Valley.  
Stories tell of ancient arcane battles within these lands.  The rich, farmable 
soil along the road is damp and contains many varieties of bones from many 
different animals and races.  There is a fine steamy mist throughout the valley 
that dims out the sun during the day.  Shadows move about the mist and there 
are low moans in the distance.  The main road that runs north and south 
through the valley is perfectly constructed with glowing slate in an archaic 
printbone pattern.  Along the outside of the road many radiant globes float 
motionless above.

  The archaic printbone pattern in the glowing slate road ends abruptly.  A

square.  The bricks are made of some type of sandstone and give off a very 
different aura.  The atmosphere closely resembles a solar eclipse.  Numerous 
varieties of plants are able to grow in the valley due to the partial sunlight 
and the moist, rich soil.  Spherical objects magically appear and disappear 
through the steamy mist.  Cloaked Eldars move about on and off the road.  Their 
faces are hidden and unrecognizable except for their eyes and most of them 
carry staves made of bones.

Mountains, and the lumber from the forestry in the valley.  The blacksmith 
has built all of his own tools and weapons by hand.  A blaze burns in the 
blacksmith's forge near the rear of the building.  A large anvil sits on 
a pillar next to the forge, and a hammer lies on top.  Metal chains hang 
from rafters up above.  A tub of water is near the door that contains silver,

trade objects and materials inconspicuously in small groups.  The figures 
constantly mumble a strange language under their breaths.  Some of the cloaked 
figures sell exquisite lockboxes that are decorated with all types of rubies

quickly step back into the anonymity provided by the mist.

is the traditional archaic Eldar printbone pattern.  The aura of the glowing 
stones provides the only light.  The haze is so thick that you lose all depth 
perception.  Shadows and figures run by on all sides but no distinct figures 
can be made out.  The sound of large wings comes from above.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

The dark cave
  Entering the dark cave, an overwhelming feeling of dread and despair fills 
your being. Smells of rotten decay waft up from below with sounds that pierce
your being and make the hairs on your neck stand on end. You wonder if this 
adventure is really worth the rewards after hearing tales in the village

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

>>    Beautiful Hallway
  Here, the hallway is even more pleasant and welcoming...  If that's even
at all possible.  The ever-present carpet is just as comfortable and
luxuriant as always, and the walls are painted a deep, rich green that
overwhelms you with its resemblance to forests and grasslands.  West, an
immense, beautifully carved wooden door blocks your view.  The hallway just
keeps going to the east, eventually ending at another majestic door there. 
You see simple doors to the north and south, leading to the patients'
uniformly commodious quarters.

  This room is comfortably large.  To either side of the doorway is a
double-high capacious bed, piled high with colorful blankets and pillows. 
The head of each is a wooden cabinet space, carved in scenes of feasts and
festivals.  A window lets in natural light, and the comforting magic light
present everywhere else is stronger here, seeming to have healing and
regenerating properties...  The door through which you entered is the only
way out.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

  The water is so clear that the bottom can easily be seen.  Some small
seaweed is growing here, letting the waves guide its movement.  The sand is
very fine; not a single rock can be found here.  Water stretches in every

Shallow Water
  The water is so clear that the bottom can easily be seen.  Some small
seaweed is growing here, letting the waves guide its movement.  The sand is
very fine; not a single rock can be found here.  Water stretches in every
direction but north, where the beach of the island lies.

  The ocean lies to the west.  A soft breeze is blowing in from that
direction, carrying a salty taste with it.  Sand stretches to the east,
moved by the wind.  To the far north an embankment lies, protecting the
island from the ocean.  The sand here is moist, leaving all the various
footprints clearly visible.

The Moist Beach
  The ocean lies to the west.  A soft breeze is blowing in from that
direction, carrying a salty taste with it.  Sand stretches to the east,
moved by the wind.  To the far north an embankment lies, protecting the
island from the ocean.  The sand here is moist, leaving all the various
footprints clearly visible.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Walk of the Stars - Requiem
  This path through the stars seems to have been formed by magic from the
music of an imperial dirge.  The terrifying power of this song, played
whenever those who control the metallic moon go into battle, resonates not
with sadness for those lost, but with the reminder of the doom which awaits
any who oppose them.  This terrifying path winds a circle past Bunda, down
to Deneb and Gianfar, west between Chort and Spica, turning north near
Corona Aerianni, then east, meandering between Nasil and Zacuto to complete
its circuit.  Gianfar lies southeast of here, Deneb and Zaniah to the
southwest, while Absolvo Te is directly east from here, across the Antipodal
Celestial Meridian.

The Local Bar (G)
  The first thing you notice as you step into this bar is the strange 
assortment of patrons. A large, rather elephantine creature tends bar and 
eyes you quizzically. He uses his telepathic abilities to try to discern your
tastes and serves you a drink.

allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A Twisted and Cracked Ancient Road
  Lone and bare, the level sands stretch and twist to the edges of
vision.  Like slow ocean breakers they crash against the rocky shores of
this desert sea.  Ancient bleached bones sit like shipwrecks high upon the
rocks that thrust through the sandy waves, beckoning like sirens of old
those weary travellers to their thirsty doom.  A cracked and ancient road
rides through the wastes like a bridge over a troubled sea, twisting on
motionless waves of sand until it disappears into the haze of the east.  
A small weather beaten and blasted marker sits half buried by the all
encompassing sands.  Its barely legible words state '20 miles to Reme.'

Well Travelled Crossroads
  The road you have been following through the desert has arrived at a
great intersection, carved from the rock and the sands that seem to make up
most of this place.  A rusting iron cage hangs forlornly from a graying
wooden pole, squeaking in the harsh acid wind that blows across the sandy
wastes about you.  A few sullen vultures sit upon the pole, regarding you
strangely as you peer into the rusting iron of the cage and notice bleached
bones and rags that tell of past meals for these scavengers of the sky. 
Sand blasted expanses of road lead off in all directions, and along the one
to your east you can see the hazy spires of a mighty city thrusting upwards
from its sandy base.

This mine was built to last the years well indeed, and you might think it
working still if it were not for the bodies littering the floor, and the

Global Quest: Global Quest # 3596 has been won by Cavalera - 281st win.


Entrance to the Silver Mines
  This dark chamber, carved into the still living rock of this desert
hill, is crudely worked and shored.  Still, the great oaken beams that line
the walls and ceiling give both the impression of great strength and age. 
This mine was built to last the years well indeed, and you might think it
working still if it were not for the bodies littering the floor, and the
dark magical orbs that once gave light into this dark chamber.  A shaft
leads downwards into the depths of the earth, barred and locked with great
bands of silver and iron.

  The wooden stairs creak beneath your feet as you traverse the depths of

showing clearly that whomever is down here has good reason to prefer the
darkness and shadows to hide within.  The shaft continues down beneath you.

Mine Tunnel
  The tunnel runs in a straight line here, cutting well into the
darkness of the shaft, following an ancient seam of dark black ore that
still can be glimpsed in clumps present in the walls about you.  Flimsy
wooden pilings hold the ceiling at bay, and you begin to truly realize the
weight of earth they have to support.  You hurry down the tunnel, afraid of
this dark and oppressive place.

  This tunnel section is lit brightly by smokey pitch-burning torches. 
You can see that they were recently set into the walls, in roughly carved
wooden holders thrust into chiseled holes in the stone.  You can hear
movement ahead of you, to your north, and almost see something shifting
slowly through the hazy musty air.  Fear makes your blood run cold are you

  Slipping from shadow to shadow underneath the dim light of the flickering 
torches, you watch the gladiators in the camp ahead. One grotesquely scarred 
man holds a wooden practice sword, breathing harshly from bruised lips as he 
attempts with all his strength to bash another man in the head. Two more 
gladiators sit morosely around a fire, half heartedly glaring at the 
passers-by around them as they sharpen and oil their weapons against the damp
air down here. Ragged though their skin and clothes might be, still their 
steel holds well its edge, and their will holds great power. You grip the 
hilt of your weapon firmly as you prepare to stride into their midst.

litter the sandy floor of this subterrean campsite. The scarred eyes and ears
of those gladiators who inhabit this space follow you none too gently, 
accusing and challenging with their glare. Only the uncertainty of who you 
are and how you got past their sentries seems to hold them in check. Clearly 
they fear you might be someone of importance, and while they would not 
respect you for this, they would indeed fear the retribution of their leader 
should a guest of his be found 'discomfited' here. To your north a larger 
bonfire can be seen.

armor and clothes scattered about a small iron cookpot.  Weapons litter the
sandy soil here, stacked in readiness for a call to arms by their leader,
and grisly trophies tell you well indeed that these weapons have been well
used in recent times.  You walk past them with great care, trying to seem
unconcerned, lest they fall upon you as mad dogs upon a scared deer.  You
stumble northwards, towards a brightly lit section of the cave.

A Roughly Made Throneroom
  You stand in the middle of a richly decorated part of the cavern.  Rich
rugs and silken tapestries have been hung from the stalagtites of the cave,
reminding you of legends of Ali Baba and his treasure caves.  Sparkling
spires of stone have been rudely hacked into torch holders, and a great
crystal block in the center of the cave, once of great wonder and beauty,
has been smashed and dragged away to leave room for a crude wooden throne. 
The throne has had attached to its arms two skulls, with flesh still
clinging to their pitiful bones.  You begin to suspect that two more Reman
officers will not be reporting back to barracks tonight.  A small crack in
the cave wall leads to your east, and the cave opens up back to your south.

A Rough Campsite Underground
  The camp is larger here, with dozens of gladiators in their ragged
armor and clothes scattered about a small iron cookpot.  Weapons litter the
sandy soil here, stacked in readiness for a call to arms by their leader,
and grisly trophies tell you well indeed that these weapons have been well
used in recent times.  You walk past them with great care, trying to seem
unconcerned, lest they fall upon you as mad dogs upon a scared deer.  You
stumble northwards, towards a brightly lit section of the cave.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.
