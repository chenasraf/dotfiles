The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Outside the East Gate
  You are on a small dirt path outside the east gate of a village.  The
path seems infrequently used and disappears into the undergrowth ahead.  You
can hear the sounds of a stream to the west.  The trees in this part of the
forest seem to be evergreens: pine and spruces and firs.

Inside the East Gate
  You are inside the east gate of Cradlebrook.  People hurry along the
road, eager to get to their destinations.  The road within the village is
well-used, despite the poor trails outside - it seems the villagers like
to keep to themselves.  The walls of the village surround you to the
south, and the east gate is open.  To the west the cobbled street
continues.

There is a large gate to the south.

The Creek in the Village
  You stand in the cold waters of Last Mountain Creek.  It runs north, where
further down a bridge has been built.  You can see several villagers drawing
water in small wooden buckets, and more than one person sits on the banks with
line and lure, looking to catch a fish.  There is a wide roadway to the east,
and a slightly smaller one to the west.

  Around you are four walls of compressed dirt and sod, and a small wooden
door leads north onto the road.  This family appears poor - their scanty
possessions are no more than an old table and a few chairs, with nothing but
straw on which to sleep.  On the table is a pottery pitcher.  What little
light enters the room comes from a tiny window to the west.  From it you
can see nothing but the village walls.

A Small Road in Cradlebrook
  Beneath you is a small cobblestone road worn smooth and thin by years of use
by the villagers.  A simple stone house is west, the cobblestones leading to
its front door.  There seem to be fewer people here, the road worn but less
used than the one across the river.  A wooden footbridge leads east across
the river.  The cobblestones extend to the north and south.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
A villager stands here.
A surly looking youth passes you by.

Cradlebrook Market
  This appears to be the heart of the village.  All manner of stalls have been
set up, selling a wide variety of goods.  There is a constant flow of people in
and out of the market.  Women carry woven baskets over their heads.  Children
run and spar with sticks.  Men chat and haggle over the price of goods, eager
to get the best price they can.  A bridge traverses the creek to the west.
A sign hangs from the small store to the east, and the cobbled road continues

  You have entered into a small store.  The ceiling seems a bit low, though
the woman behind the counter, quite short, seems not to mind.  There are a few
racks of clothing here, and behind the counter you can see a back room with
what appears to be a loom and sewing supplies.  The clothes seem to be quite
utilitarian - strong, heavy cloth, and dyed to match the greens and browns of
the forest surrounding the village.

Mountain Creek.  There are a great many sounds in the air: shouting, laughing,
quarreling.  The forest is almost non-existent here, apart from a few trees,
and at your feet are long, thick grasses that have been trodden down by many
people.

  You are in the freezing waters of Last Mountain Creek.  Great timbers rise
up in front of you, separating only briefly to allow the water to arrive,
fresh and unfettered, at the village.  To the east there is a gate for those
who prefer a more conventional route.

>>   The Creek in the Village
  You stand in the cold waters of Last Mountain Creek.  It runs north, where
further down a bridge has been built.  You can see several villagers drawing
water in small wooden buckets, and more than one person sits on the banks with
line and lure, looking to catch a fish.  There is a wide roadway to the east,
and a slightly smaller one to the west.

On a Street in Cradlebrook
  You are on a wide cobbled street in the village.  People, carts, and
horses line the roadway, moving leisurely to wherever it is they are going. 
The creek runs to the west with the road continuing to the north and east. 
There is a large gate to the south.

  This appears to be the heart of the village.  All manner of stalls have been
set up, selling a wide variety of goods.  There is a constant flow of people in
and out of the market.  Women carry woven baskets over their heads.  Children
run and spar with sticks.  Men chat and haggle over the price of goods, eager
to get the best price they can.  A bridge traverses the creek to the west.
A sign hangs from the small store to the east, and the cobbled road continues
to the north and the south.

  You are standing in a large stone room.  Feels like a crypt.  Ancient
murals of Hell and punishment cover the walls.  In the middle of the room
are stairs that lead down in to the darkness.  From the stairway you can
smell brimstone and sulfur.  To the west it looks as if there is a shrine.

  What luck!  A room full of treasure.  Gold, diamonds, riches beyond
imagination!  Wait!  You suddenly feel as if it is all slowly disappearing. 
Someone is taking your treasure.  They have no right!  It is yours!  You
found it first.  Let them go get their own treasures!  You see a door to the

  The trail stops at the base of a very tall, rocky mountain. Looking around, 
there appears to be no other alternative than to return whence you came.
However, a glance upwards reveals that the rock wall has what appears to be 
foot and hand holds. It would take almost no effort at all to climb up to 
what appears to be a mountain ledge not ten feet above your head.

your face and arms annoyingly. The air is clean and crisp with the scent of 
pine. The trail leads west and south from here. A rustling in the undergrowth
signals the presence of something furtive following you.

A Path at the Foot of a Mountain
  The trail stops at the base of a very tall, rocky mountain. Looking around, 
there appears to be no other alternative than to return whence you came.
However, a glance upwards reveals that the rock wall has what appears to be 
foot and hand holds. It would take almost no effort at all to climb up to 
what appears to be a mountain ledge not ten feet above your head.

On a Mountain Ledge
  The wind whips your hair painfully across your exposed face as you stand 
precariously on the mountain ledge. To the north, the ledge widens before the
mountain wall. It looks as if the ledge might rise and continue to wrap 
around the mountain, forming a trail. An eagle soars above you but quickly 
disappears into a tall fir tree.

A Mountain Ledge
  The mountain ledge is a natural platform, with a sturdy granite base and 
bounded on the east and south sides by mortar and stone walls. There is an 
opening in the mountain wall to the west. The steep trail rises directly 
before you. The trail is so steep, you have to use hand and foot holds to 
climb up.

  You have entered the Keep of the Kobaloi, and are standing within the main 
cavern of the complex. From where you stand, you can see the cavern extends 
northwards towards a guarded gate. The air is clean, and cool, due to a fresh
breeze venting from the outside. There is a gate to the east, possibly 
leading to a side cavern.

Mountain Trail
  You are standing on a ledge that forms a trail around the mountain. It drops 
off below you into what looks like a sink hole but might be a cave. It rises 
directly before you and forms a switchback not far above you. You have to use
hand and foot holds to use the trail as it rises steeply upwards.

The Southeast Mountain Trail
  The trail levels out and leads along the east face of the mountain. A safety 
wall, built of stone and mortar, borders the trail across from the mountain 
face. Without it, one might easily fall several hundred feet and such a fall 
would surely be mortal.

Along the East Face
  The trail follows the mountain side, heading in a north and south direction 
along the east face. The mountain is generally solid rock but every once in a
while you run across a rock fall and have to climb over it. A north wind 
blows constantly, chilling your bare skin.

Along the East Face
  A north wind numbs your bare skin as you make your way along the mountain 
trail. The east face of the mountain is sheer, and you are faced with the 
risk of rock fall with every step you take. The air is very crisp and clean 
and the sky, when clear of cloud, as bright a cerulean blue as you have ever 
seen.

(for help on casting spells via scrolls, see 'help scrolls'.)

Syntax:  pagesize <number of lines>

The 'pagesize' command tells the MUD how many lines to display before the
pageprompt is displayed.  This allows you to control how much information
is on the screen at one time.  'pagesize 0' will disable the pageprompt;
'pagesize' by itself will show your current setting.

When the pageprompt shows, the following options are available:

   [Enter] : View next page.
   A       : View all of the output at once.
   B       : Go back a page.
   E       : View the remaining pages at once.
   L       : Skip to the last page.
   Q       : Quit the pager.
   R       : Refresh the current page.
   T       : Return to the top of the paged output.

You may customize the pageprompt; see 'help pageprompt'.  'scroll' is an
alias for 'pagesize'.

Having tags on will disable paging on some commands so that the output can
be captured by clients. See 'help tags' for more information on this.

Last Updated  : 2012-08-27 17:10:27.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax: recite <scroll> <target>

'recite' will attempt to read a magical scroll and cast its affects.  The
chance to successfully recite a scroll is based on your 'scrolls' skill.
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  If there is 
no target, recite will cast the scroll on yourself.  Unlike staves and
wands (which must be held to be used) scrolls should be in inventory but 
NOT held.

Note that certain spells can only be used from an object if you are a class
that can cast those spells. To check a specific spell, use 'showskill
<spellname>'. This command will show, among other things, if a spell is
restricted when on objects.  If you do not see a restriction, then the 
scroll is fine to use on anyone.

Scrolls only have a single charge; once they are read, the spells are used
and the scroll is consumed.  Any spell cast from a scroll is considered at
100% strength.  (See the paragraph about nofail in 'help multicast'.)

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

To the south, you gaze upon a large plaza with eight silver spires piercing

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of

evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

>>   Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more

antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic

of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  You stand on Whitewind Avenue just south of a large intersection with a
large statue and numerous people.  The city around you is incredible, with
amazing architecture, breathtaking horizons, and finely crafted roadwork. 
Beneath your feet, the road is a white, translucent stone, likely quartz,
that sparkles in the sunlight.  Traveling south will take you to the world
famous Meridian Square.

>>   Phoenix Square (G)
  At this, the main intersection of the Grand City of Aylor, the road is
shiny and black as if paved with ebony.  The road extends east and west,
reaching across the entire city.  In the center of this large square stands
a black and pink alabaster statue.  Beneath the statue, many solicitors try
to grab the attention of passersby.  To the north is the white marble temple. 
To the south, you gaze upon a large plaza with eight silver spires piercing
the sky.  

[ Exits: north east south west up ]
     A large black and pink statue sprays streams of water into the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  The ground does not appear to be getting any better.  You struggle to

sludge.  You press forward hoping for a better path, noting the sounds of
wildlife that begin to filter into your hearing.  A howl here, the cry of

  Your excitement mounts as you draw closer to the castle.  To your east
you hear the loud clang of steel coming from the forge.  To your west,
sounds of laughter and song carry through the air invitingly.  Perhaps
a bit of a nip before venturing forth to visit the king is in order here.

Castle Forge
  Intense heat assaults you as you enter the smithy, making sweat pop out
on your skin.  Roaring flames crackle in tune with the pounding of the
blacksmith's hammer, and the odor of heated metal fills your nostrils in an
almost stinging sensation.  Ingots of cold iron are neatly stacked in one
corner for easy access.  To the east you see a small tinker shop in a back
room of the forge.

  You stand at the steps of the opulent castle of the Kingdom of Ahner. 
The bustle of the courtyard is behind you, a faint tittering in the back of
your mind as you take a deep breath to gather your nerves.  Slowly you pull
upon the heavy door and take a step forward.

  You are getting closer to the stairway.  You can faintly detect the

fruit pies coming from the dining room.  You stand quietly until the silence

tragic sobbing that can only be coming from Morganna's room.  To the west,
you can hear faint murmurings of promises of love and devotion so one can
only assume it is the room of that rogue Rodney.

Hallway in the Castle
  You creep farther along the hallway hoping you are not caught by a
Dullurd soldier.  These quarters are definitely off-limits to the uninvited
and you are most certainly one of the uninvited.  To the east you can hear
tragic sobbing that can only be coming from Morganna's room.  To the west,
you can hear faint murmurings of promises of love and devotion so one can
only assume it is the room of that rogue Rodney.

wonder what mischief they are up to now.

  You are at the end of a long hallway, and you now stand at the bottom of
a long spiraling staircase that takes you to the private quarters of the

creak underfoot.  Bending to investigate, you notice a hidden trapdoor.

Walk of Death
  Darkness falls over every corner and a feeling of terror permeates the
air.  You strain your eyes to see to the end of the hallway, but all you can
see is the darkness.  You gag slightly as the smell of death reaches your
nose, and you shudder as you feel the hair on the back of your neck begin to
rise.  Terrified, you plunge forward, hoping that amidst the death and
horror you will find hope and life.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

| I was playing with colorset and noticed its not as funcitonal as it could be.
| I think we have great options for clarity/readability.
| 
| Currently when you walk in a room and there are 20 mobs/players you see a 
| wall of yellow(colorset) text which isn't very pleasing/distinguishable. 
| 
| Currently mobs/players whole line shows up as the colorset for mob/player.
| I'm suggesting changing /seperating player/mob from player/mob descript/title.
| 
| ***Currently:***
| Standing in room:
| Player1 and he's coming for YOU!!!!.
| Player2 Sene sovya caba'donde ain dovienya.
| Player3 (lots of colors here not coloring it)
| Player4 is here.
| Ebony Specter floats around, uninterested in your blood.
| 
| Fighting:
|  Player is fighting a frenzied sawfish.
|  A frenzied sawfish is fighting Player.
| 
| ***Suggested:***
| Adding a colorset option for descript/title:
| if for example I colorset playerdesc Yellow, and mobsdesc to white.
| Bear with me i know the colors are ugly but jsut an example)

  You stand on Whitewind Avenue before a large intersection with a massive
statue and numerous people.  The city around you is incredible, with amazing
architecture, breathtaking horizons, and finely crafted roadwork.  Beneath
your feet, the road is made of a white translucent stone, likely quartz,
that sparkles in the sunlight.  To the north, the grand Aylorian Temple
stands high above the city.

shiny and black as if paved with ebony.  The road extends east and west,
reaching across the entire city.  In the center of this large square stands
a black and pink alabaster statue.  Beneath the statue, many solicitors try
to grab the attention of passersby.  To the north is the white marble temple. 
To the south, you gaze upon a large plaza with eight silver spires piercing
the sky.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."  

[ Exits: north south west other ]
A gnomish incinerator bot is here, belching smoke and fire.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  You stand amidst a very crowded portion of Whitewind Avenue.  To the
north is a large mass of people who are waiting in line to speak with
Aylor's great and noble quest master.  To the south even more crowds
gather to find the treasures of Grandmarket Boulevard.

Welcome to Grandmarket Boulevard! (G)
  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

(White Aura) The local banker, Phreshnar, sits behind a table with a hole in the center.

Whitewind Avenue (G)
  You stand on Whitewind Avenue just south of Grandmarket Boulevard. 
Farther south, Whitewind meets up with Darksoil Path in a soft merging of
roadways.  The road here on Whitewind is as white as snow.  You cannot
imagine the thousands of footsteps that the road has endured, but it seems
no worse for wear.  In fact, the road is a pristine snow white and quite
beautiful.

  There is no visible light source in the cavern.  Even light brought in
anticipation of the darkness seems to wither and fail in the curse of this

  The cavern stops dead here.  The air is musty and thick with a sweet-sour
odor.......  An odor that is very familiar.  The sounds, haunting and
agitating, are unbearably loud.  The walls push in closer, tighter, in a
suffocating manner.  It seems as though every sense is purposely either
being deprived or attacked.

  The walls are tight, not even an arm's length of room.  The ceiling has
sloped low, barely enough room to stand upright.  The air is heavy, thick,
and the grit of this underground deathtrap hangs heavy in the air.  Sounds
continue the assault from all directions.  

        It seems as if all light has been sucked from this room.

Elven Slaves' Quarters
  The cavern is most cramped here in this corner.  The walls are the
dampest and coldest.  The feeling of despair, the most acute.  Those
enslaved here are desperately desiring death, yet there is no escape.
A crowd of slaves moves in, herding around you, surrounding you,
 
reaching, grabbing, pleading...

An elf, despairing of salvation, bangs his head against the cavern wall.

Kobold Slave Quarters
  The pen is crammed with bodies, writhing and colliding. The floor seems to be
undulating, as you wade through the slaves. There is barely enough light to 
see your way, but barely, you can make out the slave quarters continue to the
east, west and south.

 A crooked hand rises from the undulating bodies at your feet, grabbing
at your ankles.

A Lit Passageway
  The passageway opens to a large cavern to the south.  The water,
streaming in seams and cracks in the rock floor, separates and spreads like
branches on a tree.  There are torches on the far wall, barely casting
sufficient light to see.  Moans of suffering and a stench of fear pervade
the cave.

A Dimly Lit Passageway
  The rough passageway widens slightly here.  Pools of water splash beneath
your feet, soaking your boots.  The walls are rough and damp, and the air is
heavy with moisture.  Shadows dance on the wall, cast by the torches, and
animated by your own movement.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  You stand before a huge door.  The corridor can easily fit fifteen humans
standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door
stands to the west, the way to the surface is up.

Stone Archway
  A chilled breeze rushes through the dark, rough-hewn cavern. The walls are 
covered in scripts and glyphs, visible through an eerie glow that barely 
penetrates the darkness. Broken planks and discarded potion bottles litter 
the floor and a sign of some sort is engraved with a message.

Inside the Archway
  There is no visible light source in the cavern.  Even light brought in
anticipation of the darkness seems to wither and fail in the curse of this
place.  With every step, the walls seem to shrink in, making the air thick
and musty.  The sounds here echo all around with no definite source.

  The walls are tight, not even an arm's length of room.  The ceiling has

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

>>   Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more

mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the

do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look 
at them. To return to the Academy type north.

Playground
  Here they are!  Little girls dressed in brightly colored garb are
laughing and singing throughout an area set aside for play.  The toys look a
little more run down than they did in the first area, but appear to be well
maintained.  The blue swings sway gently in the breeze as the girls are far
more interested in playing Hide-n-seek.  While these children play
unattended, their parents shop.  Are they not aware of the hidden dangers in
this part of the Market?

through the middle of the market.  Sounds of children are definitely coming

anxious to get the best available, and at the best price.

of many male figures of different races, and peering closely, you see a few

leads no closer; however, there suddenly appears a gap in the press of

money surrounding the girls is also noticeable.  The way their bodies are

Before the East Entrance (G)
  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

>>   Fantasizing
  Closing your eyes, you feel yourself being transported into a new world,
one of fantasies both good and bad.  The Fantasy Fields stretch in many
directions, encompassing visions of delight and horror.  Where you stand,
the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

  Alas, it seems the strangeness of this world is too much for your mind to
handle.  Tearing your attention away from the realm of fantasy to open your
eyes partially, you see the world called 'reality' around you.  It is your
choice to wake up and allow that world to take over or to close your eyes
and enter Fantasy once again.

in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.

Boot Camp is, in essence, a clan made by experienced players for the purpose
of helping newer players. We take in newer players to help them along and 
give them a taste of what clan life is like until they either outgrow us or 
decide to stay with us as staff members.
 
Before applying you will need to have reached at least lvl 15 and have 
completed the Aardwolf Academy goal.
 
Our application process is pretty simple and should take a maximum of 1 week to 
complete. To begin the process start by posting a note on board personal 
to boot announcing your interest in joining, along with a little about 
yourself. An example application note can be found in HELP 
BOOT-APPLICATION.
 
After posting your note you will receive a reply note giving you further 
instructions on how to continue with your application process. 
 
If you are tier 3, 7x, 201 or higher in level and wish to apply as staff, 
you may begin your application process by simply writing us a note. We will 
respond with a note on how to continue.

The mandate of Boot is to help new players, therefore, once a member has
reached the level stated above (T3, 7x, 201), the player will be given
the choice to continue on as a staff member or be assisted in the transition
to a new clan life outside of Boot. It is assumed that by that level, Boot
has taught the player everything that they will need to know and in fact
they are a newbie no more.

When the 'score' command is used, one of the pieces of information displayed
is a character's age. The age of a character does not change its attributes 
in any way; it simply measures how many hours that character has been online
in a different fashion. 

Type 'swho 10' to see the who list sorted by hours online. This shows the 
players displayed in a range from oldest to youngest.

help color
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Colors Colours Ansi.
Help Category : Features.
Related Helps : Colorset, Rawcolors, Xterm.
Last Updated  : 2021-12-19 11:02:34.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:  color        - toggles current setting.
         color on/off - explicitly set color to on or off.

The 'color' command turns on/off MUD output coloring.  'ansi' is an alias
for 'color'.

The ANSI standard allows for 15 common colors that appear everywhere in
Aardwolf.  They are divided into normal and bright colors.

   @b / @B blue / bblue           @c / @C cyan / bcyan
   @r / @R red / bred             @m / @M magenta / bmagenta
   @g / @G green / bgreen         @w / @W white / bwhite
   @y / @Y yellow / byellow            @D gray (bright black)

Grey/bright black is not visible on all connections; use the 'seegray'
toggle to enable/disable seeing bright black.  There is no 'dark black'.

To use color codes in your title, communication, or whatever else you
write, prefix the color with '@' followed by the letter code.

For example, '@WColor @Gis @mCool.@w' will look like
              Color is Cool.               

It may help to END A SEGMENT OF COLORED TEXT WITH @w.  This changes 
the color of the text to low white.

To display an @ symbol, use @@.  @- may be used to display a tilde, though
the MUD no longer processes them and thus the standard tilde may be used.

Aardwolf allows you to customize your own independent color scheme for most
types of MUD output.  Type 'help colorset' to read about this feature.  The
syntax 'colorset colors' will display all 15 colors and their color codes
similar to the list above.

Aardwolf also supports xterm 256 color mode- see 'help xterm' for more
information.

Channels (discluding tells and echos) may have their color scheme returned 
to the channel's default color for all users after a color change has been 
displayed. To do this, simply use $C at the point where you would like to 
resume the channel's regular color. Note that it is difficult to actually 
display $C itself on a channel, e.g., for MUSHclient or CMUD a user can 
type $@ C. Also note that $C does not work in the note editor.

There are a number of clans that sell useful object containers as well as 
drink containers. Don't be concerned by the high level of the object 
containers; since there is no need to wear a container one that is level 
201 will hold more than a lower level container would. Below is a list that 
shows which clans sell containers and what each container is called. Once
you 'runto <clan>' from recall, type 'list' at any mobs you find to see if
they are selling the container you desire.

Object Containers:

Chaos       :  Malevolent {chaos} Luggage
Seekers     :  (Seekers) Urn of Awakening

Touchstone  :  (>Touchstone<) Rock Collecting Bag

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Towering Waterfall (G)
  A towering waterfall soars above the surrounding forest and continues
as a river flowing towards the east. The constant roar of falling 
water pounds your ears as chaotic mists spiral, twist and turn about 
you. The light from The Three Moons - Nuitari, Lunitari and Solinari - 
create a dazzling array of colors which invade your senses. Yellows,
violets, reds and blues fade into one another and together with the 
chaotic mists create a reality void of definition, form and substance. 
While searching within the mists of chaos, you are able to hear the 
faint sounds of music pierce through the roar of the falling water. 
Following the sounds to the far end of waterfall, an ancient stone 
structure emerges from the mists.

  You stand on Whitewind Avenue before a large intersection with a massive
statue and numerous people.  The city around you is incredible, with amazing
architecture, breathtaking horizons, and finely crafted roadwork.  Beneath
your feet, the road is made of a white translucent stone, likely quartz,
that sparkles in the sunlight.  To the north, the grand Aylorian Temple
stands high above the city.

>>   The Temple of the Moons (G)
  The only room within the ravaged structure is painted in an ancient script 
depicting the glory of The Three Moons. Candles illuminate intricate 
tapestries which illustrate the rich myths surrounding Nuitari, Lunitari and 
Solinari. While admiring the beauty of this ancient place, beams of light 
from The Three Moons arch, spiral and twist around you; as if on a whim.
Knowing that light does not behave this way, you come to the realization that
an ancient magic is revealing itself. Following the music, you come across a 
great window into the sky. As beams of ethereal moonlight drift down into the
room, the air around them becomes distorted and heavy. A tendril of magic 
sprouts from the ground and your teacher, the Great Mentor of Chaos, is 
revealed as the source of the music.

[ Exits: down ]
Your teacher, the Great Mentor of CHAOS, looks at you with pride as you prove yourself to The Three
Moons.

Following the River (G)
  Every step is forced, every breath labored as you follow the meandering
river into the dark forest. Brimming with sweat, you gaze upward and 
realize that only The Three Moons, blazing in their glory, will 
lead you to your destination. Praying too them, they begin a slow and
spiraling convergence in the sky and once united their light illuminates
a rough stone path for you to follow. The rough path rises and continues
as a small stone bridge. Thick vines and violet flowers encase the bridge
and in the Light of The Moons, the flowers open and release an intoxicating
aroma that permeates the damp, heavy air. Just as quickly, the flower 
petals fall into the river and are carried off into the darkness by the 
swift current. On the other end of the bridge the stone path splits, with 
one leading further into the darkness and the other towards a dim light.

A Towering Waterfall (G)
  A towering waterfall soars above the surrounding forest and continues
as a river flowing towards the east. The constant roar of falling 
water pounds your ears as chaotic mists spiral, twist and turn about 
you. The light from The Three Moons - Nuitari, Lunitari and Solinari - 
create a dazzling array of colors which invade your senses. Yellows,
violets, reds and blues fade into one another and together with the 
chaotic mists create a reality void of definition, form and substance. 
While searching within the mists of chaos, you are able to hear the 
faint sounds of music pierce through the roar of the falling water. 
Following the sounds to the far end of waterfall, an ancient stone 
structure emerges from the mists.

[ Exits: east up down ]
     (Magic) You see the shadowy outline of a bed before you.
     (Magic) A gold and silver fountain
     A small campfire burns merrily away here.
Cynthia, High Priestess of the Three Moons, waits here to heal thy woes.
The Father of CHAoS stands here, watching over you.

Whitewind Avenue (G)
  You stand on Whitewind Avenue before a large intersection with a massive
statue and numerous people.  The city around you is incredible, with amazing
architecture, breathtaking horizons, and finely crafted roadwork.  Beneath
your feet, the road is made of a white translucent stone, likely quartz,
that sparkles in the sunlight.  To the north, the grand Aylorian Temple
stands high above the city.

you 'runto <clan>' from recall, type 'list' at any mobs you find to see if
they are selling the container you desire.

Medical lounge (G)
  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second 
Lieutenant Pixie with a red cross on her hat here.

[ Exits: east (down) ]
     A refrigerated milk cooler stands ready to serve all.
     Multiple beds line the wall, waiting for people to rest or be treated on them.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

[ Exits: north east (south) west up down ]
A Grumpy Old General stands here, shouting orders at the new recruits.

  Walking into the room, you notice there is a relaxed, friendly atmosphere and
almost everyone is in military uniform. A jukebox is playing a lively tune 
and some of the patrons are having fun dancing to the music. The sound of 
laughter coming from one end of the bar, as someone has just delivered the 
punch line of a good joke. Plush, comfortable looking, couches are scattered 
around the large room in clusters of two and three, allowing for more 
intimate gatherings and private conversations. The enlisted and the officers 
mingle together amicably and everyone is on excellent terms with the 
bartender.

[ Exits: east south west ]
An old veteran stands behind the bar, ready to serve you a cool drink.

Base of the Monolith
  You make your way through the small opening into a dark dank cave.  Small
lichens grow along the walls and you can hear the faint drip of water.  You
focus on the drips as your eyes adjust to the darkness.  Stalactites extend
down from the ceiling with rivulets of water coming off of them.  The drops
of water condense into pools along the bottom of the rounded walls.  In the
center of this cave a large monolith's base stands.  The monolith extends up
through the opening in the center of the cave.  A ladder seems to have been
carved into this massive monolith.

  As you make your way along the etched ladder you find yourself in an open
expanse.  The monolith somehow supports a large circular platform made from
rock that seems equidistant in all directions.  Twelve stones, each with a
strange marking, are evenly spaced in this circle.  The marks coincide with
deep markings etched on the monolith.  Well worn paths lead from the etched
markings on the monolith and the small stones surrounding it.

  You have never been in a room with two of everything.  Two chairs, tucked
against opposite sides of two tables.  Two windows, symmetrically equal, in
each wall, located exactly the same distance from each wall as the distance
from each other.  Two Eggs, recently hatched, the shells broken open at the
same points, each in the nest of a giant goose.  You look to your side, and
for a split second, could've sworn you saw an exact replica of yourself!  A
decorative card is placed on each table, no doubt with the same inscription
on either, left or right.

The Battle of Lake Regillus
  Equites flash across the steep walls of an ancient volcanic crater.  They
hack into javelin-wielding foot soldiers of the Latin Camp.  Etruscans that
are already in disarray, lead a bloody disorganized retreat.  Trumpet-calls
sound from two men on horse, cloaked in the crimson of the Roman forces and
capped with white helms decorated with long horse-hair crests.  In a matter
of hours, blood has slicked the cracked, dried earth caking the bowl of the
crater, haling the return of the rains to fill the lake bed battlefield.

A defeated Etruscan marches a bloody path home, far to the south.
A staunch company of Latin Infantry holds back a tide of death on Roman soil.
Charging Roman Equites are sweeping up the mess with a bold flanking maneuver.

there.

heh. Unless that Crusaders weapon is an axe.

INFO: Corben has been reborn as a Shadow Ranger.

[Newbie] (Helper) Epsilon: An axe might not always be the best weapon available though - the "check
eqsearch" suggestion still stands.

[Newbie] Vexxar: weapon

INFO: The player rankings have been updated.

[Newbie] (Helper) Ayasinda: have you learned about the Find All command yet in the academy?

lessons - that'll send you by the weapon shop anyway.

[Newbie] (Helper) Epsilon: I think it's two more. Economy class.

[Newbie]: Epsilon nods quietly to himself.  What a wacko.

[Newbie] (Helper) Epsilon: hmm. Yup.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  Water drops slowly from a cracked boulder, steaming away as much moisture
as falls into a small stone basin carved by the relentless drops.  It seems
pure and clear, despite the dirty salt crystals that poison the ground
nearby.  A few shrubs grow here, and a tall cactus bears the shrivelled
remains of the nest of an owl, torn to tatters by the wind and sand.  All
this reminds you that life continues to exist, even in this desolate place.

Mountains Near the Ocean
  Shadows dart between the thick trunks of the pine and spruce which grow
thickly on the mountain sides.  Sounds of wildlife seem to surround the
area; a mountain goat's hooves clattering on stones, a small chittering,
perhaps a chipmunk frightened from its burrow, even a rustling, a sound like
that of a foraging bear.  The scent of salt water carries on in the chill
air, and the sounds of the ocean crashing against the very foot of the
mountains come from the north.  Nearly all light is blocked by the branches
of the trees, and while the trees themselves also block most of the wind,
there is enough whispering among the thick trunks to carry an icy mist
through the dim shadows.  There are fewer trees to the east, which makes it
easy to climb out of the mountains into low rolling hills.  Further east,
just visible on the horizon, the ocean meets the sky.

standing side by side here.  The floor has levelled off and has been worn
smooth by the dragging feet of the slave flocks.  You stand just before the
Underdark.  The Underdark is a huge city that rivals its surface
counterpart, Aylor.  From what you have heard, anything goes in the
Underdark.  A dangerous place at best, only those who have had at least ten
levels of experience should venture into it.  On the wall to the north are a
series of markings that you can't make out at this distance.  A huge door

  You stand just at the east entrance to the Underdark.  Before you looms a
huge cavern, or so you think, since you can't tell with your eyes.  Darkness
is everywhere, there is a layer of light that has been formed by a series of
floating orbs that rest above your head.  Above this layer of light, darkness
lies.  It is because of this that you think you stand in a huge cavern.  The
air smells of thousands living in a confined space with little fresh air.  The
air itself is moist and warm.  Sounds assault your ears, not just the buzzing
of people, but also agonized screams.  The shadows seem to speak of
death.  Welcome to the Underdark.

Sunrise
  You stand on Sunrise the eastern most street in the Underdark.  The street
name is a joke on those surface dwellers who may crave the sun.  Sunrise
travels along the eastern cavern wall.  The Underdark is a huge city
compared to Aylor.  The city that was founded has grown to fill the
cavern and thrives in the dark.  Over half the people who live here can see
in the dark, the floating orbs were placed for the surface dwellers so they
could kinda see.

  You are walking along Sunrise, a clean and broad street.  Small floating
orbs light the way, casting a surrealistic haze all around you.  The
sounds of the city bounce off the cavern wall to the east and find their way
into your ears.  The smell of sweat engages your nose.  A dark forbidding
thought enters your head, the shadows begin to come alive.  Always, just out of
your sight, a shape flits in and out of the shadows.

  This is the cage, this is where they keep a couple very dangerous monsters
that once roamed the caverns and tunnels before the city was founded. 
The floor is rough and the walls drip with water.  It is very cool in this
simulated cavern.  The cavern is about twenty feet by forty feet and the
ceiling rests twenty feet above the ground.

The cavern continues to the west, there is a door to the north.

A revenant wanders the street searching for revenge.

A Crack in the Rock
  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.  

[ Exits: up down ]
A deathly pale man looks around anxiously.

A Crack in the Rock
  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.

A Crack in the Rock
  You find yourself wedged in a crack just below the catacombs.  Strange
sounds come up from below.  Are the rumors true?  Are there dark forces
lurking within the granite depths?  If so, perhaps you should turn back now.
Unfortunately, the rock above does not seem to want to let you pass back
that way.  You peer into the gloom and see a path leading downward.  Your
only companion is a strange looking fellow whimpering softly.

south.  Is the music of violins emanating up from below?

  You have entered a well-lit and spacious cave with a very high ceiling. 
The illumination is provided partially by magical lamps jutting from the
walls.  Their light is soft white with a bluish tinge.  In the center of
this pleasing hall sits a psychedelic dragon.  The dragon gives off a light
of its own.  Although you think you might like to tarry here, you note paths
leading north and west.

  The lava continues thick and red.  Occasionally you run across a minor

of animal furs in one corner to sleep on.  Bones of unlucky travelers can
also be seen scattered about.  A couple of males work while the female roars
and snorts.  You hope she doesn't see you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Aardwolf Sleeping Bag is a special trivia item that can be bought from
Ravi.  The Trivia Sleeping Bag costs 15 trivia points; this is due to the
fact that it provides the best healing rate of any furniture on Aardwolf.

The Trivia Sleeping Bag has another unique property; because of its value,
it is not dropped and used like other furniture.  Simply wear the sleeping
bag, and you will automatically use it when you sleep.  Because of this
feature, you will not see 'You go to sleep in a Trivia Sleeping Bag' as 
with other furniture, only 'You go to sleep.'  Others looking in the room
will see you sleeping in the sleeping bag.

You may still sleep on other furniture by typing 'sleep <object>', but will
not benefit from the enhanced healing rates of the sleeping bag while doing
so.  To wake from a sleeping bag, use 'stand' or 'wake' as with any other
furniture.


Though you wear a sleeping bag, it is not like other equipment and cannot
have stats added.

Your body softens.

Your pulse slows to a normal rate.

Your mystic might fades away.

INFO: Korendir has removed himself from the (OPK) victim pool!

You can no longer sense anger.

The blood violins of Zangar begin another slow mournful serenade.

Lair of the Blithersnag
  This is just a typical blithersnag lair.  It's fairly cozy, with a pile
of animal furs in one corner to sleep on.  Bones of unlucky travelers can
also be seen scattered about.  A couple of males work while the female roars
and snorts.  You hope she doesn't see you.

The Puppet and the Dwarf
  What an odd place to find a tavern.  But that is exactly what this seems
to be.  Or at least half a tavern.  A bar is cut into the rock and a rusty

A Mineral Labyrinth
  Leaving the tavern you wonder if you have not taken too much drink. 
Paths lead east and west in the most arbitrary of fashions.  No signpost
stands here to aid your decision.  The mineral abundance mesmerizes you. 
Rare jewels and unknown ores ogle you from the cracks and seams of these
caverns.  Odd little creatures tramp by as well, some carrying sparkling
trophies.

Starlight Way - West (G)
  The starry path continues to the east and west through the city.  As you
pass its inhabitants, you notice that many of the district's occupants have
a rough and tough demeanor.  Many of the travellers are scarred or missing
appendages.  Many of the elders are wise and have an enchanting nature to
them.  Little inspires you to greet these people, for you fear they may be
looking for a fight.

Academy Courtyard
  Your first glimpse of the academy courtyard leaves you with the impression of
grandeur and sartorial splendor. Trees dot the courtyard, casting shade 
across the grass and flagstone paths. The path beneath your feet leads north 
around the gurgling fountain, and south to the outside world. If you're new 
to the Realm, you should head north to begin your lessons.

around the room seem calming but almost foreboding.  The windows, accented
in gold, are brightly painted to portray handsome yet intimidating scenes.

North of the Grand Plaza (G)
  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

Inside the East Gate
  You are inside the east gate of Cradlebrook.  People hurry along the
road, eager to get to their destinations.  The road within the village is
well-used, despite the poor trails outside - it seems the villagers like
to keep to themselves.  The walls of the village surround you to the
south, and the east gate is open.  To the west the cobbled street
continues.

  You are on a wide cobbled street in the village.  People, carts, and
horses line the roadway, moving leisurely to wherever it is they are going. 
The creek runs to the west with the road continuing to the north and east. 
There is a large gate to the south.

Cradlebrook Market
  This appears to be the heart of the village.  All manner of stalls have been
set up, selling a wide variety of goods.  There is a constant flow of people in
and out of the market.  Women carry woven baskets over their heads.  Children
run and spar with sticks.  Men chat and haggle over the price of goods, eager
to get the best price they can.  A bridge traverses the creek to the west.
A sign hangs from the small store to the east, and the cobbled road continues
to the north and the south.

>>   Telsa's Cloaks and Clothes
  You have entered into a small store.  The ceiling seems a bit low, though
the woman behind the counter, quite short, seems not to mind.  There are a few
racks of clothing here, and behind the counter you can see a back room with
what appears to be a loom and sewing supplies.  The clothes seem to be quite
utilitarian - strong, heavy cloth, and dyed to match the greens and browns of
the forest surrounding the village.

Edge of the Mountains
  The hills are turning into mountains here, and trees are replacing what
was once grassland on both sides of the road.  The road is degenerating into
nothing but a rocky path, and the way is hard going.  A breeze whistles
through the pines here, and the entire scene looks as if it belongs on a
postcard one might send to a Aylor relative.

Syntax: kill <target>
        murder <target>

This is the simplest way to initiate combat with your opponent. 'kill' will
start combat, which continues until either of you is dead, has fled or
something else has happened.  When meeting new monsters, it is generally
thought wise to 'consider' them before fighting; see 'help consider'.

You may not always want to kill the first instance of a monster in the
room; see 'help mobtargeting' to learn how to target different monsters.

In order to kill a guard of your own clan, you must 'murder' it.  Note that
this will give you a traitor flag (see 'help traitor').

Syntax:

    cast '<spell name>' <target>
    cast <spell number> <target>


Summary:

Type cast 'spell name' <target> to cast a spell on the target.
Leaving off the target will either cast the spell upon yourself while not 
in combat, or your enemy while in combat.

Spell numbers are also accepted with this command. Spell numbers can be 
found using the showspell command. (ie: 'showspell bless')


Detail:

Once you learn a spell, you may use it at any time by casting it.  Whether
or not you will successfully cast the spell depends on whether or not you
have practiced it (see 'help practice').  If you lose concentration, simply
try casting it again.  Casting spells costs mana.  The mana costs of some
spells decrease as your level increases; type 'spells' to see the mana
cost for your spells.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell
name.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells, and you can abbreviate
the spell name (e.g., c 'cure crit').  As a shortcut for casting, you may
use the spell number (shown in 'showskill') rather than the spell name;
'c sanctuary <target>' and 'c 71 <target>' are identical.  This can be
particularly useful on spells with similar names, such as lightning bolt 
and lightning strike.

See 'help targeting' for using specific targets for spells.  However, most
spells will have a default target if none is specified- beneficial spells
will usually target yourself, and combat spells will target your current
opponent if already in combat.

Your primary-class spells will generally cast faster than other spells.
Most combat spells also have a chance of extra hits, and some do damage
based upon how skilled you are in the spell; see 'help multicast'.

Area affect spells will not target players.  To purposely target enemy
players with area-affect spells, use 'cast <spell> all'.

See 'help <spell name>' for help on a particular spell.

Primary-class spells will cast quicker than other spells, often being able
to be used more than once in a round.

Almost all combat spells (primarily those which do not have other affects)
have a chance of extra damage/hits from a single cast.  You have a much 
higher chance of getting extra bonus casts from a primary-class spell,
though it may also happen on non-primary-class spells as well.  This is
often based upon your Luck as well as the spell's primary stats (and other
factors, such as the moons and alignment).  Some skills which have a daze
affect (e.g., bash, headbutt, etc.) will negate this ability for a short
period of time.

When casting spells that have a primary class set, the stats that determine
multi-cast chances have changed:

    Mage, Psi      : Int
    Warrior, Thief : Not casting classes, defaults to int.
    Cleric         : Wis
    Ranger         : Con and Wis, equal weighting.
    Paladin        : Con and Int, equal weighting.

The affect of luck has not changed and the chance of bonus casts for using
a primary spell vs non-primary have not changed. If a spell has no primary
stat set, int is the default. Skills are not affected by this- skills
already use whatever stat makes the most sense for them.

mist are the corpses of trees, stumps of cypresses rotting at the roots and 
carrying frothy remnants of hanging vines from their bare branches.

  You stand at the edge of a vast swamp of swirling mud and muck. The air is 
thick with the odiferous output of swamp gas and decay - odors that might 
please a dog, wolf or wolverine, but to any biped, sufficient to gag and 
disgust. Only a fool, or one with no nose at all, would wade in further.

  The muck and murk of the swamp is knee-high to an elf, eliminating for any 
walking race the possibility of easily choosing a next safe step. A mist 
rises above the muddy ground waist-high to a human and the river that feeds 
the swamp is obscured, nowhere to be seen. Only a few bare stumps rise out of
the mist, standing lonely sentinel.

  Here is the most dilapidated bridge you have ever seen!  Its weathered
grey planks are splintered and broken and more than half of them are
missing.  You look over the edge to see the rotting pilings sunk deep into
the mud banks.  Apparently, there is no other way across.  Gathering your
courage, you take one slow, careful step out onto the bridge.  It shudders
and groans under your weight.  I hope you make it across!

missing.  You look over the edge to see the rotting pilings sunk deep into
the mud banks.  Apparently, there is no other way across.  Gathering your
courage, you take one slow, careful step out onto the bridge.  It shudders

insects.

  Closing your eyes, you feel yourself being transported into a new world,
one of fantasies both good and bad.  The Fantasy Fields stretch in many
directions, encompassing visions of delight and horror.  Where you stand,
the grass is green and a cool breeze blows.  Thundering sounds of the
waterfall nearby echo around you, almost but not quite drowning out the
gentle trickling of the creek beside you that self-same waterfall feeds.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  Sparse fruit trees straggle from the ground.  Many are dead or dying, and
the ones that remain bear small and sour fruit.  Several trees are blown
over, leaving rotting logs which fill the air with the sour stench of
fungus.  A dark grove, surrounding a tower, lies to the southeast.

  Standing before the main entrance of the Aylorian Academy, you can't help but
notice the sheer scale of the structure. Many famous adventurers have passed 
through these gates before you and many will follow. The mark you will leave 
on this realm is to be determined by your actions, by fate, by skill and by 
chance.

Approaching the Camp
  To the northeast, the snow-shrouded bulk of the long dormant volcano
dominates the horizon.  Even at this distance, the fearsome winds of the
upper slopes are made visible through the wisps of snow streaming from the
peak.  There are two constants in this frozen wasteland - the terrible cold,
so intense it easily penetrates clothing, flesh, sinew and bone, and the
wintry landscape, a pallid white as far as the eye can see.  Here and there
a skeletal tree, branches encased in ice, provides some small respite from
the dreary continuity.  A wide swath of snow has been tramped down by the
passing of dozens of booted feet.  It leads off to the east where a camp of
some sort can be seen, a trickle of rising smoke giving evidence of
habitation.
