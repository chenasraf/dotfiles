The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  The very air seems to resonate with an electrical intensity inside the
Mages' Guild.  Groups of novices move throughout the tower, making their way
to this or that class, while experienced Spellcasters take advantage of the
libraries or perhaps use the common room as a place to catch up on some
reading.  Familiars are also in evidence-- many of them the sort of onyx
felines that gave the tower its nickname-- running, flying, slithering, or in
some cases oozing in pursuit of some errand given them by their masters. 
The upper levels of the tower are accessed by a series of levitation tubes
that gently pull entering sorcerers up to the next level of the tower.  The
Tower of Sorcery is a place of exotic enchantments and curious cantrips
where wizards of all stripes can find something to learn if pride will let
them be taught.

The Grand Plaza
  The air in the southeast corner of the plaza seems constantly charged
with magic.  The Tower of the Mind to the east houses the Guild of
Psionicists, its stones supposedly individually laid using only psychic
will.  To the south is the Tower of Sorcery, colloquially referred to as
Black Cat Tower, which houses the Mages' Guild.  This tower's appearance is
by far the most extreme of all, with several of its higher spires completely
detached from the main structure and floating in the air.  Powerful
sorcerers levitate out from the central edifice at impossible heights in
order to reach the magically-suspended satellite towers where only the most
exalted of the Guild are allowed to congregate.  Like the other guild towers,
these are guarded against outsiders.  Here and there herbalists shout the
lists of exotic spell ingredients they have for sale, while mentalists offer
up a panoply of concentration aids.

Syntax:  tpspend <option>  (See below.)

For many of the options available with trivia points, mobs have been
specially coded in Aylor that will take care of things for you without
needing to see an imm. Read 'help trivia points' for information on other
trivia point spending options and for a list of ways to get trivia points.

The 'tpspend' command allows you to spend trivia points at the Ravi
Enterprises office, which is located within the Aylorian Temple of Ivar,
north of recall. (runto ravi)

The following options are available through the tpspend command:

(Please be careful to check the syntax when using this command.  Refunds
will not be given.)

aura is the Aura of Trivia (see 'help aura of trivia'). (6TP) 

bag is the Trivia Sleeping Bag (see 'help sleeping bag'). (15TP)

bcp will give you a chaos portal ingredient.  There is a very rare 
chance this ingredient will be silver, platinum, or diamond.  (See 'help 
cptypes' for more information.) (5TP)

corpse will bring all retrievable corpses in the game to you. (1TP)

name <item> <keyword> adds a keyword to an item at a cost of 1 tp.  
The item must be in inventory, not worn or in a container.  Do not use 
color codes- this is the 'use' names, not the 'look at' descriptions.  See 
'help strings'. (1TP)

potion is the trivia spellup potion (level 220 sanctuary plus all three
Imm spells (see below)). (2TP)

remarry will remove your marriage timer, allowing you to immediately 
be able to marry again, removing the 'thirty day or remort/tier' 
restriction. (10TP)

restore will restore your hp/mana/moves to full.  (Contact an Imm to do
a global restore, which restores all players.) (2TP)

sex will permanently change your gender. Make sure you are not under
any other sex-changing affects; see 'help sex' for more information. (5TP)

spellup is the trivia spell-up cast directly on your character.  It will
include sanctuary, combat mind, bless, fly, divine faith, and one of the
three random Imm spells (see below). (1TP)

token removes a trivia point from your character and adds a trivia 
point token to your inventory.  It costs 100,000 gold coins to convert a 
trivia point into a token.  See 'help trivia token' for more details.  
(Note, this command is logged; transferring trivia points to an alt is 
considered multiplaying and against the rules- see 'help multiplaying'.)
(100,000 gold)

Imm spells include Valgard's Might, Shifty's Sleight of Hand, and Creator's
Wisdom.  If you are already affected by the random Imm spell that is cast
during the trivia spell-up, it is wasted; you do not get a different spell
instead.

The owner of an Aura of Trivia may sell it for two trivia points by visiting
Ravi in Aylor and using the syntax 'tpspend sell aura'.

Various other trivia functions can be carried out at specialized stores run
by Ivar Enterprises.  (See 'help trivia points' for more explanations and
related help files.)  These shops are located in the west plaza off

Syntax: quest request|complete|fail|list   (at questmaster)

        quest points|time|info             (anywhere)

If you find a questmaster, you can ask him/her to send you on a personal
quest to kill a particular monster.  Doing so and returning to complete the
quest yields (at least) gold and quest points, two very useful currencies
in Aardwolf.

To request a quest, go to a questor ('find quest' in Aylor, though there
are many others) and 'quest request'.  Go to the area listed and find and
kill the target (it will be easy to spot, with [QUEST] appearing after 
its description in the room), and then return to a questmaster and 'quest
complete'.

Completing a quest rewards some gold based upon your level, as well as some
quest points, an extra quest point per tier (see 'help tier'), two extra
points if you are using MCCP (see 'help mccp'), and possibly additional
bonuses- more quest points, trains, practices, and/or a trivia point.

Once you complete a quest, you may quest again in 30 minutes of online
time. If you can't find your target or don't want to do the quest given, 
you can 'quest fail' at a questor to fail the quest.  You only have to 
wait 15 minutes after a failed quest to quest again. When you fail a quest 
because you run out of time, you can immediately quest again. If you "fail"
a quest because you accidentally quit / get disconnected then it will be 
considered a regular 15 minute quest fail. 

You may use 'quest time' (which tells your time remaining until next quest
or time remaining on current quest) and 'quest info' (which tells your
current quest or time until next quest) anywhere.  You may also put the
amount of time until next quest in your prompt- see 'help prompt'.

Amongst other things, quest points are useful for buying special quest
equipment from questors.  See 'help quest items' for a list of these
items.  Use 'quest list' at a questor to see the list of items that are
available.  (Details on each item are covered in 'help quest items'.)  Use
'quest buy <item>' and 'quest sell <item>' to buy and sell quest equipment
from a questor.  You may also 'quest appraise <item>' to see item stats
before purchasing it.  Also see 'help remort auction' for an alternative
way of buying and selling quest equipment.


Questing is an individual effort; if a group member kills your quest mob,
you will not get credit.  Though quest targets are always picked based
upon your current level, that does not mean there won't be other (possibly
higher-level) monsters or other obstacles in the way.  Once in a great
while, you may think you have found the right target but it does not have
the target flag or give credit; this is not a bug- see 'help mobkeys'.

Last Updated  : 2022-10-03 23:52:40.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quest points are extremely popular and useful on Aardwolf.  Through the use
of quest points, you can:

* Buy high-damage weapons and armor with special effects (see 'help quest
  equipment').
* Buy wishes to enhance your character (see 'help wishes').
* Purchase mastery or potential (see 'help mastery' or 'help potential').
* Convert quest points into trivia points (cost is 150 quest points at a
  questor, type 'quest list' to display quest buy options) to raise gold, 
  enhance weapons, rename items, and several other things (see 'help 
  tpspend').
* Become a superhero (and be able to remort)- 500 or 750qps each remort
  except the first (see 'help superhero').
* Bid on other people's quest equipment in remort auctions (see 'help
  rauction').
* Get married (see 'help marriage').

There are several ways to gain quest points.

* Doing regular quests (see 'help quest').
* Donating money to help keep Aardwolf running (see 'help donate').
* Taking part in global quests (see 'help global quest').
* Winning lasertag (see 'help lasertag').
* Taking part in campaigns each level (see 'help campaign').
* Taking part in special Imm quests and competitions that are posted to 
  the Mudinfo board when available.
* Selling items on remort or long-term auction (see 'help rauction' and
  'help market' respectively).
* As a random bonus from daily blessing (see 'help daily')..

Please note: Quest points are extremely valuable. If you are new to
Aardwolf, it is recommended that you do not convert them into trivia 
points.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Task 1  : Find out who caused the castle's disappearance. (Completed)

Discover who was responsible for the disappearance of the ancient wanderer's 
home and return to him with his name.

Task 2  : Find a way to defeat Mage Madigan.

An aged wanderer says, "Is that right? I have heard of this madman and his 
envious hatred of my liege lord. He is a powerful magician, impossible for 
mere mortals to defeat. Perhaps you know how to find him, and devise a way to
defeat him. It's up to you. I am too old and decrepit to do more than eat my 
heart out over this. 

Task 3  : Find the genie and gain his trust. (Completed)

Mad Mage Madigan says, " The genie of the lamp has trapped me here in this
 prison.  Find him and discover what magic words will release me.  You must
 gain his trust to do this. Come back with his wand and help me escape. 
 You need not worry for yourself.  You may leave in the manner by which you
 came.  Come back to me here and tell me the words, and I will reward you
 well."

The genie's voice echoes triumphantly in your head, 'Return to me 
immediately. I am well pleased with you.

Task 4  : Kill 25 of Mage Madigan's evil minions. (Completed)
          Minions left to kill: 0

Task 5  : Do something about Mad Mage Madigan!

The genie of the lamp says, "You have proven your worth many times over. 
You seem to be a trustworthy accomplice." Staring upwards, the genie 
of the lamp chants, "pach nocto unus, a peaceful night, forever, that is the 
wizard's fate."

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

A Ferocious Sandstorm (G)
  A sudden barrage of flying sand grains makes it hard to see which way
to go next.  Just keeping a straight unblinking gaze is next to impossible,
let alone finding a way forward.  Staying, though, would mean a change in
career from adventurer to sculpture.  Better find a way out of this storm
fast.

Unforgiving Heat
  A high rocky outcropping provides a perfect wall blocking the stinging and 
grit of the recent desert sandstorm. Surprisingly, the air now is still, 
almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be
an understatement. A long tall glass of water would be welcome but there is 
none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a 
wish.

An Endless Sea of Sand (G)
  A cliff falls steeply to the north, making that way quite impassible. 
The horizon beyond is a shimmery wave of haze, hills merging in the dust
with the pale distant sky.  A sandy crest leads east and west, and to the
south there is something not quite natural, jutting out of the sand.

  Sand is flying everywhere, and the wind seems to shift direction every few
seconds.  The sand is hot from the sun, with barely any chance to cool off
at night.  With the shifting winds, the sand seems to get everywhere.  There

these harsh conditions.

Sinking sands
  A pool of soft sand has formed between two crests, resulting in a
dangerous hidden sinkhole.  Anything with weight sinks knee deep and more,
and only great luck or magic may permit the sand-trapped to escape.  To the
east, there is a mountainous wall of rocky rubble, and thus, impassible. 
However, there is solid ground to the north and south.

  The relentless wind has blown the sand away, leaving a hard packed, rust
colored base.  A rising ridge to the west forms a steep, boulder strewn
wall.  A path, created by the shifting sands, leads north and south.

A Rocky Path
  Boulders form natural walls along a path leading away from the
mountainous ridge to the east and west.  The ground is rust in color,
hard-packed and firm.  It is impossible to tell if anyone has come this way
in years, days or hours.  A gentle breeze, almost seeming to carry a bit of
moisture, wafts from the north.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Task 1  : Find out who caused the castle's disappearance. (Completed)

Discover who was responsible for the disappearance of the ancient wanderer's 
home and return to him with his name.

Task 2  : Find a way to defeat Mage Madigan.

An aged wanderer says, "Is that right? I have heard of this madman and his 
envious hatred of my liege lord. He is a powerful magician, impossible for 
mere mortals to defeat. Perhaps you know how to find him, and devise a way to
defeat him. It's up to you. I am too old and decrepit to do more than eat my 
heart out over this. 

Task 3  : Find the genie and gain his trust. (Completed)

Mad Mage Madigan says, " The genie of the lamp has trapped me here in this
 prison.  Find him and discover what magic words will release me.  You must
 gain his trust to do this. Come back with his wand and help me escape. 
 You need not worry for yourself.  You may leave in the manner by which you
 came.  Come back to me here and tell me the words, and I will reward you
 well."

The genie's voice echoes triumphantly in your head, 'Return to me 
immediately. I am well pleased with you.

Task 4  : Kill 25 of Mage Madigan's evil minions. (Completed)
          Minions left to kill: 0

Task 5  : Do something about Mad Mage Madigan!

The genie of the lamp says, "You have proven your worth many times over. 
You seem to be a trustworthy accomplice." Staring upwards, the genie 
of the lamp chants, "pach nocto unus, a peaceful night, forever, that is the 
wizard's fate."

Unforgiving Heat
  A high rocky outcropping provides a perfect wall blocking the stinging and 
grit of the recent desert sandstorm. Surprisingly, the air now is still, 
almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be
an understatement. A long tall glass of water would be welcome but there is 
none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a 
wish.

  A pool of soft sand has formed between two crests, resulting in a
dangerous hidden sinkhole.  Anything with weight sinks knee deep and more,
and only great luck or magic may permit the sand-trapped to escape.  To the

However, there is solid ground to the north and south.

A Wide Walkway
  This wide hallway is lined with pillars and beautiful urns. Some of the urns 
have been knocked over by the force of the sandstorm that swept through the 
castle, and their shattered remains lay strewn across the floor. A fragrant 
breeze carries through from the south hallway, although the air should be 
still this far underground.

throughout the area, covered in colorful berries that provide nourishment
for the birds that flock around the oasis.  A handful of dwarfed palm trees
grow here, providing much-needed shade as they rustle softly in the desert

A Sandy Path
  Standing at the edge of a lush and fertile oasis, it is hard to
understand how so much life can exist next to the barren wastes of the
desert to the south.  A few boulders and dwarfed bushes form a barrier
against the whipping sands, protecting the grassy ground that feels as soft
as a carpet.  Somewhere in the depths of the oasis, the rhythmic lapping of
water against a shore can be heard underneath the faint sounds of wildlife.

Your body softens.

The Wick of the Lamp
  You are in what seems like a metal tube with a rope hanging from a small 
opening above and dangling into pitch darkness below.  The rope is damp with an
oily substance and as a result, slippery to grasp.  Looking about, you can see 
that the walls are made of tarnished silver, round and smooth.  There is no 
foothold and the only option is to see where the rope leads.

  The floor slants gently downward but is slippery with an oily substance.  A

you attempt to save yourself from slipping.  The rope itself is covered in oil

  You are floating on a pool of oil, much like a bug on water.  The oil is 
fragrantly scented, but almost overpowering in its sickly sweetness.  The 
curved walls of the chamber are made of silver.  You can dive down, under the 
oil, or swim east.  There is something like a tunnel rising out of the oil to 
the west.  A rope hangs down from the tunnel, and drops spiralling into the 
pool of oil.

The Royal Tower
  The tower room is enormous and skillfully constructed. At the center of the 
floor, a beautiful mosaic of still-vibrant colors depicts a lion resting 
under a palm tree. The tower extends to the east and north, where the bottom 
of some spiral stairs can be seen. Wide pillars line the walls here, where 
the royal guards may once have stood to protect the stairs up to the living 
quarters.

  This hallway through the east wing leads east and south. The air is filled 
with a cloud of dust from the sand that trickles down through cracks in the 
vaulted ceiling. A woven rug covers the floor, but has been eaten away in 
parts by insects that have made the castle their home. Doors lead north and

  This spot seems relatively calm, free of the stinging pellets of sand
that is the staple diet of the inhabitants.  It is a little greener than
expected, and a spot of shade near by is inviting.  Already, grass tickles
underfoot.  Is that the sound of flowing water to the east?

  The wind, laden with stinging sand and tiny pebbles, blows relentlessly,
forming tiny whirlwinds that whip at your feet, and brush like sandpaper
across your face.  Putting shoulder to wind helps to protect the eyes, nose
and ears from invading grit.  Eastwards, amongst the boulders and blown
sand, there appears to be a path of sorts.

The Royal Tower
  This section of the tower is wide and bright, lit both with natural light 
filtering down somehow from above, and the glow that fills the air from no 
discernable source. The tower walls are thick and sturdy, made of smooth 
stone that has held up well against both sand and time. Arched openings lead 
in all directions from this level of the tower, while spiral stairs head both
up and down.

[ Exits: north east south west up down ]
A manticore roams the halls seeking evil.

The Tower Room
  Stone and mortar walls surround you.  On each wall, recessed and raised, 
there are ledges and above each ledge, at shoulder height, there is a narrow 
arrowslit window.  The floor of the tower is made of wide wooden planks, a 
wonder to find so far from any living forest.  A spiral staircase leads 
downwards.

On Strange Ground
  Sand has accumulated here in an unnaturally symmetrical pattern, forming
a circular mound.  Climbing the mound with little difficulty, you can see
that the surface seems to be part of a construction of some kind.  Brushing
away the sand further reveals what appears to be an opening of some kind.

An Endless Sea of Sand (G)
  A cliff falls steeply to the north, making that way quite impassible. 
The horizon beyond is a shimmery wave of haze, hills merging in the dust
with the pale distant sky.  A sandy crest leads east and west, and to the
south there is something not quite natural, jutting out of the sand.

Unforgiving Heat
  A high rocky outcropping provides a perfect wall blocking the stinging and 
grit of the recent desert sandstorm. Surprisingly, the air now is still, 
almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be
an understatement. A long tall glass of water would be welcome but there is 
none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a 
wish.

Parched, Poached and Pelted
  Gusts of sand-soaked wind break through the heat, suddenly opposing each 
direction you attempt. Pebbles, swept up by sharp little whirlwinds of sand, 
pelt painfully against your skin. Adding to this, the blistering heat slows 
each step to a crawl.

Parched, Poached and Pelted
  The wind, laden with stinging sand and tiny pebbles, blows relentlessly,
forming tiny whirlwinds that whip at your feet, and brush like sandpaper
across your face.  Putting shoulder to wind helps to protect the eyes, nose
and ears from invading grit.  Eastwards, amongst the boulders and blown
sand, there appears to be a path of sorts.

  This spot seems relatively calm, free of the stinging pellets of sand
that is the staple diet of the inhabitants.  It is a little greener than
expected, and a spot of shade near by is inviting.  Already, grass tickles
underfoot.  Is that the sound of flowing water to the east?

  The wind is noticeably cooler, and lacking in the gritty dust of the
exposed desert near by.  Wild desert flowers, of brilliant gold and deep
purple, have taken advantage of the improved conditions, and without the
hand of sentience, present a brilliant mirage-like cascade of colour.

A Desert Oasis
  The grass grows almost defiantly in this verdant corner of the desert. 
Thoughts of fresh fruit and roasted fowl provide a distraction from the
heat.  Or is it just cooler here, in the shade of the dwarf palms?  The
water lies just out of reach, so close and yet so far.  Could it be a
mirage?  Something about this scene is just too unnatural...

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

[ Exits: north east south west up down ]
(Player) (Invis) (Hidden) (White Aura) (OPK) Forma not formatted.
(Charmed) A large hairy rat waddles by and ...meows at you?  Oh, it's a kitten.
(Player) (Linkdead) Relek of the past!.
(Player) (Translucent) (White Aura) WeaponGuy is dead, trying to retreive his corpse..
(Player) (White Aura) Snagglez Sene sovya caba'donde ain dovienya.

A Stand off Starlight Way (G)
  This is a small stand off of the road.  There is no longer anything for
sale here, just a loose structure that was once a thriving shop.  Now the
occasional bum stops here for a rest out of the weather.  

  The faint sounds of music echo everywhere within this stall.

You find yourself lost in the beat...

The Esplanade (G)
  You have arrived on a small pathway.  Deep from the north, you hear the
sound of soothing music.  The muscles all over your body seem to have a life
of their own, beating with the rhythm of the music.  No doubt, you have come
to the musical realm, Art of Melody.  

[ Exits: north south ]
     (Magic) A bench sits here rooted to the ground.
     (Magic) Endless supplies of fresh water flow out of the musical fountain. Thirsty?
A humongous black key stands on guard by the pathway, but doesn't it belong on a piano?
A black key exclaims 'Ahh.. you've finally arrived!'
A black key exclaims 'Welcome to Art of Melody, KumoGami!'
A black key exclaims 'To continue, proceed north!'

pieces displayed on the wall, all by different artists.  Each one with its
own unique style.  The music matches exactly with the portraits on display. 
The greatest enjoyment is to listen and admire the portraits at the same
time.  You feel that the search for the musician behind the soothing music
is coming to an end.  The One is near.

  This studio seems to be for experimental theatre and dance presentations.
It is a small, intimate space.  The studio has a flexible sound system and
the quality of the music is confirmed.  However, nobody is doing a
performance now.

It seems that a performance has just ended not long ago.  At the end of each

Right before your eyes, you see a giant tablature.  It's rolled up in the
shape of a tube, with little hands and legs plopped out.  It's used as an
ancient form of indicating musical sounds by letters and other signs instead
of by notes.  Strangely, you feel that it doesn't really serve that purpose
here.  You hear the sounds of keys hitting each other within the tablature;
and you could swear it's peering carefully at your hair.  So what does it
actually do?  
A guitar tablature is in perfect health.

the music coming from here.  But still, you haven't given up yet.  Perhaps
somebody around here may give you some advice.

  The displays end here.  You feel relieved as you exit the museum.  You
try to scan around for a sign of anyone playing music, but fail to detect
anyone.  The music becomes softer and softer.  Definitely, it is not around
this area.  You feel depressed knowing that this long search might turn out
to be a vain attempt.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Stone Archway
  This is an ancient stone archway.  Various faces of demons and other grim
pictures are painted onto it.  Stone gargoyles and demons glare down at you
from atop the arch.  There is a bronze plaque above the archway.

Ancient Room
  You are standing in a large stone room.  Feels like a crypt.  Ancient
murals of Hell and punishment cover the walls.  In the middle of the room
are stairs that lead down in to the darkness.  From the stairway you can
smell brimstone and sulfur.  To the west it looks as if there is a shrine.

which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Global quests are similar to campaigns and standard quests.  Everyone in a
global quest is given a list of up to 15 different targets to kill (with
the possibility of multiple instances of a target).  The first player to
kill all the targets wins the rewards.

There are multiple gquest cycles - one that anyone can join, a cycle only 
for people who have won less than or equal to 10 gquests and a cycle for
less than or equal to 200 wins.

If a global quest is completed before 10 minutes have passed and there is
someone else still in the global quest, it will be extended by 5 more 
minutes to give people a chance to get a few extra qp mobs.  Finishing all 
the mobs in the gquest in extended time does not give you the gquest "win" 
rewards - just the qp from the mob kills. If all the remaining people in the 
GQ kill all the targets it will end immediately.

Your main interface with the global quest system is via the 'gquest'
command; see 'help gquest' for more information on how to use this command.

The 'global' channel announces all upcoming gquests, and you will not see
any other information on the channel unless you are participating in the
current gquest.  This channel is not available when a gquest is not running.
When a quest is active, only people in the quest can talk on this channel.

While you are taking part in a global quest, certain skills and spells will
not work, or may not work as you are used to.

You may only win a maximum of three global quests per level. Therefore, 
once you win three global quests at your current level, you simply need to
reach the next level, where you will once again be allowed to win up to 
three global quests. There is also a limit of 100 kills per level at 
which you will stop being rewarded for individual global quest kills.

A set of rules explaining what actions are and are not allowed regarding
Global Quests can be reviewed in 'help gqrules'.  Clans-sponsored global
quests are no longer available.

Many of the game actions (including combat, most autonomous monster 
actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, weather, and area resetting) are based
upon interval timers.  Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer
is popularly called the 'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average around 30 
seconds of real time. This represents about an hour of game time.

Area resetting depends on the area, but for most areas is somewhere between
5 and 10 minutes each reset. Items in the room will repop regardless of 
whether or not a player is in the room.  Players in an area no longer have
an impact on the time an area takes to repop.
