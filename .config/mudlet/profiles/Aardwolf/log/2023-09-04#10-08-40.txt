A path through the forest
  Just over the trees to the north you can see the top of the tower known
as Mistridge.  The road to the north seems to lead directly to it.  The
forests to the east and west are thick and dark.  The tower known as
Mistridge looms over the trees the the north and a small road in that
direction seems to lead directly to it.  The thick forests to the east and
west appear dark and still.

The Forest
  The dense forest appears to stretch for miles in every direction. The forest 
covers a hill, allowing you to scramble to the top of trees to get a good 
vantage point. There does not seem to be an end to the forest. Occasionally, 
you catch the faint sound of voices from above. Have you been in the forest 
too long or were those voices real?

The Forest
  At least the weather is nice for traveling. After wandering through this 
forest for miles it's certainly a relief it's not raining. A faint breeze 
blows through the trees and hides any sounds that don't want to be heard.
There may be a reason this place is so quiet. Perhaps monsters or wild beasts
lurk in the trees.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this 
seemingly endless room are two doors leading to what you believe is some 
kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

Clans are a special thing on aardwolf allowing like minded people to 
come together. Read help clans for more information. Boot Camp is a 
clan designed to help new players learn more about the game and we 
enjoy doing it. Read help boot and help newbieclan to learn more. 
This area is not a part of the Academy and the first thing you should 
do on Aardwolf is complete the Academy goal. We offer newbie starter 
kits to all new players. If you would like one please send a member a 
tell. You can type who boot to see who is online. If they do not 
respond then they are most likely afk. All items in our newbie kits 
are also sold in this shop. Type list if you would like to take a look

Courtyard (G)
  It stinks.  The smell of sweat, tears and broken spirits fills the air.
The sounds of soldiers in training have gotten much louder as you step
into the courtyard. "I don't know but I've been told, it's hard to run
with the weight of gold." You see soldiers everywhere running laps on
a beaten path around the courtyard. Some less-fortunate soldiers are lined
up doing pushups in the mud. In the center of the courtyard lay a finely 
manicured lawn and the Boot clan flag. To the north you notice the bunk 
house, to the west the General's quarters. Suddenly, an officer grabs you 
by the shoulder and shouts "What are you gawking around for, future
soldier? It's time you enlisted!" And with that he points you east to 
the enlisting office.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!
Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

Approaching the Camp of the Gathering Horde
  Going down the hill, you can see the expansive plains of Hathzor spread out 
limitless before you, only broken by the harsh mountains to the north and the
Great Desert to the south-east. Sarcoph's warcamp dominates your view, a 
smoking black sore, a loud and bustling abomination choking the land's 
beauty. Trees logged from the local mountains have been shaved to form a gory
fence circling the encampment, ogre heads impaled intermittently on the 
saplings.

The Mount Field [**> PK <**]
  The warmounts are kept here, ferocious and lethal, entirely feral to all but 
their masters. Earth and the sparse fauna left are covered in ash, victims of
the mighty fire-breathers; a few fires burn here and there. Hoofs and claws 
alike leave the ground churned and cleft. Most of the animals are tethered 
for the safety of all, but the mighty fence surrounding the enclosure ensures
none but the flyers can escape.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Approaching the Camp of the Gathering Horde
  Going down the hill, you can see the expansive plains of Hathzor spread out 
limitless before you, only broken by the harsh mountains to the north and the
Great Desert to the south-east. Sarcoph's warcamp dominates your view, a 
smoking black sore, a loud and bustling abomination choking the land's 
beauty. Trees logged from the local mountains have been shaved to form a gory
fence circling the encampment, ogre heads impaled intermittently on the 
saplings.

prayer that you don't share that end. You wonder what drives the people that 
can do such things, those that can take life and torture without the

Further Into the Encampment
  Further into the camp now, you take a moment to stop and gather in your 
surroundings. Most of the expansive camp's ground is covered with small and 
hastily pitched tents, but every now and then across the view a colossal 
edifice has been erected, dwarfing those not quite as grand. To the south you
can see animal housings and hear the roaring of mighty beats.

  What was once a lush pasture filled with wild grasses now moves in a frenetic
cacophony of sound and motion. The verdant blades lie dead, long-since

At a Tent Unparalleled in Size (G)
  You have finally reached the end of the camp, but instead of relief for the 
end of an unbearably long walk, all you can feel is awe. Awe, because to the 
east lies a tent that is impossibly large. No amount of physical coordination
could equal that required to construct it. From within come the sounds of 
explosions and shouts, and you wonder what is inside.

  If the resonating din outside the tent didn't prepare you for the sheer chaos
inside, that's not surprising. Smoke and steam cloud the air, piercing 
whistles shred your mind with their wails, unidentifiable objects fly through
the air, and fires erupt from the strangest places. The magnitude of this 
tent is absurd, and though you don't know who could have set it up, you know 
you don't want to be under it if it falls.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

The Beach
  A long, narrow strip of beach provides access to the blue waters of Lake
Kirnas.  This is one of the most beloved parts of the Guild base, and few
can resist spending some off-duty hours here.  At night, Guildmembers often
build a bonfire and party hard, and while the sun is shining competition is
fierce but friendly for a good sunbathing spot.  Everybody works to keep the
beach clean, and fallen branches are piled in one small spot, free for
anybody who wants to build a fire or whittle.

leaves a delicious aroma lingering on the air.  The Guildmembers' involved
with pegasi live here with their partners, their green and brown tents
blending in to the surroundings.  A wide but deliciously clear and cold
stream burbles its way eastish, and a few tasteful bridges allow passage
over it.  To the south can be glimpsed a large wooden shelter provided for
truly inclement weather.

The Lea
  The Lea is several acres of lush grassland, expanding over gently rolling
hills.  Several groves of fruit trees break up the horizon, and each breeze
leaves a delicious aroma lingering on the air.  The Guildmembers involved
with pegasi live here with their partners, their green and brown tents
blending in to the surroundings.  A wide but deliciously clear and cold
stream burbles its way eastish, and a few tasteful bridges allow passage
over it.  To the south can be glimpsed a large wooden shelter provided for
truly inclement weather.

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that

Yuna questions 'I have a manor. Does anyone know why what's shown on my mini-maps, both of them,
changes sometimes when I'm in my manor? Sometimes I only see my manor's one room, the porch-room 
right in front of it and then the room connected to it. Sometimes I see the surrounding rooms and 
even some manors (but as unexplored rooms because I've never visited any of them). It seems to be a 
bit random.'

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the

Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

Entrance to Annwn
  The entrance to the islands of Annwn is inviting enough. The road is well 
maintained and easily accessible. This is the land that is described in
the recently found manuscripts in the catacombs of Aylor. The great
minstrel Talisin wrote about these islands in his epic poems. However,
many of the scrolls upon which his poems are written have been severely
damaged. Scholars claim the entrance here leads to the afterlife.
Adventurers have come here to explore in the past, but never has a soul
returned to tell the story of their journey. The road continues to the
east, albeit less maintained. Nevertheless, you can sense no imminent
danger in that direction. It might be worth checking it out.

Docks of Annwn (G)
  These docks look desolate. When you squint your eyes you think you see a few 
ships docked to the south, but you can't be sure. The pavement is poorly 
maintained and, to your horror, you can see all kinds of despicable insects 
scurrying at your feet. The smell of decay fills your nostrils, and a low, 
lingering, putrid brown fog slowly creeps over the docks. Towards the east 
you can make out some sort of building with a sign on it that reads 'Lost 
Souls Inn'. Going back up is probably your best option, but if you must, you 
could try to find out more at the inn.

Lost Souls Inn (G)
  This must be the strangest inn you have ever visited. There are numerous
ethereal beings sitting on chairs at the tables, but they are managing to
leave the layer of dust that is covering everything completely
undisturbed. They are all drinking, and you wonder where the liquid they
consume is ending up. Some of the guests look at you quizzically. At
least, you feel them looking at you, but they have no eyes, just empty
sockets. The ceiling looks about to cave in, and the walls are tainted
with strange brown spots. A place this uninviting and yet so busy must
truly be the last place to have a drink. The only mortal here is behind
the bar. That might be a good person to start interrogating, since there's
nothing else to find here.

Entrance to Annwn
  The entrance to the islands of Annwn is inviting enough. The road is well 
maintained and easily accessible. This is the land that is described in
the recently found manuscripts in the catacombs of Aylor. The great
minstrel Talisin wrote about these islands in his epic poems. However,
many of the scrolls upon which his poems are written have been severely
damaged. Scholars claim the entrance here leads to the afterlife.
Adventurers have come here to explore in the past, but never has a soul
returned to tell the story of their journey. The road continues to the
east, albeit less maintained. Nevertheless, you can sense no imminent
danger in that direction. It might be worth checking it out.

thick roots of what must have been impressive trees. The steps are
slippery with wet moss and you feel dead branches streak across your face
as you try to find the way down. Mysteriously it's eerie quiet. You can
still feel the moisture on the walls, but that trickle of water that you
heard before is now gone. You wonder if you took a wrong a turn somewhere.

  And with a loud splash you plunge into the freezing water. The water is so 
cold that your limbs instantly stiffen. It's too deep to stand, so your only 
option is to swim west and hope for the best! Alternatively you can bravely 
turn away and head back up those stairs again, but you already know they lead
nowhere. You've come this far, and there's an upside - you can see a faint 
light to the west.

Entrance to Annwn
  The entrance to the islands of Annwn is inviting enough. The road is well 
maintained and easily accessible. This is the land that is described in
the recently found manuscripts in the catacombs of Aylor. The great
minstrel Talisin wrote about these islands in his epic poems. However,
many of the scrolls upon which his poems are written have been severely
damaged. Scholars claim the entrance here leads to the afterlife.
Adventurers have come here to explore in the past, but never has a soul
returned to tell the story of their journey. The road continues to the
east, albeit less maintained. Nevertheless, you can sense no imminent
danger in that direction. It might be worth checking it out.

Gates of Annwn (1314)

Docks of Annwn (G)
  These docks look desolate. When you squint your eyes you think you see a few 
ships docked to the south, but you can't be sure. The pavement is poorly 
maintained and, to your horror, you can see all kinds of despicable insects 
scurrying at your feet. The smell of decay fills your nostrils, and a low, 
lingering, putrid brown fog slowly creeps over the docks. Towards the east 
you can make out some sort of building with a sign on it that reads 'Lost 
Souls Inn'. Going back up is probably your best option, but if you must, you 
could try to find out more at the inn.

Lost Souls Inn (G)
  This must be the strangest inn you have ever visited. There are numerous
ethereal beings sitting on chairs at the tables, but they are managing to
leave the layer of dust that is covering everything completely
undisturbed. They are all drinking, and you wonder where the liquid they
consume is ending up. Some of the guests look at you quizzically. At
least, you feel them looking at you, but they have no eyes, just empty
sockets. The ceiling looks about to cave in, and the walls are tainted
with strange brown spots. A place this uninviting and yet so busy must
truly be the last place to have a drink. The only mortal here is behind
the bar. That might be a good person to start interrogating, since there's
nothing else to find here.

Ship Docking Area
  The docking area is not what you expected. It is merely a ruined wooden
pier with a lot of missing planks. The remaining planks seem already
rotten to the core. You want to negotiate these docks carefully, since the
water below them is anything but clear. In fact, it seems rather rancid.
The four ships moored here are not very well maintained. Maybe stepping
into one would sink it instantly. To the west you spot an escape back to
the gates. The alternative is entering one of these ships. Will you choose
safety over adventure?

spoken words that sound like 'Bum yscwyt yg kat' and 'Buant hwyr yr

you want to hug a tree. A broken stump however is all the tree you can

option is to swim west and hope for the best! Alternatively you can bravely 
turn away and head back up those stairs again, but you already know they lead
nowhere. You've come this far, and there's an upside - you can see a faint 
light to the west.

A narrow passage
  The water is freezing still, but you can see sunlight from above. The
walls of this flooded cave room are far too slippery to climb though. When
you squint your eyes you can see some moss-covered path leading upward. In
contrast to the eastern entrance of this underground lake, the western
side has no steps and is strangely dense with vegetation that reaches its
uppermost parts longingly towards the dim light above.

A narrow passage
  It really is a narrow passage, between some large rocks and big trees.
These trees don't look dead, merely sleeping. They have dark brown leaves,
but not many. From up above there's ample light, and you spot several
small streams of water pouring along the walls of this passage, making
their way down and feeding the lake below with fresh water. The extended
roots of the trees force you to hop along the passage, but it is slippery.
One misstep and you'll end up in the cold water water below.

the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger

around you in what appear to be fingers clawing at your person.  You realize
something powerful and evil lives here.  The tower is by far the tallest
thing you have ever seen, and as you approach you notice that it isn't
resting on the bloodstained earth, but rather hovering above it.  What kind

quite as tidy as their brothers.  There is a small mess over in the corner,
which appears to be rags used to polish their weapons.  Despite the pile of
rags, the guards' armor and weapons still look like they have not seen a
good cleaning in years.  At the far end of the room there is a table with
the remains of their last meal, and a deck of cards.  From the look of these
guards and their brothers in the other room, their master is more than
generous in his treatment of his henchmen.

Guard Room
  As you enter this guardroom, you notice the guards on this side are not
quite as tidy as their brothers.  There is a small mess over in the corner,
which appears to be rags used to polish their weapons.  Despite the pile of
rags, the guards' armor and weapons still look like they have not seen a
good cleaning in years.  At the far end of the room there is a table with
the remains of their last meal, and a deck of cards.  From the look of these
guards and their brothers in the other room, their master is more than
generous in his treatment of his henchmen.

Guard Room
  Upon entering this room your attention is immediately drawn to the rows
and rows of fine weapons and armor.  It is obvious that the guards here are
equipped to handle any situation.  The guards themselves look you over with
a keen eye, their hands resting at the small of their back in perfect
attention.  When you realize that these guys have the knowledge and skill to
use the finely crafted weapons and armor you were admiring only moments ago,
you decide it would be wise not to test these theories....

Approaching the Dread Tower
  As you exit the forest and begin approaching the tower, the shadows move
around you in what appear to be fingers clawing at your person.  You realize
something powerful and evil lives here.  The tower is by far the tallest
thing you have ever seen, and as you approach you notice that it isn't
resting on the bloodstained earth, but rather hovering above it.  What kind
of being could have such power to do this?

  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.

help colors
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Colors Colours Ansi.
Help Category : Features.
Related Helps : Colorset, Rawcolors, Xterm.
Last Updated  : 2021-12-19 11:02:34.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:  color        - toggles current setting.
         color on/off - explicitly set color to on or off.

The 'color' command turns on/off MUD output coloring.  'ansi' is an alias
for 'color'.

The ANSI standard allows for 15 common colors that appear everywhere in
Aardwolf.  They are divided into normal and bright colors.

   @b / @B blue / bblue           @c / @C cyan / bcyan
   @r / @R red / bred             @m / @M magenta / bmagenta
   @g / @G green / bgreen         @w / @W white / bwhite
   @y / @Y yellow / byellow            @D gray (bright black)

Grey/bright black is not visible on all connections; use the 'seegray'
toggle to enable/disable seeing bright black.  There is no 'dark black'.

To use color codes in your title, communication, or whatever else you
write, prefix the color with '@' followed by the letter code.

For example, '@WColor @Gis @mCool.@w' will look like
              Color is Cool.               

It may help to END A SEGMENT OF COLORED TEXT WITH @w.  This changes 
the color of the text to low white.

To display an @ symbol, use @@.  @- may be used to display a tilde, though
the MUD no longer processes them and thus the standard tilde may be used.

Aardwolf allows you to customize your own independent color scheme for most
types of MUD output.  Type 'help colorset' to read about this feature.  The
syntax 'colorset colors' will display all 15 colors and their color codes
similar to the list above.

Aardwolf also supports xterm 256 color mode- see 'help xterm' for more
information.

Channels (discluding tells and echos) may have their color scheme returned 
to the channel's default color for all users after a color change has been 
displayed. To do this, simply use $C at the point where you would like to 
resume the channel's regular color. Note that it is difficult to actually 
display $C itself on a channel, e.g., for MUSHclient or CMUD a user can 
type $@ C. Also note that $C does not work in the note editor.

help xterm

Help Keywords : Xterm.
Help Category : Information.
Related Helps : Color, Colorset.
Last Updated  : 2011-04-15 16:27:22.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax     : xterm              - Turn 256 color mode on/off.
             color 256          - See a table of the colors.
             color raw256       - See table of colors with no mud parsing.

Aardwolf now supports Xterm 256 color mode. Whether or not you can see 
Xterm 256 color depends on your client. See the bottom of this helpfile 
for a brief list of clients known to work with 256 colors.

Every xterm color has a corresponding "closest match" in ANSI so that
players without xterm support are not affected.

To use xterm colors use @x[color] where [color] is any number 0 - 255. 
The first 16 colors corresponding to their ANSI equivalents and colors 232 
to 255 are varying levels of gray. An online chart of all 256 colors can
be found at:

 http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Xterm_color_chart.png

It is possible to use either @x020 or @x20 but the 3 character version 
is recommended to avoid conflicts with color codes followed by numbers 
that are part of the actual message.

All codes from 0 to 255 can be used with @x but some colors considered 
too dark to display on the average screen will be automatically 
brightened. To see this, compare 'color 256' to 'color raw256' noting 
the difference (for example) in colors 0, 52, 53 and 232. 


Clients:
--------

Clients known to work with 256 color include Mushclient, Mudlet, CMud 3.x, 
Tintin++, Tinyfugue, Atlantis and the Blowtorch Android clients. Note that
Zmud does not work with Xterm 256 colors. To see if you have 256 color
support, type 'xterm', if you see Orange then you have it. 


Known Issues:
-------------

- Kind of obscure, but if you have GMCP rawcolor mode on but do NOT have
  xterm, the GMCP data is still going to show @x123. There is an overhead
  involved in fixing this that may make it not worth it. If you're using
  rawcolors via GMCP then you have a means to process color locally even
  if you can't actually display 256 colors.

- Whoname cannot currently use 256 color mode.

- You can use these colors in strings in the editor (object names etc)
  but not in editor fields specifically requiring a color name such as
  the default map color for an area or in sector editing.

can give permission.  Upgrades stating 'My leader wants me to request these
upgrades' or 'Please change [this] in my spouse's manor' will not be
accepted.

Please include all necessary information for each upgrade.  This includes
room key (clan-# or manor(etc)-#, not UID), mob or object keys as needed,
and all strings (see 'help strings') for each request.  Remember to include
shopkeeper mob keys as well for clan item upgrade requests.

Also include the help file and item number where the upgrade is listed,
along with costs and any tier discount (if applicable).  To find the
correct help file for your upgrade, use the following prefixes:
help cdef- lists clan defense upgrade categories
help ch- lists closed hall upgrade categories
help eq- lists clan equipment upgrade categories
help cm- lists clan management categories
help mu- lists manor upgrade categories

These steps will help the Imms complete the upgrade quickly and make sure
it is exactly what you desire.  Thanks for the cooperation!


An example note:


Please add a new room up from my current manor room (manor3-9999).  The
name of the room should be @GUp the Oak Tree@w.  I will add a description
later.  I am eligible for T1 discount.

In this new room, add a level 30 healer:
Name: manor healer hello nurse
Sex: female
Short: a nurse
Long: This nurse is more than happy to tend your wounds.
Desc:
Dressed in the typical white outfit, this nurse is certainly ready to tend
to your needs.

Add a story to this healer: 
Time to take your temperature!  ...Oh!  Not that way!

Finally, add an exit north from this room to Aylor.

Total cost should be

MU-ROOMS 1.  Create a new room                 10tp
MU-MOBS  3.  Personal healer                3M      150
MU-MOBS  8.  Add/change a mob story       500k       25
MU-EXITS 1.  One-way exit to area           5M      250

Total is 8.5M/10tp/425qp, or 7.65M gp, 9tp, and 383qp after discount.

Magical items currently include potions and/or scrolls. Pass door scrolls
are not allowed. Level of items other than refresh may go no higher than 
201.

Upgrading an item already in existence will not require a player to 
purchase the new item. i.e., upgrading a potion from level 40 to 80 will
only require that the player pay for 40 more levels.

* Up to 4 instances can be added.  Per level cost is for total levels-
i.e., a 2x level 20 lotus costs 40 levels.
 
** IMPORTANT: Items left inside of a manor container will NOT save
through reboots/crashes.  The container cannot be picked up from the
manor floor.

*** Maximum heal/mana rate on manor beds is 200%.

**** To change a fountain, the manor owner must first purchase option 12,
custom fountain.  This includes descriptions and a free liquid type from
'help eq-liquids'.  Once purchased, options 13 or 14 may be purchased to
set either a different stock liquid or a custom liquid (see 'help liquids')
on the fountain.
 
***** Cost is per flag (glow+hum = 500k gold/50 qp).  No invis flags.
 
****** Objects in rooms always show in room before mobiles.  Only one reset
per object is allowed; additional copies are the cost as if the object was 
new and count as another vnum towards manor limits.  Only one campfire and
stock fountain are available per manor. This reset cost also needs to be
applied when reorganizing a shop list.

******* Customizable campfires do not count towards the 8 object limit for
manor objects.
 
(1) An object can be reset in the manor only once. Thus, an object resetting 
on the shopkeeper can not be reset inside the manor. This upgrade cost is
required for any item being reset on a shopkeeper. Default location for new 
items is your manor floor. The cost of resetting an item on a shopkeeper 
does not include reorganizing the order of the shop list, that cost is 
covered under #19 of this help file.

*** Please note that all upgrades need to be submitted to the Imms on
the upgrades board.

With the introduction of V3, Aardwolf no longer has a set list of liquids.
Instead, any liquid may have a custom string for the name (cream soda, tap
water, soy milk, concentrated yak spit- nearly any string, subject to Imm
approval) and hunger/thirst/proof values are set individually, from 0 to
100.

Purchasing a custom liquid includes choosing settings for liquid name as
well as hunger, thirst, and proof (drunkenness), from 0 to 100.  For this
reason, there is an additional cost to manor owners and clans to use this
upgrade.  See 'help mu-objects' and 'help eq-fountains'/'help
eq-drinkcontainers' for pricing.  Include the liquid name and hunger,
thirst, and proof values when requesting a custom liquid type.

You may also form cocktails by mixing multiple liquids together in a
container- see 'help fill' for details.

  Oh no it looks like the perils of Aardwolf have overcome you and you have 
fallen in battle. No worries though it looks like your fellow soldiers were 
able to recover your body and resurrect your spirit. It's a strange feeling 
seeing your body on the ground. IMPORTANT: Make sure you loot everything 
off your corpse and it decomposes before you leave the room! Sometimes
you might have issues seeing the invisible objects on your corpse. You can 
buy a detect invisibility potion from our shop run s3e from here and type 
list. Also don't be afraid to ask for a miracle on clantalk. If it works 
it could help restore some of your lost experience. The Medical Lounge is 
south from here in case you need a healer.

  You stand in a plain looking room, with bunk beds lining both sides. Green 
wool blankets line the beds with perfect hospital corners. At the end of this

kind of latrine and shower area. On one wall there is a milk cooler next to a 
sign that shows a Drill Sergeant pointing to the room. Words are written 
over his head, "Milk makes for a strong soldier!". There is a Second

Though a class will generally not duplicate its own spell effect, there are
a number of abilities with similar effects that exist in different classes.

The following spells have very similar (and mutually exclusive) effects:

Spell                    Alternative
Fly                      Levitation
Haste                    Accelerate
Hide                     Chameleon Power, Pass Without Trace
Pass Door                Ectoplasmic Form
Sanctuary                Biofeedback
Sneak                    Pass Without Trace, Shadow Form
Ventriloquate            Create sound


The following skills/spells have similar effects, but are generally more
distinct than the differences in the spells listed above:

Cell Adjustment          Cure Poison/Remove Curse
Disintegrate             Assassinate, Banishment, Slit
Enchant Armor            Reinforce
Enchant Weapon           Sharpen
Gate                     Doorway
Heighten Senses          Detect Hidden/Invis, Night Vision
Herbal Remedy            Cleanse, Cure Blindness/Disease/Poison
Identify                 Lore, Object Read
Negation                 Cancellation
Pick Lock                Bashdoor, Knock
Probability Travel       Teleport
Protection Evil          Inertial Barrier
True Seeing              Detect Good/Evil/Hidden/Invis/Magic
Unlawful Entry           Transport Via Plants
Wolf Spirits             Detect Evil/Hidden/Invis/Magic

Boot Camp Headquarters (G)
  As you enter the Boot Camp Headquarters, you immediately notice that
the large main hall is adorned with feasting tables and fire pits
allowing the green recruits to relax after a hard days training.
A large mural on the northern wall depicts the founding members of the
Boot Camp standing before The Fallen Soldier on an ancient battlefield.
The other stone walls are decorated in the green and yellow insignia of
Boot Camp and various 'Boot Needs You' posters depicting an alluring Diva
dressed in the Boot Camp colours pointing at you.
From the arches leading out of the hall drift sounds of young recruits
being put through their paces and the smells of gunpowder and mud linger
in the air.
