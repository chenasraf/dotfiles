help socials
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Socials.
Help Category : Communication.
Related Helps : Emote, New Social, Rsocial, Shelp.
Last Updated  : 2020-03-25 19:59:29.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:

    socials                  : Displays all socials.
    socials <string>         : Displays socials with given string.
    random                   : Uses a random social.


Summary:

Type 'socials' to get a list. 
Type a social name to use it. 
Type 'social [target]' to use a social on someone else.
Type 'gossip *smile' to use the smile social on the gossip channel.

Detail:

Socials are a pre-set list of various actions that may either have no 
target (*nod = "You nod.") or target yourself or another player/monster
(*nod ivar  = "You nod at Ivar."). 

To see a complete list of socials, type 'socials'.  To search the socials
file for a specific word, use 'socials <word>'.  To see the specific
actions a specific social will do, use 'shelp <social>' (see 'help shelp').

You may also use 'random' instead of a specific social to use a random
social from the list.

For information on how to use socials on channels, see 'help channels'.

If a game command and a social overlap (e.g., 'poker' command vs. 'poke'
social), prefix the social with a * (like '*poke ivar').

Note: Curse-only socials (see 'help nocurse') will only work on channels;
they do not work in rooms.

The 'strictsocials' command sets your character so that you have to use the
'*' prefix to social someone. This is to help reduce the number of socials 
caused by typos. The current 'strictsocials' setting can be seen by typing 
'config all'.

Syntax: rsocial

This command toggles whether or not you allow people to use socials on you,
as well as you using socials on a target, from a distance. Remote socials
are prefixed with a cyan asterisk (*).

help emote
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Keywords : Emote.
Help Category : Communication.
Related Helps : Shelp, Socials, Smote.
Last Updated  : 2017-08-08 22:51:34.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax: emote <action>
 
Emote is used to express emotions or actions. It places your name at the
beginning of a self-created action, based upon what you type in after the
emote.

For example, 'emote has updated all of the help files on Aardwolf' will 
show to the room as 'Lasher has updated all of the help files on Aardwolf'.

Emotes are limited to the room you are in, and will substitute your name 
for the word 'Emote' when it is displayed to others. Emote is useful for 
doing things not covered by the more conventional socials.  To create an
emote with your name somewhere other than the beginning of the emote, use
'smote' (see 'help smote').

Emotes may also be used on channels.  Use the colon (:) symbol to do 
this.  For example, 'gossip :has once again updated all of the help files
on Aardwolf.' would be seen as (Gossip) Lasher has once again updated
all of the help files on Aardwolf.

There are also many 'built-in' social commands, a list of which can be 
obtained by typing 'socials'.  These socials may override in-game commands 
by adding a * to the front- for example, typing 'nod' will toggle 
nodelivery, but typing '*nod' will show the nod social. To use a social
on a channel, it is necessary to use the * ('help socials').

Proper use of emotes, socials and smotes can transform a character from 
ordinary to distinctly... quirky.
