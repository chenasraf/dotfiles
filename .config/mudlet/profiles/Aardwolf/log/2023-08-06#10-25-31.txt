In a Sacred Glade (G)
  You are beneath a huge, ancient, oak tree.  Velvety grass covers the 
ground, sprinkled with violets, buttercups, daisies and anemonies.  The 
glade is very quiet and fairly hums with power.  A large bonfire is in 
the east.  To the west is a small pool of crystal blue water, reflecting 
the trees around it.  To the north there is an altar, made of shimmering 
white stone.  Chisled along the front of the altar are many sacred 
symbols, including the /|\.  To the south is a sacred Rowan tree, its 
creamy white blossoms releasing a subtle, sweet perfume.  The privacy of 
the glade is protected by a hedge of mixed hawthorne and holly.

Mound (G)
  As you wend your way past hedges and trees to approach the bonfire, you
find yourself atop a mound.  The mound is barren of trees but is rather
encircled by stones of various sizes, shapes and positions.  You wonder
about the relationship of the stones to sun and moons and stars of the realm
throughout the seasons.  Some of the stones seem to be sculpted and others
appear more natural in shape.  None seem to be naturally placed, however. 
The ground is thinly covered in grass, apparently worn from much traffic. 
The visible earth through the thinning grass nearly seems to glow.  As you
look around you sense the immense power of this location as the stones seem
to intensify and focus the earthï¿½energy as a magnifying glass might do to
light.  The area would lend itself to a sense of vigor and well-being
mingled perhaps with a tinge of fear of the power harnessed here.

  Standing tall upon a ridge of lush green grass, the skeletal remains of a 
fortress looks on over everything around it. Covering two square miles, five 
concentric, fortified circles can be found throughout the extravagant site.
One of these is known as Reilig na Righ, or Cemetery of the Kings, upon which
a seven foot burial marker stands. Though the structure is slowly decaying 
and being taken over by the steady pressure of nature, the former strength 
shines through in its persistence. Golden-green light filters through the 
walls where even the wind carefully holds its breath in respect.

On occasion, the immaterial may come under threat, or destabilize,
requiring outside intervention in order to keep Andolor's metaphysics
in check.  It is rumored that when a shambling horror, carrying a
large glowing egg in its belly is spotted: that it is an omen of
terrible times to come.  It is thus also known that when such an
event occurs, it is a call to battle for all those in the realm.
Small or large, strong or not, all efforts matter.

Fractals of the Weave is accessed every few days via an automatic
respawn of an mob 3 south of Aylor recall, and immortals can spawn
the event on special occasions.  3 South, 1 down of Aylor recall
is a special room where the 'sense life' spell can be cast to
determine when the event will spawn again.

The event is open to all players, from level 1 through to 201.
Anyone can participate, and no matter your level, you need not
fear gruesome death if you pay a little bit of attention.

Level Range           : 1 to 201
Event Recommended At  : 1 to 201

  You are beneath a huge, ancient, oak tree.  Velvety grass covers the 
ground, sprinkled with violets, buttercups, daisies and anemonies.  The 
glade is very quiet and fairly hums with power.  A large bonfire is in 
the east.  To the west is a small pool of crystal blue water, reflecting 
the trees around it.  To the north there is an altar, made of shimmering 
white stone.  Chisled along the front of the altar are many sacred 
symbols, including the /|\.  To the south is a sacred Rowan tree, its 
creamy white blossoms releasing a subtle, sweet perfume.  The privacy of 
the glade is protected by a hedge of mixed hawthorne and holly.

  In the large, thick branches of the lone tree of Aylor, you see a number
of nests both large and small.  You notice from this vantage point that the
leaves of the tree are covered in a thick, purple dust.  On closer
inspection, you get a whiff of the dust in your nose, and, besides the
tickle, you feel yourself overcome with a warm, fuzzy feeling.  You smile to
yourself and glance around, making sure nobody is looking to harm the tree.

A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

The Grand Plaza (G)
  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

  Standing knee-deep in the murkish water, you feel the curious sensation
of unseen creatures slithering against you.  The soft ripples trailing
across the water are rythmically entrancing, but you blink back to reality
when you see the reptilian creature which forms the ripples.  With a shiver,
you move on, wanting to be out of the mist-laden swamp.

In a Misty Swamp
  The air is heavy with a thick oppressiveness that permeates through the swamp.
Moss hangs heavy from the canopy of trees which block any light, leaving the
swamp in a constant atmosphere of dreary, depressing darkness.  A thick layer
of mist shrouds the waters and dank moss-coated lands.  Your skin feels clammy,
and the trickles of moisture sliding down your face feel eerily alive.  The
constant buzzing of blood-seeking mosquitoes do nothing to drown out the other
sounds of the swamp...  The sounds of life...  and death.

Before the Grand Gates of Castle Vlad-Shamir (G)
  Before you, rising up out of the swamp, is a forbidding edifice.  Huge,
imposing walls, hewn from the very bones of the earth, tower into the sky
above you, reminding you of the puny, insignificant mortal that you are. 
Cold, black marble absorbs all light into it's inky blackness, as if night
itself were contained within these unhallowed walls.  Above the cold,
uncaring marble, towers stretch up, still further, scraping and mocking the
heavens.  Roofed in blood red slate, they stand like an accusatory finger,
challenging the Gods themselves.  Set into these impossibly immutable walls,
a double set of gates, cast from a red metal from deep within the earth bear
down on you with their presence.  Intricate scrollwork, alien yet perfect
craftsmanship, crawls spider-like along the metal, forming wards and runes
of power.  As you stand here, it is as if the place itself reaches out, and
begins to tear at your soul, for surely the demons within will consume it
all...  For a second, you consider stepping back, to face the perils of the
swamp.  Well, this is your choice, mortal, dare you go forward, to face the
corruption within?.....

Inside the Main Courtyard of the Castle
  The courtyard continues further into the castle.  The flagstones
themselves are quarried from a black stone, polished by the passing of time
and booted feet into an inky sheen.  All around the courtyard, demons roam,
going about their business, talking in their guttural rasping tongue.  All
manner of dread abomination walks, slithers and crawls; their forms a
corruption of many different creatures, twisted together into a mocking
semblance of their former lives.  All around the edges of the courtyard,
large archways vault upwards, calling you into their maw.  

[ Exits: north (east) south west ]
(Red Aura) A mortal traitor is here selling secrets to the demon hordes.

  Raucous laughter, the clanking of utensils, the sounds of grunting,
chewing, spitting men at table fills the room.  The tables are rough-hewn,
covered by dirty and stained tablecovers.  Half of the chairs are
overturned, and piles of filthy plates and utensils are scattered throughout
the room on the tables and the floor as well.  The floor has a greasy
appearance, and you step carefully to avoid half-eaten bits of food cast
about on the floor.

  The black stone crenelations of the castle wall jut out like fangs from
a toothy jaw, half obscured and made more demonic by the dark mist that
floats all around the castle sounding into the darkening mists, half
obscuring the rustles, screams, and weak groans that come from the fortress
around you.  Clearly you tread where mortal ones were never meant to walk,
for fear of losing far more than their lives.  The ramparts continue to your

Standing in the Bone Yard
  The floor here is that of pock marked, finger-scratched earth.  Standing,
like macabre sentinels within the dark soil, bones have been bound together
into some kind of demonic icon.  The air is fetid with the smell of death,
your skin crawls at being here...  As you look one way, the rictus grin of a
skull greets your gaze, towards another direction, creepers and other growth
twines around a rib cage...  Perhaps you should leave, before you are
consumed by the bone-yard?

  Corruption abounds.  All around you, strange, alien plant life grows from
the bones that litter this place, as if feeding on them.  Weird monuments
have been constructed and shaped from the pecked-clean limbs of the fallen..
Cracked and ancient tombstones, weathered by the years, cap open graves,

Standing in the Bone Yard
  The floor here is that of pock marked, finger-scratched earth.  Standing,
like macabre sentinels within the dark soil, bones have been bound together
into some kind of demonic icon.  The air is fetid with the smell of death,
your skin crawls at being here...  As you look one way, the rictus grin of a
skull greets your gaze, towards another direction, creepers and other growth
twines around a rib cage...  Perhaps you should leave, before you are
consumed by the bone-yard?

  You stand on stained onyx flagstone, grooved and cut with the marks of

dim shapes with vaguely human forms walking and chuckling at the occasional
screaming echoing out of the mist, or the black tower that rises far to your

On top of a Guard Tower
  The view from the top of this guard tower offers an unrivalled vision of
the scene below.  For a second, your breath catches in your throat, as you
realise the sheer numbers of demons that crawl upon the flagstones, like
ants below you.  To think that this Valkur must be raising an army is no
idle speculation now.  And judging by the way that you have seen them train,
wherever their sights are set should be very afraid...  In your heart, you
utter a silent prayer of warding to your friends and loved ones, hoping that
it might have an affect.

  The crenellations give way, to a drop of a hundred feet, to the
flagstones far below.  From here, the view of the castle is magnificent, and
so forboding...  Strange, Gothic architecture is the flavour of the day,
high arches, combined with slim and cruel minnarets, the pennants of the
demonlord, Valkur, flying high..  If half of the things that you have heard
about him are true, he must be a powerful foe indeed.  Grasping your weapon
strong in hand, you pray that you are strong enough to defeat him.

  You stand on stained onyx flagstone, grooved and cut with the marks of
unearthly clawed feet.  Around you tall stone walls act as both a defense
and a prison, holding safe those souls caught and trapped here for all
eternity.  You dimly see, high above you on a rampart encircling the walls,
dim shapes with vaguely human forms walking and chuckling at the occasional
screaming echoing out of the mist, or the black tower that rises far to your
north.  Scaled forms walk around the courtyard as well, forcing you to press
back into a rough wooden post and pray to your deity not to be seen.  South
of you stand the great gates, and the courtyard opens up in all other
directions from here.

  The courtyard continues further into the castle.  The flagstones
themselves are quarried from a black stone, polished by the passing of time
and booted feet into an inky sheen.  All around the courtyard, demons roam,
going about their business, talking in their guttural rasping tongue.  All
manner of dread abomination walks, slithers and crawls; their forms a
corruption of many different creatures, twisted together into a mocking
semblance of their former lives.  All around the edges of the courtyard,
large archways vault upwards, calling you into their maw.

tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving

marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

Deadman's Alley
  This small alley was named for the people heading to fight in the arena.
Nicknamed by the citizens, this alley was renamed to Deadman's Alley. The 
alley is well lit by lanterns hanging on the walls which contain a candle 
which burns day and night in honor of the gladiators.

of the crowd echoes down to you as gladiators face off against each other.
Huge iron gates stand open allowing everyone to join in combat. However once 
you enter, you had best be ready for a fight. The only way out of the arena 
is in a bag or battling out on your own two feet.

  The arena appears to be split into different types of environments. You are 
standing on the sands of the arena. The sand moves and twists beneath you 
making moving quickly difficult. However it will provide for a soft landing 
if you fall. Crowds from the stands above you cheer and jeer you. You feel 
safe here, but are you truly?

  Standing before the arena, it is a huge building with an open roof. The roar 
of the crowd echoes down to you as gladiators face off against each other.
Huge iron gates stand open allowing everyone to join in combat. However once 
you enter, you had best be ready for a fight. The only way out of the arena 
is in a bag or battling out on your own two feet.

At the Window
  This is the front of the bridge of the storm ship, Tempest. You see a 
desk with many buttons. Better not touch them! Outside, you see another storm
ship which you have seen before perhaps. But where and when? It would take a 
closer look to tell what the ship is, and whether it is friend or foe.

  There are some storm ships in which it is very dark, or where you can see 
white clouds appearing everywhere. The Tempest is surely not one of them.
Every room is brightly lit, the floors swabbed and the brass railings buffed.
Everything is so fine and tidy, it is hard to believe it's a ship that 
traverses the ocean on a storm's leading edge.

The Aylorian Temple of Ivar (G)
  As you enter the white walls of the enormous Aylorian Church, the hollow
tones of an organ fill your ears with a slow, mystifying melody that
instantly calms your senses.  The smell of incense fills the church, giving
some warmth to the coldness of the black marble pews against the white
marble floors.  The windows, traditional stained glass, portray scenes of
mortals on their knees or dying by the blade of a single man.

South leads out of the church, while north takes you farther inside.

Bard Clan Hall (G)
  You have entered a tall stone hall, with a well worn marble floor.
Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,
dressed in bright and colourful cloaks that reflect the sunlight streaming
in from the slit windows cut deeply into the high walls.  To your south is
a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase
can be seen rising to the second floor. Through the opening to the north one
may catch glimpses of a bubbling orange juice fountain and a plush, magenta
bench.  There is a wooden ladder in one corner, leading to an upstairs room.

  This central location in the tower is brightly lit, though you do not
see any light source. A spiral staircase makes its way up to the landing,
before continuing up and out of your sight. There is heavy traffic through
the halls, much of it going to the shops on the next floor. Shadows flicker
lively on the eastern doorway. You notice a door marked 'Backstage' to the
south.

  You look in wonder at the many bright colors in this room.  Even for
Bards there are many.  You see a large man serving customers ahead of you in
the line, each of whom walk away sniffing some unusual and obviously foreign
delicacy.  The only delicacy you can even guess at seems to be a little
carton full of what looks like cheese.  Moving ahead, you can see more of
the back of the stand, in which lies two barrels, which are constantly
making noise which can even be heard over the chatter of the customers.  You
look into the cup of a passing, just-served customer and see that the liquid
is cherry-colored.  The liquid is bubbly and noisy.  In a far corner of the
stand, you see some rocks hopping up and down all by themselves!  In the
other far corner, you see a metal vat, the contents of which are out of your
sight, but you guess is the same as that which lies about it, a
yellow-orange pudding!  As the customer in front of you moves away, you
realize you are next.

The Cloak Room (G)
  At the center of this cloak room is a large, circular coat rack, which is
filled with all manner of outerwear.  Fine fur coats and tailored jackets
hang side by side with travel-stained cloaks and scuffed, crudely tanned
leather overcoats.  Through a gap in the cloaks you see a light flickering.
A closer look reveals a small fire surrounded by a pair of comfortable-
looking benches.  At the foot of a velvet-topped bench is a small fountain,
which bubbles forth fresh orange juice.  Along the walls of the room lie
a multitude of packs, both bulging and empty, some of which lie in the way
of the exits to the northward concession stand and the stairwell to the
west.  However, there are no packs along the southern wall, which is hung
with large, velvet drapes that discreetly cloak another exit to a small
chamber.

Peto's Cornucopia O' Corn (G)
  You look in wonder at the many bright colors in this room.  Even for
Bards there are many.  You see a large man serving customers ahead of you in
the line, each of whom walk away sniffing some unusual and obviously foreign
delicacy.  The only delicacy you can even guess at seems to be a little
carton full of what looks like cheese.  Moving ahead, you can see more of
the back of the stand, in which lies two barrels, which are constantly
making noise which can even be heard over the chatter of the customers.  You
look into the cup of a passing, just-served customer and see that the liquid
is cherry-colored.  The liquid is bubbly and noisy.  In a far corner of the
stand, you see some rocks hopping up and down all by themselves!  In the
other far corner, you see a metal vat, the contents of which are out of your
sight, but you guess is the same as that which lies about it, a
yellow-orange pudding!  As the customer in front of you moves away, you
realize you are next.

  At the center of this cloak room is a large, circular coat rack, which is
filled with all manner of outerwear.  Fine fur coats and tailored jackets
hang side by side with travel-stained cloaks and scuffed, crudely tanned
leather overcoats.  Through a gap in the cloaks you see a light flickering.
A closer look reveals a small fire surrounded by a pair of comfortable-
looking benches.  At the foot of a velvet-topped bench is a small fountain,
which bubbles forth fresh orange juice.  Along the walls of the room lie
a multitude of packs, both bulging and empty, some of which lie in the way
of the exits to the northward concession stand and the stairwell to the
west.  However, there are no packs along the southern wall, which is hung
with large, velvet drapes that discreetly cloak another exit to a small
chamber.

Stylized instruments are carved into the walls, and stone cherubs float on
marble columns bearing gilded harps.  An amazing variety of figures rush by,

a door through which soft music can be heard. To the west, a tall staircase

greens assault your eyes, mixed with yellows, blues, and almost evey other

are the costumes.  Rack upon rack of them stand here, filled with clothing
and props from all walks of life the fevered imaginings of some demented
tailor.  A skilled Bard could become any person he chose whithin minutes in
this wonderous room.  A caveman, a warrior, a vagabond, a cow!  The large

The Sick Bay
  The 'hospital' smell, which you noticed in the hallway, is quite strong
here.  Many beds are situated in a row and made up with snow white sheets. 
The shelves on the walls are full of medical supplies.  You take one of them
and try to use it.  But as you can't find out how, you put it back on its
place.

The Storm Cruiser, Tempest
  Yes indeed, you are now experiencing one of the many great adventures of the 
Storm Ships of Lem-Dagor. Of course this is the famous cruiser, Tempest, 
where your voyage begins. Look around, look at everything for a clue. There 
is a big sign for you to read.

A Shiny Hallway
  The walls of the hallway on the Tempest always have bright colors, and are 
bathing in a shiny, mysterious light. Crew members are walking in several 
directions, looking very busy. They keep moving on along the Hall way, and 
never seem to reach their goal.

[ Exits: north east south west ]
(Golden Aura) You see a promising ensign, who can't wait to get into action.
(Golden Aura) (White Aura) A man is working with a strange device.

  You are at the north end of the hallway. There is a stairwell west from you,
which could bring you to several far-away places of the ship. South is the 
way to the ship's entrance, the Imaginarium and the main engineer room. From 
the east you hear the sounds of men and women talking, laughing and eating.

valuable items. All depends upon your purpose here on The Tempest. Thievery 
or bravery? What will it be?

much time for you anyway.

as well solve some mysteries in this place. For the description of the room: 
When you enter the bridge, you notice a large window, filling the north wall.
It must be a thrill to watch all kinds of spectacular things happen through 
that window. Hey wait! One just appeared. It seems that you have fallen with 
your nose in the butter!

The West Side of the Bridge
  There are some storm ships in which it is very dark, or where you can see 
white clouds appearing everywhere. The Tempest is surely not one of them.
Every room is brightly lit, the floors swabbed and the brass railings buffed.
Everything is so fine and tidy, it is hard to believe it's a ship that 
traverses the ocean on a storm's leading edge.

The West Side of the Bridge
  There are some storm ships in which it is very dark, or where you can see 
white clouds appearing everywhere. The Tempest is surely not one of them.
Every room is brightly lit, the floors swabbed and the brass railings buffed.
Everything is so fine and tidy, it is hard to believe it's a ship that 
traverses the ocean on a storm's leading edge.

  What did I just say: Do not enter the room! Ooh well, stay and play with 
whomever (or whatever) has time for that. And now that you're here, you might
as well solve some mysteries in this place. For the description of the room: 
When you enter the bridge, you notice a large window, filling the north wall.
It must be a thrill to watch all kinds of spectacular things happen through 
that window. Hey wait! One just appeared. It seems that you have fallen with 
your nose in the butter!

  Xena, Andolor's most famous weaponsmith, stands next to a large forge. 
She is speaking with a troll who is testing the feel of a blade in his hand.
Many daggers, swords, flails, and maces sit in racks all neatly organized
for customer access.  A trellis covers this platform, supported by beams
based at each of the four corners.  Various staves and polearms are
suspended from the trellis by large hooks.  A ramp to the north will take
you to a higher platform, while the eastern ramp takes you to a lower one.

heart pine. The wall behind it features a triptych of stained glass
windows depicting Ivar in the midst of a grand bloody battle scene. A
shelf beneath this stained glass contains the most complete selection of
hard alcohol a person could ever conceive. A line of bar stools, made to
match the bar, stands invitingly in front of it. To the south of the bar,
a dozen dartboards have been established upon the wall, and several
red-cloth billiard tables wait patiently for pub patrons to begin a game.
To the west of the bar, Ivar has set up a stage and dance floor for a
different form of entertainment.

point sharply towards the sky as if trying to pierce the clouds for their

the skilled craftsman's district of town.  Best concentrate on the here and

  Few people linger long on this stretch of Fairdeal Alley.  An almost
palpable feeling of malevolence and danger makes all but the bravest (or
most despicable) of adventurers feel uncomfortable.  Rather than admire
the sights, most choose to move west toward the raucous comforts of Ivar's
Pub, or east to Meridian Square.  Still, there is enough traffic to
suggest that, in spite of the danger, a cautious adventurer may discover a
few things of interest here...

  A giant arch marks the western entrance to the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
When the city was young, an observer at Meridian Square could look to the
west and watch the sun disappear through the arch. But, as Aylor grew,
buildings sprang up to block the way.  Still the arch remains, a remnant of
the forerunners who built the greatest city Andolor has known.  Though the
bustle of the market is all around, the Sunset Arch is a place to remember
those who have gone before, and to meditate on friends and loved ones who
have moved on.  When the arch was built, it was simple and unadorned, but
over the years its surface has become covered with countless names carved
into the rock.  Some are fresh, jagged scars, others worn to near
illegibility, but the stone remembers them all.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to
scrape the clouds as they pass overhead.  The foremost feature of Meridian
Square is the memorial fountain, which pumps crystal clear water into the
sky year round.  A detachment of city guards known as the Honor Guard keep
watch over the fountain day and night.  The practical reason is to prevent
any defacement, but myth-lovers claim that they protect the massive marble
bier at the center of the fountain which is said to hold a container of the
Water of Life.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

Syntax:  eqsearch <item>            : Searches eq against carried item.

         autoeq                     : Turn off notifications.
 
The 'eqsearch' command can be used to help you find better equipment for
your level. Typing 'eqsearch all' will check each of your wear locations
to see if there is a better item on the searchable list for your level.

To see all items for a particular wear location, use the syntax 'eqsearch
<wear loc>'. You can also compare an item in your inventory to items on
the searchable item list using 'eqsearch <item>'.  When searching all
items for a single wear location you can also use 'eqsearch <location>
<min points>' to only list items with at least that many points.

The scoring used in 'eqsearch' is based on your compare settings. You
can allocate different weights to each stat to customize the scoring based 
on your preferences. See 'help compare' for more information on this.

The list of items used by 'eqsearch' is a small set of all game items and
is mostly open clan equipment along with a small number of game-load
items. There may be better items available such as quest equipment or goal 
rewards. Exploration is definitely worth while to find better items, but
the eqsearch command is a great tool to help keep your equipment generally 
up to date.

You will only see items on 'eqsearch all' that you can use right now, so
the list of items may change as you gain levels. You will (by default) 
receive a notification when you level if there are items that are on this 
list that are better than what you are currently wearing. To toggle this 
notification off or back on, type 'autoeq'.

This command does not check items currently in inventory- see 'help 
compare' for information on how to check equipment against items carried
in inventory. Eqsearch will display (Invis) next to an item if it is an 
invisible item, but be sure to use a detect invis potion or spell when 
looking at the shops, as the item will not be displayed unless you can see 
it.

When using the wear location syntax to search for items, you can also use
special wear location names such as "ears", "wrists", "fingers", "weapon"
and "neck". These wear location names cover slots where you can wear 
more than one of each type of item and will show both worn items.
 
To find potions and other magical items, see 'help potsearch'

Help Keywords : Eqsearch.
Help Category : Equipment.
Related Helps : Autoeq, Compare, Equipment, Potsearch, Wearable.
Last Updated  : 2017-08-09 21:55:26.

Syntax:  eqsearch <item>            : Searches eq against carried item.
         eqsearch <wear-loc/group>  : Searches eq for given wear-location.
         eqsearch all               : Lists best option for all eq slots.
         autoeq                     : Turn off notifications.
 
The 'eqsearch' command can be used to help you find better equipment for
your level. Typing 'eqsearch all' will check each of your wear locations
to see if there is a better item on the searchable list for your level.

To see all items for a particular wear location, use the syntax 'eqsearch
<wear loc>'. You can also compare an item in your inventory to items on
the searchable item list using 'eqsearch <item>'.  When searching all
items for a single wear location you can also use 'eqsearch <location>
<min points>' to only list items with at least that many points.

The scoring used in 'eqsearch' is based on your compare settings. You
can allocate different weights to each stat to customize the scoring based 
on your preferences. See 'help compare' for more information on this.

The list of items used by 'eqsearch' is a small set of all game items and
is mostly open clan equipment along with a small number of game-load
items. There may be better items available such as quest equipment or goal 
rewards. Exploration is definitely worth while to find better items, but
the eqsearch command is a great tool to help keep your equipment generally 
up to date.

You will only see items on 'eqsearch all' that you can use right now, so
the list of items may change as you gain levels. You will (by default) 
receive a notification when you level if there are items that are on this 
list that are better than what you are currently wearing. To toggle this 
notification off or back on, type 'autoeq'.

This command does not check items currently in inventory- see 'help 
compare' for information on how to check equipment against items carried
in inventory. Eqsearch will display (Invis) next to an item if it is an 
invisible item, but be sure to use a detect invis potion or spell when 
looking at the shops, as the item will not be displayed unless you can see 
it.

When using the wear location syntax to search for items, you can also use
special wear location names such as "ears", "wrists", "fingers", "weapon"
and "neck". These wear location names cover slots where you can wear 
more than one of each type of item and will show both worn items.

  This small stand is surrounded by an average sized fence, which has
only three openings to let customers into the shop.  The small fence

reds, blues, magentas, and greens.  Many signs sit everywhere, saying,
"Do not touch!",  "Leave it alone!",  and "Hands to Yourself!".

The Aylorian Bank of Ivar (G)
  Many rumors surround the Bank of Ivar.  Older adventurers remember the
primitive bank location and large vault where money was stored.  This bank
consists of a single eldar standing behind a large wooden desk.  He wears
only a simple brown robe and a pair of gloves that provide coverage up to
his shoulders.  The desk houses a single large hole that leads to places
unknown.  Many people have ventured to guess the location of where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.

You watch as the eldar reaches into the hole to pull out pouch after
pouch of perfectly counted gold coins.  The only greater mystery here is how
the eldar is able to manipulate the hole, since any hand that reaches into
the hole pulls back nothing but a bloody stub.

  All throughout Andolor, the Grand City of Aylor is known for three things.
The first is of course, the mighty, the generous, the magnificent Ivar.  The
second is its impressive architecture.  The third, but not the least
important, is its shopping.  It is said that if there's anything to be
found, somebody is already selling it on the streets of Aylor.  As you look
around the insanely hectic Grandmarket Boulevard, you don't doubt it for one
moment.

Among the Philosophes (G)
  To the south of the Grand Plaza is a magnificent Stoa built entirely of
white marble.  A series of steps lead into the body proper of the building,
which is encircled by peristyle ionic columns and decorated in the ionic
style.  The greatest minds of all Andolor congregate here to debate matters
of philosophy, or just to think great thoughts in the same corridors where
thinkers past have done so.  The most sought-out magister of them all is
Questor, who dispenses worldly knowledge and experience by giving
assignments to those who ask.  Those who yearn for knowledge and
understanding flock to the Stoa, and they are never disappointed.  Any time
of day or night, conversations can be heard on subjects as lofty as the
meaning of life and the nature of death and the hereafter.

The Grand Plaza (G)
  The south end of the plaza is traditionally home to salesmen of a more
refined sort.  The proximity of the Mage and Psionicist Guilds to the east
and the Stoa to the south guarantee that the sellers of rare books and
antiquities that gather here always have business.  Snatches of excited
conversation about this or that rare edition float about on the air, and
occasionally a voice will be raised to accuse some dishonest peddler of
pushing forgeries.  The Plaza Guards are more numerous here to guarantee the
security of the valuable goods for sale, as well as the safety of the
well-laden coin purses that dangle from the all-too-numerous belts.

>>    *[NOEXP]* Meridian Square (G)
  The focal point of the Grand Plaza of Aylor is Meridian Square, built not
to honor the sun, but rather the city itself.  In this place, the heart of
Aylor, the city's glory is always at its zenith.  The square honors the
spirit of defiance that made the founders of Aylor build a city so great
that its brightness would rival the sun's, its mighty towers so tall as to

  Day or night, people can be found in the Grand Plaza of Aylor. 
Merchants, both honest and otherwise, hock their wares, mercenaries offer
their services, and, once the sun sets, a bit of "company" is only an alley
away.  Plaza Guards mill through the crowd, keeping a weather eye out for
pickpockets, cutpurses, and other ne'er-do-wells.  The vast expanse of the
square is packed with all manner of booths and tables, but in the end most
eyes are drawn to the far corners of the plaza and to the Guild towers that
dominate them-each unique, and each magnificent.  The plaza is a place to
see and be seen, to buy and to sell, each according to his own agenda.

  The sounds of the city echo between the buildings that line the sides of
this broad street.  Standing here, the oppressive size of the city is fully
evident.  The northern sky is dominated by the elegant spires of the Grand
Aylorian Temple, while the southern horizon is punctuated by glimpses of the
Guild towers.  A queer building rises up on the eastern side of the street,
though it seems to have developed a slight list to one side.  The door to
the building is boarded over and bears a sign reading: "Out of Order!!!! 
Decapitation Hazard!!  --Tinker's Guild Safety Committee."  In its place,
a complex series of pulleys operates a bucket that carries visitors up to a
second floor window.  Ominous explosions, thuds, and various other sounds of
mass destruction escape the building at random intervals.  In an alley
beside the slanting structure, a giant, clockwork machine of some sort
occasionally belches out clouds of smoke and fire.  A series of crudely
hammered metal chutes leading down from the upper stories of the structure
rains trash down into the incinerator.  A large sign in the alley reads:
"Posted: Hard Hat Zone."

  The trail continues through the forest, and leads to the other side of what 
appears to be a very small atoll. The forest becomes more and more dense as 
you venture further from the beach. Thick underbrush encroaches upon the 
trail and as a result, you must use your weapon to clear the way.

A Path in the Wilderness
  The path leads south and east, away from the beach to the west. There is an 
enclosure of some kind to the east, and to the south there is a hut built of 
stone and thatch. The path itself is surprisingly wide, and trampled by very 
large, bare feet.

Land of the Lotus Eaters
  The forest floor is covered in undergrowth that has been flattened by paths 
that criss-cross in all directions, but appear to go nowhere in particular.
Following one path leads into another, which doubles back and returns to 
where you might have started, an hour or a day ago. But what's this? There is
a hole in the ground here. Perhaps it is a way out.

The Caverns of the Dead
   A little light from the opening above you exposes a series of caverns that 
run in all directions, much like the paths above ground. The caverns are 
natural, rather than constructed. They are damp, and the floors are uneven.
Old bones are scattered here, perhaps thrown down by the creatures living 
above ground.

Seagulls and some much larger birds fly overhead. The smaller birds are in

The Old Man of the Sea
  The old man of the sea is a huge giant sitting on a rock, playing with full 
sized ships that he places into the water and using his great lungs, he 
blows them in any direction that takes his fancy. Most of the boats are 
unmanned but occasionally, the old man finds a drowning sailor and, saving 
him (merely for fun), drops him into a boat and sends him on his way.

A giant roc appears in the sky above, and swoops down, and perhaps thinking 
one of the old man's boats is a fish, grabs it with its great claws.

Land of the Daemon Birds
  You are wading out into the ocean. To the north, there is a narrow beach and 
beyond it, a rocky cliff rises dramatically into the sky. A large bird, 
perhaps an eagle, circles high above you. It calls shrilly to another of its 
kind, then disappears into the clouds.

there sits a large throne that seems to be carved right out of the wall. 
Upon the throne sits a slightly cracked statue that is the source of the
faint light.  

[ Exits: south ]
(White Aura) A cracked statue is placed here giving off an eerie glow.
A cracked statue says, "Greetings, follower of the light."
A cracked statue says, "Long ago I was carved from the stones of this
 place. I have seen when the light and dark worked together in harmony, a
 perfect balance. Then something happened, suddenly they started warring.
 Nobody knows why or who is to blame. Obviously, the light blames the dark
 and the dark blames the light. Luckily, Malcrom is attempting to figure
 out who is truly to blame."
A cracked statue says, "If you would like to hear more, please indicate
 that you accept."
A cracked statue says, "If you don't want to help, you may either join the
 dark or join the light."

The darkside of the coin
  You open your eyes and see you are above the clouds at the base of 
a great citadel.  The beginning of a wicked looking labyrinth looms 
before you.  The sounds of vile creatures that inhabit this place 
reach your ears.  Beyond the labyrinth you can see the tower that 
must hold something of value to have such evil sounding creatures 
guarding it.

  The corridors of the labyrinth seem to twist and turn.  You look around

you see illusions of yourself, each dying a more horrific death than the

  After finally escaping the labyrinth you stop to catch your breath.  So
far, you are still alive and have high hopes of surviving.  The crawl space
you find yourself in has many odd shaped holes in the floor.  With the right
timing you might be able to drop an object and have it land near a friend as
the citadel passes by.

An opening to a forest
  This forest seems oddly cheery.  You can hear birds singing and small
woodland animals scurrying around in the underbrush.  The trees have grown
thickly but not enough to block your way.  There seems to be only one thing
lacking - a path.

Cutting through the weeds
  After cutting through some of the underbrush, you are starting to notice
stranger noises than before.  That, coupled with the stench close to that of
a rotting cow, makes you begin to think again about coming this way.

The West Side of the Bridge
  There are some storm ships in which it is very dark, or where you can see 
white clouds appearing everywhere. The Tempest is surely not one of them.
Every room is brightly lit, the floors swabbed and the brass railings buffed.
Everything is so fine and tidy, it is hard to believe it's a ship that 
traverses the ocean on a storm's leading edge.

  What did I just say: Do not enter the room! Ooh well, stay and play with 
whomever (or whatever) has time for that. And now that you're here, you might
as well solve some mysteries in this place. For the description of the room: 
When you enter the bridge, you notice a large window, filling the north wall.
It must be a thrill to watch all kinds of spectacular things happen through 
that window. Hey wait! One just appeared. It seems that you have fallen with 
your nose in the butter!

  You are at the north end of the hallway. There is a stairwell west from you,
which could bring you to several far-away places of the ship. South is the

the east you hear the sounds of men and women talking, laughing and eating.

  A high rocky outcropping provides a perfect wall blocking the stinging and

almost perfectly calm. But it is terribly hot and dry - stinking hot would be
an understatement. A long tall glass of water would be welcome but there is 
none to be had, unless a merciful djinn, eager to please, were to grant a 
wish.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.

  The walls of the hallway on the Tempest always have bright colors, and are 
bathing in a shiny, mysterious light. Crew members are walking in several 
directions, looking very busy. They keep moving on along the Hall way, and 
never seem to reach their goal.

officers. Down are the private rooms, where you might find some of their 
valuable items. All depends upon your purpose here on The Tempest. Thievery 
or bravery? What will it be?

The West Side of the Bridge
  There are some storm ships in which it is very dark, or where you can see 
white clouds appearing everywhere. The Tempest is surely not one of them.
Every room is brightly lit, the floors swabbed and the brass railings buffed.
Everything is so fine and tidy, it is hard to believe it's a ship that 
traverses the ocean on a storm's leading edge.

The Grand City of Aylor (G)
  You stand on the edge of the beautiful City of Aylor.
 
A bright light shines down from the heavens, pouring over you, bathing you
in its warm glow.  Everything around you seems rich and pure in color.  An
enormous, white temple stands to the north, taking up most of your view.
 
To reach the Aylorian Academy, you must travel up the large staircase that
stands just off the side of the church.  (Type 'UP' to learn how to play the
game.)
 
Below you are large piles of armor and equipment discarded by other
adventurers.
