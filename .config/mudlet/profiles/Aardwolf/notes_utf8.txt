# STATS - 
Mage
* Intelligence is by far the most important stat for a mage to focus on. 
  Int will allow the mage to do far more damage with their combat spells.
* Wisdom is also important for a mage; it helps spells' damage and will
  help protect you from offensive spells.  The higher Wis also helps with
  the increased healing and protection you will need.
* As always, Luck affects everything, including spell success and damage.
* Melee combat is still important as a spellcaster.  Try to keep your
  Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution high to make better use of your
  physical attacks between spellcasting and when mana runs low.
